The villagers have almost cleaned up the remains of the puppet corpses on the road, but for some reason, they all looked at her with a very sympathetic expression.

As an outer disciple, she was provided with a small wooden house that sheltered her from wind and rain throughout the seasons, but occasionally it was troublesome when it leaked or got damaged.

However, it didn't matter as she was a skilled repairman, proficient in all eighteen martial arts. Fixing a leaky roof was a piece of cake for her.

After a long time, Xia Ge finally arrived in front of her little house.

Staring deeply at her small wooden house, Xia "Little Handyman" Ge's face twitched slightly.

...Can anyone tell her what happened?

The system sighed without any sympathy, "It's so tragic."

Xia Ge slowly raised her head, looking at the black giant scythe that had fallen from who knows where and was now embedded in her roof. Her mood suddenly became very desolate.

She hadn't noticed how huge the scythe was during her battle with the demonic puppet, but compared to Chu Yao's sword, it was enormous.

The giant scythe blade, about one meter long, was inserted into the roof, and the two-meter-long scythe handle pointed straight to the moonlit sky. The lock chain at the end of the handle fluttered in the night wind, making a jingling sound.

Even as a handyman, isn't this level of destruction beyond her ability!?

Xia Ge comforted herself with the one or two silver ingots she had in her arms, "A thousand houses, a thousand homes..."

The system replied, "That's not realistic."

Xia Ge had to face reality, "So, I just received a huge sum of money today, and tomorrow I have to use it to repair the roof?!!!"

The system kindly said, "It might not be enough."

Was that bastard doing it on purpose!?

Xia Ge thought, "I want to challenge her one-on-one!!!"

It would have been better to compensate her with ten pancakes!!!

Thinking of the huge sum of money she had just received, which would disappear tomorrow because of the falling scythe, countless grass mud horses were galloping through Xia Ge's heart.
Carefully unlocking the lock and pushing open her dilapidated wooden door, Xia Ge stood in the corner, staring at the precarious roof beam pierced by a scythe from the sky. The half-blade sparkled under the faint candlelight she had lit, as if mocking her helplessness.

"Xiao Gui, I've been thinking, this won't do," Xia Ge said in a solemn voice. "I think we need to find a way to make some money."

The system wisely kept its mouth shut.

Whenever Xia Ge started thinking about making money, it was always the first one to be scammed.

What she was thinking was not a way to make money, but a way to fleece people!

Xia Ge urged, "Xiao Gui, in times like this, why can't we unite? Look at our common property - don't you feel heartbroken? Don't you want to do something for your dear host?"

The system remained indifferent.

Not at all.

Xia Ge was distressed. "Xiao Gui, even if not for the host, but for yourself - can't we take down the scythe on our heads and sell it for some silver?"

The system: "..."

The system rarely spoke, "If you take it down, the room will collapse."

Xia Ge was full of righteousness. "Aren't you a system?"

The system: "..."

The system said, "Host, I advise you to upgrade as soon as possible. Don't delay. After you upgrade, you won't have to ask me to sell the scythe for money."

Xia Ge asked, "Why?"

The system: "..."

After upgrading, stealing chickens and dogs, robbing houses and so on, would be easy. Why bother selling the scythe here?

Xia Ge saw that the system remained silent for a long time and finally sighed, looking like a child who had grown up. "Ah, Xiao Gui has become smarter and knows how to change the subject..."

The system said, "After upgrading, the host can try robbing houses and climb to the pinnacle of life."

Xia Ge said, "Am I that kind of person?! Xiao Gui, I can't believe you think of me that way. You really disappoint me!"


The system responded coldly, "Oh."

Xia Ge's eyebrows furrowed suddenly and she looked serious. "But speaking of upgrading, Little Puppet, I do have a very important question to ask you."

The system saw that the host was rarely serious and couldn't help but adjust its tone subconsciously. "What is it?"

Xia Ge said seriously, "Is it easier to steal Spirit Wood from the back mountain after upgrading?"

The system: "..."

Damn it, if this trash host is believed to have a bit of integrity, this system will be invincible. Let it go to the recycle bin and be rebuilt!

Regardless of the bickering, the matter of upgrading was indeed urgent.

Xia Ge opened the window and looked outside. She lived alone in this small house. Originally, Ye Ze lived in the room next to hers and would often come back to stay. After passing the entrance exam, Lingxi Peak would arrange a residence on the mountain specifically for inner disciples, but this kid still often stayed down the mountain.

But today, it seemed that he was too busy with his studies and couldn't come down the mountain.

When there were too many classes, he wouldn't come down.

The night was deep, and there was no one around. The puppets' corpses along the way were disposed of quickly, and the ground was already clean. Perhaps her scythe was a bit difficult to deal with, so it was left for tomorrow.

So... let's just stay here.

The small house was very old. There was a simple four-legged wooden bed against the wall, and each leg of the bed had a small wooden board with four corners like a horseshoe. The warm yellow quilt was neatly spread out. Xia Ge yawned, closed the window, and squatted by the bed. Come to think of it, she was too busy copying books these past two days and didn't have time to sun the quilt...

She held one of the left rear legs of the bed with one hand and lifted all four legs of the bed. The bed legs with the four square wooden boards were lifted, revealing a hidden space on the ground.

It turned out that a small hole was dug under the bed legs, covered by the bed legs' "horseshoes." A small iron box was hidden inside the hole.

Xia Ge took out the iron box and took out the contents carefully. Then, she took out one or two silver coins from her pocket and put them into the box before carefully putting the small iron box back in place.

The system asked, "Are those one or two silver coins really that important?!"

Xia Ge looked like she understood the hardships of life and said, "Little Puppet, that's a huge sum of money."

The system:...

There was a small iron box hidden under each of the four bed legs.

Xia Ge took them out one by one.
You can use white clay to make the puppet's skin, small black stones for the eyes, black silk for the hair, bone jade for the bones, and finally, lychee wood for the flesh and blood.

In front of the closed window is a small table. Xia Ge arranged everything in a row and looked at the black stone among them, tilting her head and suddenly laughing. "Speaking of which..."

System: "Hmm?"

"'The son of Bi Liu, left me with a jade pendant.'" Xia Ge picked up the black stone and couldn't help but squint her eyes. "Such a powerful senior sister, but her name is just a black stone."

System: "..."

The system didn't want to ask Xia Ge what that meant, so it simply checked its database for information.

After checking the information, the system couldn't help but defend, "What black stone? That's a beautiful jade of a light black color."

Xia Ge sighed, "So, Little Puppet, you really are just after Senior Sister's beauty."

System: "..."

"Ah, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Even a black stone can be praised as a beautiful jade." Xia Ge didn't know if she was thinking of the other's stunning beauty or her own pitiful comparison of being "ugly", and hummed twice. "Anyway, in my eyes, a black stone is just a black stone!"

The system chuckled, "You're not even as good as a black stone."

Xia Ge wisely changed the subject, "All the materials are here, how do we make it?"

The system snorted. That's why the result of teasing someone often ends up with one's own face hurting.

Author's note:

Xia Ge: Ah, beautiful jade. _(:ли)Рѕа)_

Senior Sister: Heh.
