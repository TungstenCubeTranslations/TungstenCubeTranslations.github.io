After two days and two nights without sleep, even an iron man couldn't hold on. When Xia Ge lay down, she slept straight through until noon the next day.

When she opened her eyes, Xia Ge still felt deeply tired and had a headache that wouldn't go away.

The little puppet lay quietly at the head of her bed, having lost yesterday's agility. The colorful glass skin from yesterday was now a wooden color, and it had also become much smaller. Yesterday, it was the size of a palm, now it was only the size of a child's wooden doll, about an inch square, as if it had been casually carved and played with by a child.

Xia Ge rubbed her temples and got up, picked up the doll, and asked in a hoarse voice, "Why is it different from yesterday?"

The system voice was lazy, "I told you, it's a low-level puppet. It can only become like yesterday when you drive it."

Xia Ge held the doll with a puzzled look on her face, "How do I drive it?"

"{Control Soul Walk Sound}." The system paused, "This skill is something every puppet master must know. It is the most basic skill for controlling puppets."

"Host, you have to learn to play an instrument."

Xia Ge: "......"

Xia Ge silently put the wooden doll in her pocket, "Ah, let's talk about it later."

She was so poor that she could hardly afford to eat, where would she find time to study music, chess, calligraphy, and painting?

Annoying.

After a simple cleanup, Xia Ge looked up at the black sickle above her head, which was about to fall. She took her identity jade pendant and went out.

The system thought Xia Ge would find the village carpenter Zhang to help her take down the sickle, but she headed straight up the mountain.

The system said, "...aren't you going to fix the house?"

Xia Ge said, "I'm getting paid today!"

The system said, "..."

Ninety copper coins were indeed a huge sum of money for the host.

But shouldn't a normal person fix their house first?!

Xia Ge said, "I want to get intimate with my huge sum of money for a while."

System: "... "= =
Danfeng's Ministry of Internal Affairs, where the money was distributed, was not far away, and Xia Ge arrived after walking for a while. Today was indeed the day for distributing money to the outer disciples, but everyone who was supposed to receive it had already received it in the morning. It was rare for someone to come and increase their workload after noon.

Liu Xiaoqian, the accountant, stared at the account book, his brush drawing on the paper, his brow furrowed.

"Hehe, Brother Liu, I'm here to collect my salary."

A clear teenage voice interrupted Liu Xiaoqian's thoughts. Liu Xiaoqian came back to his senses and saw that it was Xia Ge. His face suddenly turned unhappy. "Xia Wuyin? Why are you here so late?"

Xia Ge scratched his head and smiled, "I was caught by Senior Ye to do something today and couldn't come back for a while. I came to collect my money as soon as I got back."

The system silently criticized its host for being good at lying again.

"Forget it." Liu Xiaoqian's face eased a little. Many outer disciples were temporarily called to help the inner disciples, so he didn't find it strange. He dealt with it impartially and made a few marks on the account book. "Xia Wuyin... three hundred copper coins."

Xia Ge was stunned. Three hundred copper coins?

Wasn't it supposed to be ninety copper coins?

But she still smiled brightly, "Thank you so much."

Liu Xiaoqian tore off a slip of paper and handed it to Xia Ge. "Go to the accounting room over there to collect it."

Xia Ge took the slip of paper and took two steps towards the accounting room, but stopped.

She turned her head slightly, "Brother Liu, did you calculate too much money?"

Liu Xiaoqian snorted, "If I calculated too much, it wouldn't be too much for anyone but you. Yesterday, Senior Sister suddenly changed the rules and said that the outer disciples guarding Danfeng also deserve credit, so their salary has been doubled."

He glanced at Xia Ge, "You got lucky. Go and collect your money."

Xia Ge's eyebrows suddenly raised, and she happily went to the accounting room to collect her money. As she walked out with the heavy copper coins, she heard a voice calling her name.

"Xiao Kui."

The system lazily responded, "Hmm?"

"You were right."

The system was confused, "???"
 
Xia Ge smirked but didn't explain.
The sun shone brightly in the distance as a young boy with green hair tied a kiss on his money bag. His black eyes shimmered with a light.

"That is indeed a beautiful piece of black jade," he thought silently.

The vast wilderness echoed with the howls of wolves.

"A song to calm the soul," said a girl in a blood-red fur coat, her voice gentle and alluring, "Singing the world to its end."

The girl leaned against the rooftop, holding a white bone flute in her jade-like hand. The red knot at the end of the flute fluttered in the wind, and her beauty was accentuated by the moonlight, with her long eyebrows and slender eyes, red lips and white skin, a natural enchantress.

A somewhat childish voice sounded, and a young boy with a half-iron mask knelt on one knee. "Leader, it's midnight. You should go to bed."

"The moon is so beautiful tonight," the girl's voice was round and full of charm, her long eyes slanted into her hair, and although she was only fifteen or sixteen years old, every smile and gesture was alluring. "I am not sleepy."

"Yes," the boy replied softly.

The night was cool in the forest.

The girl's fingers, as white as spring onions, gently stroked the bone flute, as if caressing her lover. "What about Lingxi Peak?"

"Lingxi Peak found out that the demonic puppet that was released was destroyed by the backup disciple of Jianfeng with one sword," the boy hesitated for a moment, "Chu Yao of Chang'an's Chu family."

"So be it," the girl didn't seem to care, she gently put the bone flute into her arms, the large red sleeves covering the flute's shadow, and her long eyebrows curved slightly. "Is it Chu Yao, the one from Chang'an's Chu family?"

The boy nodded slightly, "Yes."

"It's really sad," the girl's voice was gentle, "It's such a good mountain, but there are always people who make it hard to look at."

With an unintentional remark, the boy trembled all over, his body trembling imperceptibly.

"Are you afraid of me?" the girl laughed lightly, "Why are you afraid of me?"

The boy was about to reply, but the girl raised her hand slightly, stopping him.

She slowly stood up, her red lips curling slightly, "It's okay to be afraid of me."
The young child Nono dared not speak.

"Speak up," the young girl chuckled, covering her lips. "What new talents have emerged in Lingxi Mountain recently, besides Chu Yao, the candidate for the top disciple position, and Chang Lan, who has temporarily taken over the position?"

"Other than those two, there's also Gu Peijiu, the newly appointed top disciple of Danfeng," the young child replied, lowering his head.

"Gu Peijiu?" 

The sound of the wind suddenly stopped.

"I don't like the sound of this top disciple's name," the young girl said, her voice low.

The young child remained silent.

"Baizhi, I'll give you three thousand puppets. Find a way to kill Gu Peijiu," the young girl said slowly. "Okay?"

"Yes!" replied the young child, whose name was Baizhi.

The night wind blew gently and warmly.

Baizhi knelt in the wind, not daring to move a muscle.

The young girl looked up at the bright moon in the sky, her narrow eyes filled with moonlight, both tender and affectionate.

After a long silence, she spoke again.

"It's been so long..." she murmured, stroking her bone flute. Her red cloak fluttered in the wind, and the silver moonlight shattered like ice in her dark eyes. "It's time to send someone to find the news of 'Zhen Hun'."

The white bones were mournful, and the Zhen Hun was unparalleled.

The sound of the flute rang out leisurely. On the wilderness, the eye sockets of countless puppets suddenly lit up with a blue flame that flickered along with the flute's melody.

The howling of the wolves stopped abruptly, replaced by the low growls of the controlled and demonized puppets.

-It's been so long.

-It's time for you to come back.

"I won't let a single person I need to kill escape," the young girl said. 

As the music ended, the puppets let out a long roar, and the soul flames in their eyes became terrifyingly bright, converging into a vast ocean on the vast and desolate wilderness.
The young girl gently caressed the bone flute, her voice tender, "I must be the first one to find you."

-"Only I remember."

I remember how much I love you.

Even if the world is turned upside down, even if a million souls are sacrificed, I will guard your mountain peak, your town spirit, your bones, and wait for you to come back here.
