"Hmph, no wonder you are the famous Chu Knife that sacrifices spirits, but without the battle armor of the knife, you are nothing!" Chang Ren sneered repeatedly, while Chu Yao protected Chu Yi and gradually became a bit overwhelmed under the increasingly numerous attacks.

These people are all controlled, and there are more evil spirits manipulated in the periphery...

"Bang!"

A red-eyed giant punched Chu Yao's right shoulder, causing sudden pain. Chu Yao kicked the person away with one foot, "Get lost!"

Blood dripped down.

Chu Yi stood behind her and returned to her senses from distant memories, surprisingly calm.

She heard her own faint voice, "Why not take a sword?"

Chu Yao said, "The family head asked me to get married. According to the family rules, the marrying party cannot wield a sword--"

Enduring the pain and taking medicine, she even laughed, "The family rules are like this, I have to follow them."

Chu Yi looked at her quietly, "I never knew my sister could be so obedient."

Chu Yao said, "You are the family head, I naturally have to listen to you."

Chu Yi sneered, "I'm afraid it's not that simple."

Chu Yao kicked away someone rushing towards her, "It is that simple."

"My sister doesn't take a knife, not because of marriage, but because the Chu Knife has already been given to someone else." Chu Yi's voice was calm, "My sister has someone she admires, so she gave the Chu Knife to that person. And as an ancient clothing demon, the Chu Knife Sacrifice Spirit looks down on ordinary knives--"

"My sister is not unwilling to wield a sword." Chu Yi said, "She just can't..."

As soon as she finished speaking, Chu Yi's vision went black, and she was hugged again!

At the same time, a cold breath brushed past her ear. For a moment, Chu Yi felt creepy--as if her entire soul would be hooked away as long as that breath touched her even a little!

The Chu Knife Sacrifice Spirit glowed with a warm white light, and Chu Yao's voice sounded in her ear, slightly hoarse, "Hmm."

A strong, bloody smell.

Skin touching skin, Chu Yi could feel the scorching temperature on this person's body, and the jet-black, crow-like long hair falling down. Chu Yi saw the heavy bloodstains on it, and her chin rested on this shoulder--this posture, completely, completely hugged, completely protected posture--

Therefore, no one can understand Chu Yao's state at this moment better than Chu Yi.
She could feel every muscle in her body trembling, every inch of skin under her clothes burning hot. Despite being on the verge of collapsing, she stood like a fortress, using her life to protect the last piece of high ground.

"As long as we stay alive, everything will be alright," the voice in her ear was calm and composed.

However, the temperature was too hot.

Chu Yi had never felt such a scorching heat before.

It was as if this person was about to burn to ashes, but with the last bit of light and radiance, they were shielding her from all disasters and injustices.

She widened her eyes and watched as knives, guns, swords, and halberds charged towards them from behind Chu Yao's back. Her lips trembled slightly.

Chu Yi knew that this person was already exhausted.

She even found it difficult to stand up, with internal and external injuries, no weapons, and had to protect her while being distracted. Yet, they had persisted for so long.

Clearly - clearly, this person was in such a state!

"I..."

- I want you to suffer unbearably.

"I command you..."

- I want you to lose everything.

They were getting closer.

That knife.

So many knives.

It was about to happen...

But Chu Yao held her tightly, as if she was her shield, as if she was everything to her. She used her flesh and blood to protect her peace.

- Why, why at this moment?

Clearly, this person was about to die, clearly, this person seemed to be... about to become what she had imagined. Clearly -
"The person is going to become the way she wants him to be!

But why does she feel like she's the one who's going to lose everything?

Chu Yi heard herself muttering, "Pick up your sword..."

The voice slowly became angry, so angry that it almost turned into a hoarse roar, "Pick it up!! Chu Yao! I... order you, pick up your sword!!"

The voice became hoarse!

Marriage.

The clan, she didn't want them!!

No matter what.

- Don't die!

Chang Lan and Chang Nian, who were trapped in the barrier, widened their eyes, "Junior Sister!"

"Senior Sister!!"

Chu Yao hugged Chu Yi and didn't move a muscle.

Ye Ze forcefully pushed away the people around him, his hand holding the Sword of the Firmament trembling slightly. The Sword of the Firmament didn't recognize him, and he found it particularly difficult to use. He could only watch helplessly as Chu Yao protected Chu Yi and was entangled by others.

Chang Ren sneered, his eyes turning red, "It's better to die, as long as the head of the family is here--"

Chang Lan, who was inside the barrier, said dejectedly, "Father seems to have been possessed by a demon!"

Countless people holding knives, guns, swords, and halberds mercilessly attacked Chu Yao, who was weak but tightly holding Chu Yi.

Chang Ren said, "Die!!"

- Slow.

Her eyes were already blurry.

But... she had to protect the person in her arms."
Slim, fragile, but trying hard to appear strong.

Chu Yao thought, this person is very fragile.

Everywhere...very fragile.

Whether it's the heart, strength, or even the body.

But she is strong.

...So, she must be protected.

Protect her heart, so she decides not to use a sword.

Protect her body, so stand here and embrace her.

She thought, she owes too much.

...

In a distant summer, the proud lady greeted her with a feather fan, "Miss is here again?"

"The little girl with her eyes covered that I saw in Madam's courtyard before," she said, "is she your sister?"

"..."

The noble lady covered her lips with her fan, smiling and looking at her with a smile. Her eyes were clearly smiling, but there was an undisguised coldness.

For some reason, facing this lady...perhaps it was uncomfortable, Chu Yao took a small step back.

"Are you pitying her, Miss?" The lady saw her step back, and the arc under the fan became wider.

Chu Yao did not notice the malice of this person, or rather, with the simple kindness of a gentle mother, Chu Yao could never imagine how twisted a person's soul could become under the jealousy of a venomous snake.

"No, I..."

She tried to calm down and said, "I have something I want to give to my sister as a gift..."

The lady "Oh"ed, looked at the wind chimes hanging on the eaves not far away with a cold gaze, but the smile on her lips did not diminish, "Miss, didn't you already give her a bell?"

Chu Yao's eyes lit up slightly, "Does she like it?"
Madam chuckled three times. "Who knows about her? Children's thoughts are unpredictable."

"Oh..." Chu Yao felt a little disappointed but quickly regained her composure. "Madam, can I see her now?"

Madam Yun fanned herself casually. "She's not in a good mood, she may not want to see anyone."

Chu Yao bit her lip and took out a delicate little gift box from behind her back. "Well... Madam, I heard that her birthday is coming up, so I made her some cloud cake myself."

She blushed a little as she spoke. "Can you please pass it on to her for me?"

Madam Yun glanced at Chu Yao's hand holding the cake. Her delicate hand had some slight scars, as if it had been cut by a knife. When she saw Madam Yun looking at her hand, Chu Yao shyly smiled. "I accidentally cut my hand while slicing it and my father scolded me."

Father... Chu Zhan.

Madam Yun's grip on her fan tightened slightly, but her face maintained a perfect smile. "That's natural."

...

Later, young Chu Yao saw the cloud cake in the trash.

It had been torn open and thrown away like garbage.

It showed how little that person valued it.

"Miss Second is throwing a tantrum again."

"She's really difficult to serve, even when you try to give her something nice..."

"Miss's things were also thrown out..."

Young Chu Yao looked at the messy cake and then at her own hand, which had been cut by a knife. The sound of wind chimes echoed around her as she stood there, feeling lost and unsure of what to do.
... She seems to dislike her.

"Miss?!" The idle servant caught sight of her and was momentarily alarmed. "What are you doing here?"

"That belongs to the miss..." 

"Shh, don't speak."

"What's wrong with her?" Chu Yao asked in confusion. "Does she not like it?"

"Second Miss... doesn't seem to like the cloud cake very much," the servant said awkwardly. They exchanged glances and, in order to divert Chu Yao's attention, a maid with ulterior motives said, "By the way, Second Miss also said... that she never wants to know anything about you."

- She never wants to know anything about you.

... Why?

...

The memories abruptly stopped, and her consciousness finally faded away.

"Father's teachings, I'm sure my sister... will follow them, right?"

"I just want to see you in agony."

"... What gives you the right to be so arrogant?"

"..."

In reality... she wasn't proud at all.

It's just... in front of this person, all she could do was be proud.

A familiar voice echoed.

- I command you to pick up your sword!

This sentence... didn't sound like something she would say.

She had no strength left.

Chu Yao wondered, why pick up a sword, why now...
The sharp blade pierced into her back, but she didn't feel any pain. The fact that the blade fell on her meant that she was not in pain.

"Protect me!!" She hoarsely roared, with a choked voice. "I command you, pick up the knife and protect me!!"

- I am protecting you. I am holding you, I won't let go, I won't be like before, so easily...

"Don't marry anyone!! You always, always stay in the Chu family!! Live on!! Pick up the knife!! Protect me!! Then live on-"

The scorching tears fell on her shoulder, causing a painful sting.

"I... I can't..."

"I can't... lose you again."

Please-

The scorching tears were a bit hurtful.

Chu Yao suddenly opened her eyes!

And in the next moment, the dazzling golden light pierced through the sky and fell into Chu Yao's hands. The powerful spiritual power instantly overturned the blade that had been chopped on her body!

"...I told you you were useless."

Her voice was still hoarse. "What's the point of crying?"

In the girl's hand was a suddenly appeared sharp long knife. In the moment the knife was in her hand, her entire aura suddenly changed!

"Don't cry." She slowly helped Chu Yi out of her arms, and her light brown almond eyes were filled with a casual air. "Watch me beat them all up."

With the long sword in hand, the Chu Knife Sacrifice Spirit was now complete!

Others couldn't see it, but Chu Yi could see it clearly. The reason why Chu Yao recovered so quickly was entirely due to the temporary support of the spiritual power of the complete Chu Knife Sacrifice Spirit.

The external injuries were temporarily stopped by the spiritual power of the Chu Knife Sacrifice Spirit, but the internal injuries had not healed!

Chang Ren was shocked: "Where did the sword come from?!"
Ye Ze's Skyshine was only half-hearted, coupled with his newly acquired power at the ground level, the force he exerted was almost negligible. However, Chu Yao was different.

The Chu family's Chu Dao Sacrificial Spirit, as long as it was recognized by the Chu Dao Sacrificial Spirit and had the blood of the Chu family, could fully exert its power!

Previously, the Chu Dao Sacrificial Spirit without the Chu Dao and Chu Yao could only be considered half-hearted, but now with the Chu Dao - a complete Chu Dao Sacrificial Spirit - this was not a joke!

The long knife was cold, and Chu Yao casually drew a circle around Chu Yi with the tip of her knife. The ground that was touched by the tip of the knife lit up with a brilliant golden light, protecting Chu Yi within it. The cold and evil wind could not get any closer!

"Where did the sword come from?"

Hearing this question, Chu Yao sneered, pointing her snowy white long knife at Chang Ren, her light brown pupils shining with golden light. "You asked the wrong question."

Chang Ren remained calm, "Where did I..."

Suddenly, a gust of wind blew.

The girl's casual voice, accompanied by the sound of the cold blade brushing through the wind, sounded in his ears, "This is not a sword, it's a knife."

"It's called the Chu Dao."

"Swish -"

Chang Ren's pupils shrank, and he immediately opened a powerful barrier. In the blink of an eye, the round barrier had bounced a hundred meters away. However, just as he stabilized himself, the barrier shattered as if it had been cut by a knife.

Chang Ren was trapped in the middle of the shattered barrier, his face looking very ugly.

Chu Yao stood where Chang Ren had just been sitting, crushing the chair under her foot. She pointed her snowy white long knife at Chang Ren, her lips sharp and cold.

"Do you understand now?"

Just then, they heard the miserable howling of evil spirits outside!

They also heard Huo Ming's voice, full of shock and excitement, "What?!"

Chang Ren exclaimed, "What's going on?!"

Huo Ming said, "Evil spirits -"

Chang Ren looked up and suddenly realized that the black-clothed girl in mid-air was controlling the evil spirits, one by one, like a suicide, into an incredibly huge vortex of spiritual power. They howled miserably, and in the midst of lightning and thunder, Gu Peijiu protected the black-clothed girl with her long sword!

Huo Ming's voice was both shocked and excited, "It's her - she actually came! I actually, I actually didn't notice at all! That's great -"
Silent and unnoticed.

Chang Ren had not yet recovered from the shock of losing the demon's defense when he heard a ghostly voice of a girl in his ear, "Where are you looking?"

"Chirp -"

A snow-white long sword pierced through his abdomen.

Chang Ren widened his eyes.

==

Xia Ge prepared the materials and nodded towards Gu Peijiu. Suddenly, she felt a slight warmth in her chest.

"Huh?"

Gu Peijiu asked, "What's wrong?"

She looked towards the source of the powerful spiritual energy, which was in Xia Ge's chest. She reached in and suddenly realized, "It's..."

As soon as she pulled it out, it shone brightly!

Gu Peijiu instinctively narrowed her eyes. Before she could see what was in Xia Ge's hand, it broke through the barrier like a sharp sword and rushed into the courtyard like a released arrow!!

Xia Ge's hand was empty, "It's..."

"It's the sword tassel." Gu Peijiu saw it clearly and looked at Xia Ge with a meaningful gaze, "It's the spiritual power from the Chu Dao Ji Ling."

Xia Ge: "...Haha, I was just about to tell you... Haha."

Gu Peijiu paused, "This aura is..."
