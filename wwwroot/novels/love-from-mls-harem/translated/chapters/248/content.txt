Sunlight filtered through the tiny gaps between the leaves, casting layers of bright and sparkling light and shadow.

Xia Ge leaned her head against the rough tree trunk, listening to Wu Di Kui telling her a story that seemed both distant and familiar.

She listened to everything as if it were someone else's story, dreamlike and unreal.

In the story, there was a carefree puppeteer who loved a princess named Chu Shi. In order to help the princess conquer the world, he took the final steps towards destruction.

On his downhill journey, there was a dashing first puppet and a proud little girl in red.

The white puppet and the haughty little girl silently loved the puppeteer, one quiet and reserved, the other overflowing with emotion.

"... Does the puppeteer like that puppet?" Xia Ge felt her lips slightly dry and licked them, gazing at the dancing sunlight, and thought of the back of the white-clad girl she had seen before naming her lovesickness.

Lonely and desolate, it was like a person had walked through a long period of time.

It was heart-wrenching.

The system said, "Maybe she likes him."

"After all, her princess has already achieved great success, but the puppet has always been by her side."

"Well, she's really trash then, liking whoever she wants," Xia Ge said.

Wu Di Kui's voice carried some tolerance, "I don't think so. When the person you like gives up on you and goes to like someone who likes you, it's also a kind of completeness."

"After all, people are not made of stone, and they will always be lonely." The system paused and said, "After all, life is so long, and there are not many decades to wait."

Wu Di Kui was probably so tolerant because he had experienced those lonely times together with Xia Wu Shuang.

When Xia Wu Shuang was alone missing her princess, there was always someone behind her, in the place where she could turn around and see.

Just turn around, and you could see her silently standing behind you, dressed in white as snow, serene and peaceful.

It was an unparalleled sense of security.

Subtle and silent, making you feel that no matter what you were doing, no matter where you were, no matter why you were feeling sad, she was there behind you, accompanying you through it all.
She will accompany you through the ten years of waiting for someone, through the next ten lonely years, through the rock-solid ten years, and through the few and far between ten years of your life.

Never give up.

When did Xia Wushuang realize that she liked that person?

The system thought for a long time, but couldn't come up with an answer.

Perhaps because it was just a system and couldn't really understand her.

Or maybe it was because Xia Wushuang's lonely ten years had too many moments where she could see that person just by turning her head.

It began with companionship.

And ended with love.

There were too many moments that could have made Xia Wushuang fall for Gu Peijiu.

"What about Su Chan?" Xia Ge asked.

"Su Chan is a fallen god. The Puppet Master has always hoped that she could one day let go of her inner demons and truly return to the heavens." The system said, "So don't be sad...this is probably the result you wanted to see back then."

Xia Ge opened her hand and looked at the palm lines: "I always feel like I forgot something important..."

In a fleeting moment, on a lonely cliff, someone said to the girl in red, "The sea is wide enough for fish to leap, and the sky is high enough for birds to fly."

The system laughed, "Haha, that's it."

The invincible puppet didn't mention Xia Wushuang's words from a long time ago, "No matter what you do, I will forgive you."

It felt like it was no longer necessary. Saying such things would only cause unnecessary sadness and serve no other purpose.

People who leave live in memories, and people who live in memories cannot be forgiven.

This ending was already the best.

The sky slowly darkened, and the crystal-clear sunlight gradually dimmed, and the emerald green leaves were tinged with a hint of sunset.

After hearing the reason for the birth of the curse, the mysterious priest, and the misunderstanding between the Puppet Master and her leader outside Chang'an, Xia Ge's heart beat faster.

As if a reader listening to a boring story, she finally empathized with the story.
As if being there in person, the puppeteer who had lost her mind and slaughtered all the way through was tightly embraced by the puppet who loved her. She said to her:

"Great sin."

"I will atone for you."

......

"What is the ending?" Xia Ge asked.

"The ending is Xia Wushuang giving up everything and choosing to disappear completely." Invincible Puppet said, "According to the rules, that's indeed the case... but, how should I put it, an outstanding person like me can always find a way around the rules."

"I went to the Rule Loophole website before to specifically search for how to evade the eyes of the rules... no, not how to evade taxes, cough, I mean to specifically search for a method to deceive the rules." Xia Ge: "......"

It turns out that the system even has a special area for finding loopholes. No wonder they always trick her so easily.

"Simply put, it's to take one piece of your soul and pretend that you're still in this dimension continuing your mission." The system sounded a bit guilty, "Then send the rest of your soul back to the present world and resurrect you."

"But after I saved you, my energy was exhausted and I couldn't stay in the higher dimensions for long. Also, the flow of time in the third dimension and this dimension is different." Invincible Puppet said, "I can only find a place to hide and wait for the Child of Destiny to appear, so I can restore my strength by attaching to him... Because I made a deal with Gu Peijiu, when the Child of Destiny appears, I will transfer your remaining soul to his opposite... that is, Qin Shuang's body." Invincible Puppet muttered a few times, "That period of time was really terrible..."

The sound of an unknown bird's chirping rang out.

It was getting late, and the tired birds were returning to their nests.

It was very pleasant.

"But you know, this is only a temporary way to deceive the rules. If you really want to stay alive, you still have to complete the mission." The system said.

"What is the ultimate mission I have to complete here?" Xia Ge asked curiously.

The system said, "There are two paths. One is to completely defeat the Heavenly Dao, destroy this world with the highest level of puppetry, and step into the higher dimension on the bones of this world."

Xia Ge: "...... What kind of dream are you dreaming?"

The system's voice quieted down, and even sounded a bit cold, "I'm not dreaming, after all, this world is really just a book."

Xia Ge: "......"

After reacting for a while, Xia Ge suddenly realized, "Wasn't this the path of my original mission?"
The system didn't give a straightforward answer, and seemed to be lost in its own delusions of grandeur, imagining itself with the power to destroy everything with a single hand. "Really, what's there to hesitate about? Either the world perishes or you die. This is just the book - better that I fail the world than the world fail me, don't you understand? Do you have any ambition at all?"

Xia Ge: "......"

System: "Of course, originally the plan was for you to take this path... but when my energy was depleted, I accidentally broke the mission and memory center..."

Xia Ge: "......"

System: "But you're lucky, and thanks to Su Chan, you stumbled upon a second path."

Xia Ge decided to stop thinking about the terrifying possibility that didn't happen and celebrated her luck at having the invincible puppet break its brain...

"The second path?"

System: "Yes, the second path - completely erasing any evidence of your existence, including the 'heavenly condemnation' against you by the heavens, including Evil Spirit Mountain and everything else you've done. In other words, any positive impact caused by you can be ignored, such as the significant increase in the number of puppet masters in this world, which would be very beneficial for the development of the subculture of the universe..."

The system was resolute. "But any negative impact that was previously caused must be eliminated! That is, 'salvation'."

Xia Ge: "..." If she remembered correctly, the reason for the evil spirits was because of puppetry, right?

"Su Chan has already purified all the evil spirits, and the resurrected puppetry will no longer create evil spirits, at most it will be shattered souls, forming clothes and illusions." The system saw through Xia Ge's inner thoughts and explained.

When Xia Ge heard Su Chan's name, she felt a little sad, and changed the subject to ask, "So did you choose the second path for me after breaking your head?"

The system calmly said, "No, I chose to release a neutral mission line."

The neutral mission line meant that both sides of the mission would continue in chaos, and all consequences were possible, but the likelihood of success for both paths was greatly reduced.

After all, you can't save the world while destroying the world, can you?

Xia Ge: "......"

The system quickly said, "But it doesn't matter, after Su Chan becomes a god, your heavenly condemnation and curse will disappear, and the evil spirits will disappear too. All the negative impacts caused by you will no longer exist. I can take advantage of this opportunity to disguise you as someone who has never been to this world before. The law will lose the party of the second part, and it will be judged that the system has made a mistake in releasing the mission."

Upon hearing this, Xia Ge felt a little guilty. "After the mission fails, won't the system be held responsible?"

The invincible puppet sighed deeply. "Yes, because of you, the excellent me will soon be sent to the cosmic labor reform bureau to undergo labor reform... I'm afraid I won't be able to come out for a hundred thousand years..."

Xia Ge decided to forgive all of its mistakes.

System: "Pfft, you actually believed me."
Xia Ge said, "You saved me. I trust anything you say."

The system replied, "..."

Seeing Xia Ge's sincere attitude, Wudi Kui found it hard to continue pretending.

Finally, he hummed, "It's nothing."

But Xia Ge still felt uneasy and said, "Don't force yourself..."

How could it be nothing? He even had to pay for breaking a cup by accident.

Wudi Kui let out a strange laugh like an old fox and said, "I'm really okay. Let me tell you, at the Universal Management Office, I handle fake certificates."

Xia Ge: "..."

The system boasted, "There are so many stupid hosts these days. I have to be prepared for anything. If not, those stupid hosts would have killed me long ago."

Stupid host Xia Ge: "..."

...Forget it. It's all thanks to him for saving her.

After all, she was really stupid before.

The sunset gradually sank.

Xia Ge thought it was time to go back.

She stood up, patted the dust off her clothes, took a few steps, and then stopped.

She thought for a moment and asked, "Why did you have to save me?"

The system had advised Xia Wushuang to let her survive, but at that time, Xia Wushuang was devastated.

Why did the system still take such a big risk to save her?

The system said, "Do you want to die now?"

Xia Ge: "..."

The system said, "You see, it's better to be alive than dead."
It said, "Life is so long, who knows what you'll be thinking in the next moment. Today you want to die, tomorrow you want to live, the day after tomorrow you want to die again."

"Being alive means you can still have a small romance with someone, have a fight and then have a chance to regret it... If you really die, where will you find such a beautiful wife?"

"... All you're talking about is what will happen if I die," Xia Ge was silent for a moment and said, "but you haven't said why you have to save me."

The noisy system suddenly became quiet.

After a while, it said, "Because I promised."

"I am your innate talent."

Wudi puppet said, "I said this to Xia Wushuang too."

The moon was bright and the stars were numerous.

"I guided her into the path of a puppet master - she could always complete tasks excellently, even come up with new and better techniques to spread to the world. At that time, I was very proud in the system world... cough."

"But my existence is to perfect the imperfect puppetry and make them stronger and more perfect under the host's exploration. And to gain corresponding energy points to improve myself."

It spoke, and its voice became slightly smaller, "So when she became interested in the resurrection technique, even though I knew... I didn't deliberately stop her."

"I cannot be considered her innate talent," the system's voice became heavy, "so I chose to save her."

So that's how it is.

The system's voice became playful again, "But now I can also rest assured that you have a family and a wife. Those are all things from your past life, so you definitely don't care anymore, hehehe..."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge was about to say something when she looked up and saw that person standing in the moonlight, quietly looking at her.

Black hair reflected the faint light of the new moon, staring at her, skin as white as snow, and lips gentle.

She raised her hand slightly, and Xia Ge noticed that she was carrying a large bundle of lotus leaves and a big white duck that refused to close its eyes.

Gu Peijiu said, "Let's go home for dinner."

She paused and said again, "Today, we're stewing goose."
After finishing speaking, he turned around and walked a few steps. Feeling that Xia Ge did not follow, he turned his head to look at her.

Under the moonlight, her long and delicate eyelashes cast a shadow on her dark pupils, creating a soft and gentle look.

With just one glance, Xia Ge forgot everything - the frustration, anger, and other negative emotions that had been building up inside her.

One sentence was enough to dispel all of it.

"Where can I find such a beautiful wife?" he said.

For the first time, Xia Ge felt that the system's words made sense.

She walked over, pretending to be angry, and picked up the goose from Gu Peiju's hand without saying a word.

The atmosphere was silent.

Xia Ge couldn't help muttering, "It's still too heavy."

Then, she walked ahead.

Gu Peiju smiled slightly, paused for a moment, and when she saw that Xia Ge didn't follow, she turned around, pretending to be impatient, and said, "Let's go home."

Gu Peiju finally smiled.

The moonlight was pale, and the beauty was like jade, shining through the bones.

Xia Ge was stunned for a moment.

Gu Peiju walked over to her and said softly, "Hmm."

Her voice was soft and carried a hint of a smile.

"Don't think that a duck can make me forgive you," Xia Ge said, carrying the big white goose. She heard her own muffled voice and added, "I still have a probationary period."

The beautiful woman's eyebrows and eyes curved slightly.

"That's a goose," she said.
Summer Song, who was enchanted by beauty, blushed and pretended to be nonchalant, "Oh...a goose."

...whatever goose or duck, they taste the same when stewed.

Anyway, you look good, so for now...whatever you say is right.

The two walked for a while, passing through the dimly lit mountains and forests, and arrived at a large courtyard. The courtyard was built deep in the mountains, with winding corridors, and was the old ancestral home of the Gu family from a long time ago.

This was where they were staying temporarily.

The door wasn't locked.

Summer Song looked at her nose and raised her eyes, "Senior Sister, you didn't lock the door when you left."

Gu Peiju pushed open the door, and the courtyard was cleaned up spotlessly, with an ancient well, a small vegetable garden, and a few persimmon trees, all neatly arranged.

Gu Peiju said slowly, "No one comes to steal."

Little Xiangsi hid on Gu Peiju's shoulder, desperately pointing at either its head or tail.

Summer Song gave a cool glance at Little Xiangsi.

Little Xiangsi quickly slipped behind Gu Peiju's snow-white neck.

Summer Song wouldn't stop until she found something to do, pointing to the empty clothesline pole in the yard and saying, "Senior Sister, your bellyband is missing."

Earlier, to show that she was really angry, Summer Song had tied Little Xiangsi and Senior Sister's bellybands together and hung them on the persimmon tree in the yard as a warning.

This was the main reason why Xiangsi appeared on Gu Peiju's body.

Gu Peiju silently took the big white goose from Summer Song's hand and said warmly, "Good, wait for dinner."

Summer Song: "..."

Senior Sister's back disappeared without any sign of anger.

Summer Song felt like punching cotton.

Summer Song said in confusion, "Why isn't she angry?"

System: "..."
The system was speechless for a moment. "Are you childish or what?"

So many storms had passed, how could she be angry with you over such a small matter?

Not long after, Gu Peijiu came out carrying a whole roasted goose wrapped in lotus leaves.

Although she didn't plan to eat, she was indeed waiting for Xia Ge. "???"

Gu Peijiu said, "We have to bury it underground."

It was probably the same principle as with a beggar's chicken.

The two of them left the house, and this time Gu Peijiu locked the door.

The starry sky was above them as they walked, with Xia Ge breaking the silence. "Senior sister."

Gu Peijiu paused for a moment and made a sound of agreement.

"Next time, don't keep things from me," Xia Ge said at last.

Finally, she said it.

Gu Peijiu thought.

She paused, nodded slightly, and said, "If senior sister doesn't tell me anything...I will feel like an outsider."

As she spoke, Xia Ge lowered her head slightly and looked at the broken leaves and small stones on the ground. "Senior sister always tells me good things or things that make me happy," Xia Ge said. "I am truly happy, but..."

"But I always feel like, even though I'm by senior sister's side, senior sister is still alone."

Before, senior sister was alone, blocking all the loneliness, darkness, pain, and separation. Now, she was bearing the storms and winds alone, but she never thought of giving Xia Ge a little bit of it.

It was like she was a fragile young sprout that couldn't withstand even a little wind and rain.

"I am clearly by your side," Xia Ge said. "I am clearly...clearly by senior sister's side."
This person has a strong yet gentle heart, capable of facing all darkness and injustice alone.

But they always seem to be alone.

"I don't want Senior Sister to be alone," the girl said as she looked up at the stars.

"I don't want to be an outsider to Senior Sister," she continued.

The wind blew, lifting the girl's dark clothes. The moonlight made her bright eyes and fair skin even more beautiful.

Gu Peiju was momentarily lost in thought before she smiled and said, "You're not an outsider."

She whispered, "Xia Xia, you'll never be an outsider to me."

Only this person could walk with her on her path to death.

But she was too cautious.

In the previous life, she protected this person's pride and indulgence. During her lonely five hundred years, she guarded that fragile soul, shielding it from the wind and rain. In this life, she watched her rise and fall, but only wanted to protect her from behind, shielding her from the wind and rain.

Not an outsider, just used to it.

She was used to standing in front of this person as a guardian.

She was so used to it that she didn't even realize she was holding this person's hand, facing the wind and rain together.

"Not an outsider," Xia Ge's heart warmed slightly.

"But Senior Sister never tells me anything," Xia Ge said.

"If you want to know anything, I'll tell you," Gu Peiju replied.

Xia Ge puffed up her cheeks and said, "You always say that, but you still choose to hide things from me."

Gu Peiju thought for a moment, then walked over and took her hand.

Her delicate, warm hand made Xia Ge's bones tremble in the cold night. She lost all ability to resist in an instant.
Gu Peijiu held her hand and led her to an open space, then let go.

Xia Ge clenched and released the hand hidden in her sleeve, cherishing the warmth it left behind. She pretended to be annoyed, but in her heart, she knew that she couldn't let Gu Peijiu off so easily. She had to ask about the things she had experienced before.

Gu Peijiu put the lotus leaf goose aside and then raised her sleeve slightly. With a flash of her sword, she dug a hole in the ground that was just the right size to fit the bulging goose.

Gu Peijiu slowly placed the goose in the hole and buried it, her movements a bit awkward. It seemed like she had never done anything like this before. By the time Xia Ge crouched down to help, Gu Peijiu had already finished burying the goose.

After burying the goose, Gu Peijiu paused and explained to Xia Ge, "I've seen someone do this with a chicken before."

During the years when she was protecting the fragments of her soul, Gu Peijiu had traveled to many places alone.

Xia Ge asked, "A beggar's chicken, right?"

Gu Peijiu nodded.

Xia Ge couldn't help but focus on the details, "I think a goose might be a bit different, like in terms of size?"

Gu Peijiu smiled wryly when she saw Xia Ge's insistence. "I'll go find some firewood."

As Gu Peijiu was about to leave, Xia Ge immediately remembered her small insistence and said, "I'll go with you!"

The system: "..."

Xia Ge followed Gu Peijiu into the mountains to collect firewood, while subtly asking, "Where did you see the beggar's chicken before, Senior Sister?"

Gu Peijiu answered all her questions, "In a small mountain village."

Xia Ge asked again, "Senior Sister..."

Gu Peijiu responded.

Xia Ge asked hesitantly, "Is it... Doudou?"

The wind on the mountain was very light.
Xia Ge held the fragile tree branch in her hand and spoke softly, "Actually, I have seen someone do the beggar chicken thing before."

Gu Peijiu lowered her eyelashes slightly.

It seemed like there was no need to hide anymore.

After a while, she nodded, "Mm."

"Snap."

The tree branch in Xia Ge's hand broke.

She looked at her quietly, "So, the person at the Rain God Temple was you?"

Gu Peijiu looked at her and nodded gently.

"Yes."

The broken branch fell from Xia Ge's hand.

The wind blew over the hill, bringing a sense of cold loneliness.

Xia Ge stiffly turned her back, "...I see."

So it was like that after all.

Gu Peijiu looked at the girl's back and sighed softly. She dropped the tree branch in her hand, walked up to her and hugged her from behind, resting her head on her shoulder and speaking softly.

"Xia Xia."

Xia Ge was like a puppet, not saying anything.

Gu Peijiu called her again, "Xia Xia."

No response.

She paused, then tried to turn her around with a little force, but Xia Ge remained motionless.

Gu Peijiu turned around to see her face but was stunned.

The moon was bright, highlighting the tears on the girl's face.
"She bit her lip, as if she was angry with someone, without even a sob, but the tears couldn't help but roll down in big drops.

- She was crying.

When Gu Peijiu realized this fact, her heart ached.

It felt like the softest part of her was being pricked with needles countless times.

"Whatever you want to hear, I'll tell you." Gu Peijiu heard her own voice, which seemed very calm, even though her brain was already in a panic, and her soul was trembling for her tears, but her voice was still calm as if she was saying that the weather was nice today.

Finally, she hugged the girl's neck, lowered her head and kissed her tearful eyes, trembling eyelashes, soft skin, and finally explored the temperature of her red lips, the salty tears melted on her tongue, and finally entered her mouth, entangled with lips and tongue.

Xia Ge raised her hand and hugged Gu Peijiu's neck tightly, as if she was afraid that she would leave, and kissed her back tightly, suffocatingly.

After the kiss was over, Xia Ge heard her own voice, as calm as before.

"...Gu Peijiu."

"Um."

"Don't leave me like before."

"..."

"You're a bastard."

Gu Peijiu lowered her eyelashes, "Um."

"This life, next life."

The two hugged for a while, and Gu Peijiu wiped Xia Ge's tears.

But no matter how hard she wiped, Xia Ge's eyes were still red, and she held onto Gu Peijiu's clothes tightly, as if she was afraid of losing her.

Gu Peijiu thought for a moment and said, "Don't cry."

"Ugly."

After saying this, she saw the little girl's eyes turn even redder, and thought for a moment before adding a sentence."
"It doesn't matter."

"Even the ugly ones can get married."

Xia Ge: "… It's 'marry'!! You marry!"
