Danfeng, Si Guo Ge.

The morning sunlight filtered through the misty mountains and the windows of Si Guo Ge, lazily spilling onto the pear wood table covered in Xuan paper.

Xia Ge's hand holding the brush trembled slightly.

On the red thread and yellow paper, a hint of ink smudged into a shallow mark, causing Xia Ge immense anguish.

Three thousand times of the Dan Xun!

Three thousand times!

Her glass wood!

How could she be so unlucky...

Xia Ge's heart was twisted like a knife.

So...how did she end up in such a miserable situation?

Xia Ge placed the written Xuan paper on the window sill, looked at the tiny characters on it, and waited for the mountain wind to dry it. Then she returned to the pear wood table, pulled out a new piece of Xuan paper, and continued to copy the thick red book without stopping.

Yes, she was a time traveler.

She was a pitiful girl who, after miraculously surviving from being run over by a car and becoming a vegetable for two years, finally woke up from the hospital thinking she had overcome her hardships and was about to marry a rich and handsome man, only to find herself transmigrated into a beggar in a book a few days later.

The car accident sounded horrific when described vividly by others, but Xia Ge only felt like she had slept under the wheels for a while.

As if she had a terrible dream.

...Although when she woke up in the hospital filled with disinfectant, she looked at the calendar and thought, "Wow, two years have passed."

Xia Ge still admires her own mental strength for being able to accept reality calmly after realizing she had lost two years of her youth.

Admiration, admiration.

Looking at the ink on the first piece of Xuan paper on the window sill, Xia Ge retrieved it, placed it on top of the stack of copied Xuan paper, and then placed the second piece of written characters on top, using a paperweight to press it down. Xia Ge returned to writing the third piece.

Therefore, in summary, she was a scum book transmigrator named Xia Ge, who had been living in this damn world for three or four years and was still a scum supporting character who couldn't even count as a green onion.

Oh, when she first arrived two years ago, she didn't even realize this was a book.
In the real world, she had a younger brother named Xia Wuyin, who was a very reliable younger brother... During the days she was hospitalized, he worked hard to study and earn money to pay for her medical expenses. Their parents had passed away early, leaving behind a considerable inheritance, but she had been the one managing it. So when she passed away... no, when she became a vegetable, her younger brother was left in a difficult situation.

The money was in her hands, and when she had an accident, her younger brother, who had just come of age and didn't really understand anything, had to work everywhere to earn money to take care of his sister who had been in a car accident.

When she finally woke up and was discharged from the hospital and no longer needed her brother's care, her life began to return to normal. Xia Ge couldn't understand how she suddenly ended up in a novel.

After being discharged from the hospital, Xia Wuyin told her not to work and to rest at home. She agreed and became a lazy person at home.

When a person is idle, they tend to find something to pass the time, like reading a novel.

But when she searched her bookshelf, she found that the novels she had collected two years ago, such as "Dou X Continent," "Zhe X," and "Xing Chen X," were all gone...

This made her very angry.

But it didn't matter, since those books were all taken from her brother's bookshelf, and he must have taken them while she was sick.

Xia Ge went to her brother's bookshelf - surprisingly, it was different from before. Now Xia Wuyin's bookshelf was full of serious books such as "Western Economics," "China's Five Thousand Years of History," and "Western Historical Stories."

Indeed, when people experience hardship, they will transform.

Xia Ge was very pleased to see this. She remembered how she had pulled out so many books like "How to Become a Bad X" and "The School X's Personal Protection" from Xia Wuyin's desk in order to be a good sister.

Very good, very good. Indeed, after experiencing the hardships of life, even the most ordinary person can become a pillar of society like her sister!

However, Xia Ge's joy lasted only three seconds.

When she turned around, she saw a thick book on Xia Wuyin's desk, about seven or eight centimeters thick, with enough content to last half a month, and could be used as a brick to hit someone. It was a black book that could be found everywhere on the pirate bookstalls -

"Feng Yue Wu Bian."

Xia Ge: "......"

Retract the previous statement.

...The world is ever-changing, but nature is hard to change. Why was he so different from her as a social pillar?

Reading this kind of book will really twist one's soul!

And it's a pirate copy! This is even more outrageous!

Xia Ge thought hard and decided to read the book in order to better understand the parts of her brother's mind that were corrupted by this pirate book - only then could she prescribe the right medicine!
If time could turn back, if she could cross over again, if...

Xia Ge would definitely, definitely hang Xia Wuyin, who bought pirated books, and beat him a hundred times!

A hundred times!

But Xia Ge, who was then a pillar of society, appeared to be deeply disgusted on the surface, but in fact, happily picked up the book and enjoyed the opium literature.

Although she spoke with righteous indignation, Xia Ge's own bookshelf was filled with male-oriented and upgraded flowery novels confiscated from her younger brother.

Generally speaking, we call them "double standard dogs" gently and kindly on the internet.

At that time, Xia Ge, who was a "double standard dog", did not realize that having double standards was a very excessive thing. She was just regretting the loss of her "essence".

The stallion novels, harem novels, and the too absurd male leads were all thrown in the trash can by her, and only true love remained on her own bookshelf.

However, her true loves were now gone, and she couldn't find any stolen goods in her younger brother's bookcase, so she could only read this opium literature to pass the time.

"The Boundless Wind and Moon", the name was quite romantic, and the content should be good. Her younger brother's taste should be okay...

After reading for a while.

Xia Ge: "......"

Xia Ge closed the book and felt that her younger brother might not only have a serious illness, but also a terminal illness. He was probably beyond cure.

Suffocating.

If it weren't for the doctor's advice, telling her not to touch her phone...

If it weren't for her collection of "essence" being lost...

If it weren't for the boring days of recuperation...

Xia Ge's eyes scanned the pile of "Economics of XX", "Five Thousand Years of Chinese History", and "Practical Economic Law" on the bookshelf...

In the end, her gaze froze on "The Boundless Wind and Moon" in her hand.
Xia Ge: "......"

Her younger brother really has it hard.

Even when reading a novel about a stallion, she still has to see the male lead suffer before he can have a happy ending. Why bother?

Xia Ge thought about what she had read and realized that she had never seen a male lead so oppressed before.

What's even more frustrating is that this is a stallion novel!

Hey, how can all these perfect girls fall for such a useless male lead?

How can the leader of the XX sect see that he has extraordinary talent and potential just by looking at his thin words, while we can only see his endless cowardice?

Even though the male lead is so cowardly, the leader of the XX sect can see that he is down-to-earth and ambitious, which is why he is the leader and she is just a poor victim of a car accident. The difference between people really lies in this one thought, hahaha.

Xia Ge continued to scroll down expressionlessly.

What's wrong with the eyes of all these girls?

Why do they fall for this coward?

Xia Ge gathered her spirits and continued reading.

There were quite a few flaws in the beginning, but the plot was still decent.

It's about a cowardly male lead who lost his family and then joined a sect with the help of the leader's discerning eye and his own token. He became stronger and more confident, and more and more girls fell for him.

It took Xia Ge three or four days to finish reading it.

Why did she finish reading a novel with so many flaws?

Mainly because the male lead became too strong later on, and the overall story was inspirational and not blindly optimistic.

...It's just that there were too many girls who fell for him, which made her feel a little uncomfortable.

Why did all these good girls follow a scumbag?

The author's writing skills were good, and the male lead was initially weak but a bit proud and loyal. He was patient and gentle with the girls.

Later on, he became so strong that even his invisible turtle breath could be felt, and he became so cunning and sinister that he even calculated his opponent's underwear. But on the surface, he still had the gentle and courteous smile of a gentleman.
And it's the kind of gentle smiling face monster of a central air conditioning model.

Then the author naturally starts collecting younger sisters.

The younger sisters all throw themselves at him, saying things like "It's okay, I know you don't like me but it doesn't stop me from liking you." "I just like you!" "It doesn't matter if I die for you, because I love you!" and so on.

The male lead says: "It's all the author's fault for making me collect them!"

Xia Ge: "..."

It's all the author's fault.

Originally, reading this novel was just a way to pass the time. After all, it's all fake and it's already been satisfying, even with the author's forced harem and feeding of X. Even if she's angry, she can only smile and move on.

After all, it's a kind of stallion novel.

Isn't that what stallion novels are like? Just accept it.

But Xia Ge couldn't figure out how she, a pillar of society, could read a stallion novel one day and then end up in one the next day, being fed X by the author.

And she couldn't even enter the male lead's perspective, so it wasn't even satisfying for her.

The smile gradually disappeared from her face.jpg

Can't accept it.jpg

Never reading a stallion novel again.jpg

If her little brother reads one, she'll break his legs.jpg

But as the saying goes, when God closes a door, he opens a window. And if God forgets to open a window, you can always find a dog hole to crawl out of.

When Xia Ge first arrived in this world, she accidentally crossed over into a little beggar's body - unfortunately, when God closed the door, he clearly forgot to open a window for her. After two or three years of begging, God finally remembered to give her a glimmer of hope.

She met the male lead.

Ye★Beggar★Ze★Male Lead

She met the male lead, who was also a beggar from a destroyed family.
Xia Ge: ...

Xia Ge has been begging in this world full of monsters for two years, and finally realized in the third year.

She, Xia Ge, did not travel to a different world, but transmigrated into a book.

The book she transmigrated into was the one she had read before, a stallion novel with endless romance.

And then she met the male lead -

[Ding! Key character encountered, system loading √]

[Ding! Puppet system loaded! Welcome host to the world of the book, Endless Romance -]

No, that's wrong, there is no Endless Romance here, only endless debt, endless begging, endless hunger.

Despair.

"Squeak."

Her thoughts were suddenly interrupted.

The tightly closed wooden door of the Sigu Pavilion was quietly pushed open.

A young man with a stern face came in with a pile of paper, and came to the pearwood table next to her, looking very unhappy.

Xia Ge snapped out of her painful memories and looked hopeless. "Oh, it's Ye Ze."

Yes, this is the male lead of Endless Romance, a scumbag stallion, Ye Ze.
