Outside the green curtain, the sunset was glowing red.

Gu PeiJiu put down her red brush.

Bixi came in, lifting the curtain. "Miss, there are only a few files today. Let's tidy up and rest early."

Gu PeiJiu murmured softly, "Okay."

Bixi smiled while tidying up and chatting, "Miss, it seems like you haven't had any nightmares at night lately?"

Gu PeiJiu rubbed her temples. "It's okay."

Actually, she did have nightmares.

But this time, she could feel herself experiencing something extremely terrifying in her dreams, as if the world was collapsing, her beliefs were crumbling, and everything was in ruins.

However, when she woke up, it was dawn, and she was confused and disoriented. Everything in her dream turned into a bubble, and she couldn't remember anything, except for the feeling of despair and fear that remained in her heart, constantly reminding her of the existence of the nightmare.

The sun was setting in the west.

Suddenly, Gu PeiJiu said, "Bixi."

Bixi responded, "Yes, Miss?"

"Who do you think I am?"

Bixi was slightly stunned, then smiled and said, "Miss is Miss. Who else could she be? Miss is the pillar of Danfeng, the future of Danfeng, and the most outstanding disciple of Lingxi Peak!"

The pillar of Danfeng, the future of Danfeng, and the most outstanding disciple of Lingxi Peak.

"Is that so?"

Gu PeiJiu felt a bit dazed.

...Was she?

Perhaps she was.

...Or perhaps not.

Bixi smiled and said, "Are you too tired these days? I'll tidy up, and you can go soak in the hot spring to recover your energy."
Gu Peijiu unconsciously responded with a "hmm" and by the time she came back to her senses, Bixi had already gone out to prepare.

She opened the drawer under the small table beside her and found a green hair tie with a missing corner lying there. The color was bright and dyed with a light soapberry scent.

Gu Peijiu picked up the green hair tie and wrapped it around her fingertips, quietly staring at it for a long time.

Tianzhuling, which was wrapped around her wrist, quietly crawled out like an elegant red snake and slowly climbed onto the bed, coiling up as if it was going to rest.

Gu Peijiu glanced at it and realized that it was already late. She lit a candle, changed her clothes, and put on a snow-white robe.

Bixi said outside the door, "Miss, I just tried it and the temperature is just right. Come over after changing your clothes."

Gu Peijiu responded with a "hmm" and thought that her mind had been cluttered recently, so it was a good time to rest and sort out her thoughts. She then went over.

While the young lady was soaking in the hot spring, Bixi entered the room and saw Tianzhuling resting on the bed. Without thinking too much, she picked up Tianzhuling and said, "You also need to take a bath."

Tianzhuling was still drowsy and was about to instinctively launch an attack, but then it realized that it was a familiar person of its master, so it relaxed and lazily placed itself down.

Hmm, it also wanted to take a bath.

That small hair tie seemed to have gone to a strange place again.

Hmm...let's talk about it later, let's take a bath first.

- One Sword Shatters the Mountains!

A fierce white light swallowed everything in an instant. The fierce sword aura, with a momentum that covered the sky and the earth, made the bamboo forest tremble as if in fear. Crackling sounds, like firecrackers exploding, echoed everywhere, and wherever the sword aura went, nothing survived!

The injured man in black gritted his teeth and decided to leave while he still had a chance. He suddenly crushed the teleportation stone!

"Boom!"

As the teleportation stone shattered, the man in black disappeared without a trace, but the sword aura had already arrived. With a loud bang, the dazzling sword light instantly crushed the small bamboo house and shattered the paulownia tree behind it. At the top of the sword peak, a snow-white half-moon sword light instantly illuminated the dark sky!

One Sword Shatters the Mountains!

At the critical moment, the red ribbon instantly extended and wrapped around Xia Ge, who was staring blankly and couldn't move, resisting this fatal blow!

System: "Are you stupid?! Move quickly! Run away! Otherwise, how are you going to explain to Chu Yao when she finds you later? You came for sightseeing?!"
Xia Ge's heart was empty, and her eyes were a bit dazed. "I can't move... I feel so uncomfortable."

The system said, "You fool, let me help you. Remember to pay me!"

In the endless white light, the black-clothed person wrapped in a red ribbon instantly turned into a small paper person, protected tightly by the suddenly thin and small ribbon under the sharp sword light.

The dazzling white light faded, and the spiritual energy gradually dissipated, all returning to silence.

Chu Yao stood in place, the mountain wind blowing, her white clothes fluttering. She stepped on wooden clogs, holding a wooden sword in her hand, her eyes shining with a cold light.

"Tsk."

The puppet that was burned to ashes by the fierce sword light fell to the ground with a clatter. She narrowed her light brown eyes slightly.

...Just now, she saw another black-clothed person holding a sickle.

Not a puppet, nor someone who came to steal the key, but more like... someone who came to help.

Seems a bit short.

Glancing at the small bamboo house that she had blasted into pieces with her sword, Chu Yao kicked the mask fragments on the ground casually, her light brown eyes flashing.

So where is that person?

A breeze blew.

"Oh, sister, it's quite lively here."

Chu Yi lightly flicked the ash off her clothes, her almond-shaped eyes filled with a smile, lightly walking out of the bamboo forest, looking harmless.

Chu Yao's eyebrows furrowed instantly. "What are you here for?"

"Me? Of course, I'm here to help sister." Chu Yi played with the dagger in her hand, laughing lightly. "Thanks to sister's sword, I was able to come so quickly."

"The spy has already left," Chu Yao said expressionlessly. "You can go back now."

Chu Yi chuckled softly. "Don't be like this, sister. I came specifically to help."

Chu Yao sneered. "Help? Or just here to watch the show?"
Chu Yao played with the dagger, squinting her eyes. "Let's combine the two."

Xia Ge didn't notice Chu Yi's arrival and remained motionless as a paper doll controlled by the system, lying on the ground like a salted fish.

The system said, "You're really stupid."

Xia Ge replied, "Let me be quiet for a moment..."

In the distance, there was a bustling sound. Xia Ge vaguely felt that something was wrong. "Is it the escort team?"

The system replied, "It seems like it...?"

Before Xia Ge could react, a huge boot stomped down. "Lord Chu!!!"

"I'm sorry for being late!!"

From the first foot onwards, countless boots trampled mercilessly on the paper doll, making a mess of it. "Ah, Lord Chu, I'm sorry! Are you hurt?!!"

"... "

Xia Ge, who was trying to flip over but kept being trampled into the mud, said, "..."

The system asked, "Have you calmed down yet?"

Xia Ge gave up trying to flip over, lying in the mud like a dry piece of paper, with empty eyes. "Ah, this is life."

The system replied, "..." Let's assume you've calmed down.

"Lord Chu!"

"... "

Chu Yi raised an eyebrow. "Is this your sister's escort team? Why do they all act like useless people?"

Chu Yao said, "It's none of your business."

After speaking, she ignored Chu Yi and lazily began to look for clues at the scene.

The first thing she saw was not anything else, but the smashed and messy persimmon.

Chu Yao looked at the persimmon pulp and fell into deep thought.
Height is short, likes to eat, and came to Jianfeng to steal persimmons.

... Why does that sound like someone I know?

The guard team rushed over in a hurry, and Li Liu was the fastest and the first to arrive. He had an anxious look on his face. "Lord Chu, are you okay?"

His voice stuttered slightly as he looked at the puppet fragments scattered all over the ground and the small bamboo house that had been reduced to rubble by the violent impact. He was so shocked that he couldn't speak for a while.

Ye Ze walked at the back of the guard team. He had not taken many steps when he suddenly felt something hard under his foot. He was slightly startled and looked down. His pupils shrank to a point.

A piece of dragon jade with a missing corner, extremely familiar, lay quietly on the ground.

... Xia Wuyin's jade pendant?!

Xia Wuyin?! Why would Xia Wuyin's jade pendant be here?

He immediately picked up the jade pendant and held it in his hand, rubbing his fingers over the patterns. He became even more certain.

This was Xia Wuyin's jade!

When he realized what this jade meant at this moment, his whole body suddenly stiffened in place, his mind blank.

Chang Nian saw that he was not moving. "What are you doing? ... Hey, what's in your hand?"

Ye Ze immediately came back to his senses and reacted almost instantly. "This is mine."

"I didn't ask whose it was! You say it's yours, so it's yours?" Chang Nian sneered. "Your attitude is suspicious! Could it be that you picked it up?"

He raised his eyebrows and said maliciously, "Maybe you're a spy! Are you deliberately covering for the spy, Ye Ze? I can see through you!"

"This is mine," Ye Ze's face was as calm as water, his voice heavy.

No one noticed that not far away, a paper person wrapped in a thin red ribbon and covered in mud was hiding behind a clump of weeds, secretly observing.

System: "... Can you handle this?"

Xia Ge: "Success or failure depends on this one move."

System: "What if he suspects you're a spy?"

Xia Ge said confidently, "But I'm not."
The system suddenly reminded, "You were just stepped on by a dozen people."

Xia Ge: "Shut up."

System: "Actually, I did it on purpose."

Xia Ge: "..."

Ye Zechang listened to their argument and noticed that others had also paid attention. Chu Yao was focused on studying the burnt persimmon, while Chu Yi walked over, playing with a dagger in her hand. Her almond-shaped eyes half-closed lazily under her long eyelashes as she asked, "What are you guys arguing about?"

As soon as he saw Chu Yi, Chang Nian became more confident. He sneered and pointed at Ye Zechang, "I suspect he picked up something from the spy!"

Chang Nian paused for a moment and then continued more viciously, "No, I suspect he is in collusion with the spy!"

Chu Yi raised her eyes and saw the young man standing tall with a corner missing from his dragon jade, shining in the moonlight. He looked at her with starry eyes and spoke slowly, "This is mine."

In the bright moonlight, the missing corner of the dragon jade was the same as the countless times she had dreamed of it at midnight.

The meteor blade in her hand suddenly fell to the ground with a clatter.

The sound of the jade sheath shattering on the stone was as crisp as a dream.

In an instant, countless dreams and illusions were nothing compared to the moonlight and the young man before her.

Chu Yi murmured, her voice trembling, "You are... Aze?"

Ye Zechang was stunned holding the jade.

The sound of the meteor blade falling to the ground alarmed many people. The guards were curious and looked over. Chang Nian felt something was wrong with Chu Yi's state and frowned slightly, "Yi Yi?"

Why did Chu Yi call Ye Zechang Aze?

Chu Yi suddenly came back to her senses and quickly stabilized her expression. "It's nothing, it's nothing."

As she spoke, she picked up the meteor blade from the ground. Even though her face was calm, her hand that picked up the dagger under her wide sleeve was still trembling. She picked it up several times, but it fell down again. Under everyone's gaze, Chu Yi's face turned frighteningly red. For a moment, her mind was in chaos. Sometimes it was the clear wind and bright moonlight of the young man, sometimes it was the broken jade sheath of the dagger in front of her, and sometimes it was the dragon jade with a missing corner that she had secretly placed on the man's body. 

It was all so inexplicable.
Suddenly, everything went dark before Chu Yi's eyes. The shattered jade, falling stars, and the young man all disappeared like a bubble.

Chu Yi's whole body stiffened.

...It happened again. She couldn't see anything.

- She couldn't see anything at all.

Where was the jade, or rather, the falling star blade? She had to find it quickly! There were so many people around, someone might find it!

...The second young miss of the Chu family was blind? What a joke! How could this happen?

As she grew more and more panicked and started to grab blindly, someone grabbed her wrist. "...Don't move, you've got the shattered jade."

The falling star blade was quietly picked up and then placed gently in her hand by the person holding her wrist.

The young man's voice was low. "...Hold it tight."

The falling star blade still carried the warmth of the other person.

As if infected by something, the darkness in front of her gradually dissipated, and she looked up in a daze, holding the falling star blade. In her jet-black pupils, she saw the young man's face.

She could see again.

Suddenly, she could see again.

Why? Whenever she had an attack before, it was impossible for her to recover in just an hour...why?

Chu Yi held the falling star blade and shook off his hand, stood up, stepped back three steps, and looked at the people below, feeling a little stiff.

Ye Ze stood up, his expression calm. He looked at her and then took out the jade in his hand and showed it to her. He repeated seriously, "This is mine."

Chang Nian's face turned a little green. "Who allowed you to touch the second young miss?!"

Ye Ze didn't even look at him.

Chu Yi closed her eyes for a moment, then smiled lightly, as she usually did. She opened her eyes and looked at him. "Um...thank you. What's your name?"

- He probably doesn't remember her anymore.

Ye Ze paused. "...Ye Ze."
Ye Ze... Aze, Longyu.

It's hers, Aze... her brother.

Chu Yi lowered her eyebrows, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips, but her eyes were deep.

"It's yours."

The right horn of the jade dragon on her chest emitted a scorching heat, resonating with its original body.

It was his ghost dragon jade.

It was her Aze.

Chang Nian widened his eyes, somewhat incredulous. "Yi Yi sister..."

"Chang gege, it's just a piece of jade. Why bother making a fuss?" Chu Yi smiled lightly at Chang Nian, carefree and relaxed. "I've seen this jade on this gege before, so don't worry about it anymore."

Chang Nian: "..."

Chu Yi had no idea who Ye Ze was before this, at most knowing that a poor guy came from Danfeng. How could she have seen the jade on Ye Ze before?

She was just giving Ye Ze a way out!

Xia Ge crouched behind the grass, watching the whole process.

The system was unsure: "Is this... considered a success?"

Xia Ge: "Hmm, it is."

After a pause, Xia Ge firmly said, "One stone, three birds."

In fact, it took her several months to spy on traitors, drink with Chu Yao, and be a troublemaker at Jianfeng... no, an assistant. She had three main goals.

Leave the ghost dragon jade to Ye Ze, let Ye Ze and Chu Yi recognize each other, and then... let Chu Yi's eyes return to normal.

She couldn't find a reason to see Ye Ze, and Ye Ze was also awkward, wanting to return the jade to him. This was the only bad idea she could come up with.

As for Chu Yi...

The system: "I thought you didn't recognize her. You really don't care about her, do you?"
Translation:

Xia Ge: "Ah, we still need to keep an eye on her... Is she really useful to us? It's not beneficial to anyone."

Tianmu grass can restore the sight of the blind, but in the later stages, it needs to be near the child of destiny to maintain its effectiveness.

She is not the child of destiny.

The child of destiny is the protagonist of this book, Ye Ze.

Only Chu Yi staying by his side can keep his eyes healthy.

And... with the protection of Chu Yi's identity, no one should bully Ye Ze again.

Kill three birds with one stone, although it's a bit hard, why not do it?

"Ah, I'm really like Lei Feng," Xia Ge sighed, "Why doesn't anyone give me an award?"

System: "... Don't be too happy too soon. Where does your confidence come from? Won't Chu Yi notice that something's wrong? Ye Ze doesn't know anything at all."

Xia Ge: "Ah, take a look at her now."

The system then looked at Chu Yi.

Although Chu Yi's face remained unchanged, with a faint smile, it was obvious that she didn't dare to even look at Ye Ze.

Xia Ge: "What did you see in her eyes?"

System: "..." Nervous, nervous, nervous.

It seems a bit cowardly.

Xia Ge calculated with her fingers and said confidently, "I can see that with the way she is now, she shouldn't notice anything wrong for at least ten days or half a month."

System: "..."

Xia Ge: "Anyway, when she does notice something wrong, Ye Ze won't be as cowardly as he is now, and besides..."

Chu Yi is so smart that even if she feels that something is wrong at that time, she should be able to realize that her eyes won't go wrong when she's close to Ye Ze.

She's not stupid. She should know what to do when the time comes without being taught.

The system paused, "... So what do you do now?"
Summer, Little Paper Man, sang deeply, "When the matter is settled, brush off your clothes and leave, hiding your achievements and fame."

"Go and wake everyone up for me." Summer's flute playing had not lasted long before she heard Chu Yao's voice coming through. It seemed that she had finished studying the rotten persimmons. "From now on, the entire Sword Peak is under martial law. Not even a mosquito is allowed to fly out!"

"You go find Senior Chang. Dan Peak and Beast Peak must not be left out. Let him immediately issue the Lingxi Order."

After speaking to Li Liu, Chu Yao paused. "The entire peak is under martial law. Start investigating now and find all those disciples who didn't return at night!"

Summer was startled. "What the hell?"

The system said, "Hurry back!"

Summer tried to make herself float, but despairingly found herself covered in mud and unable to move.

The system said, "..."

Summer said, "How come I never realized that you were such a drag before?"

The system said, "You were in a bad state just now. I just wanted you to recover quickly."

Summer said, "Why don't you materialize? When you pass out, I'll throw you down and let people step on you. You'll fall quickly."

The system said, "..."

The red ribbon on her body suddenly trembled, and the system quickly realized, "Have you given it a name?"

Summer said, "Little Red."

"Okay, shut up." The system paused. "Whatever it is, give it a name."

Summer said, "I said Little Red... Naming is a responsibility."

The system said, "..."

The system sneered, "When you're caught for not returning at night tomorrow, you won't have to worry about taking responsibility."

Summer looked at the dirty red ribbon that was entwined gently around her fragile paper body, protecting her securely.

But... why was it willing to protect her like this?

It was a sentient clothing demon, and it had no ties to her. Why was it so willing to lend her its power, even if it meant being trampled in the mud with her?
Three years.

    ……

    夏歌被这个梦境深深震撼了，她不知道这是什么，但是她感觉到了一股强烈的力量，这股力量似乎在告诉她什么，但是她还没有领悟到。

    “这是什么？”夏歌问着红丝带。

    红丝带没有回答，只是静静地飘动着，似乎在等待着什么。

    夏歌又问了一遍，但是还是没有得到回答。

    她环视四周，发现自己已经回到了现实中，这个梦境已经结束了。

    但是，那个少女的身影，却一直在她的脑海中挥之不去。
Three years...

Many, many years.

The passage of time was too fast, Xia Ge couldn't count how many years had passed.

Finally, one year, with autumn leaves falling all over the forest, the bloodline had grown so long and dense that it had materialized completely around the young girl, no longer just an illusion, but like an unbreakable yearning.

Xia Ge wanted to step forward, to make her turn around, to ask who she was. But before she could take a step, the sky suddenly changed, clouds gathered!

The girl seemed to sense something, and the entwined bloodline instantly condensed. There was a terrifying rumble from the mountain, and her blood-stained white clothes fluttered in the wind!

Xia Ge widened her eyes, "Hey--"

The girl didn't turn around, and with a thunderous roar, the condensed bloodline suddenly dispersed, blocking the thunderbolt that was about to strike her.

"Boom--"

The attack missed, and the lightning struck the unnamed tombstone!

This seemed to instantly anger her, and the blood threads suddenly condensed, thick and intertwined, rushing towards the sky!

"If heaven punishes me," the girl's voice was ethereal, "then I will, slay heaven."

"Boom--"

The blood threads surged endlessly, rushing to the nine heavens, entangled with the thunder!

"...May you gather many flowers," amidst the lightning and thunder, the barefoot girl's back was facing her, her voice faint and soft, with a few remaining blood threads gently entwined around the tombstone, guarding its peace.

"This thing, is the most lovesick."
