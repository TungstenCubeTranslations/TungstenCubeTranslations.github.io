The surging ghost tide.

If at the beginning people were able to cope with the ghost tide, now it is completely overwhelming. They slip through every crack and crevice, and those who are exhausted from dealing with them are on the brink of collapse.

"Why are there still more?!"

"It seems... there are even more now!"

"..."

The evil spirits have multiplied.

Heart-wrenching screams and the pungent smell of blood on the nose all indicate something ominous.

"Awoo-"

Xia Ge threw down her sickle, drew a barrier, and used the power of soul suppression to temporarily keep the evil spirits outside the barrier.

However, since earlier, the power of soul suppression had been unstable, as if it had encountered something unsettling.

But Xia Ge didn't have the energy to pay attention to so many details. The materials lacking for the Ten Thousand Soul Pill could all be bought at a high price from the system store, but the most important material, ten thousand souls, was what made Xia Ge feel a little headache.

Certainly, there were many evil spirits outside, but...

She couldn't run out and say, "Hey, you guys come here, I want to refine pills," and even if she did, they wouldn't obediently jump into the furnace for her to refine!

Looking at the pile of materials in her hand, everything was there, but the points she had accumulated over the past three years were quickly spent.

After all, although the system store had everything, it was also expensive. Xia Ge rarely bought anything from there, and instead looked for everything she could find in the black market. But now she didn't have time to slowly collect materials, so she could only do this.

But now that the materials were complete, what should she do with the souls of the evil spirits?

"..."

For the first time, Xia Ge felt somewhat helpless.

She looked at the pill recipe, the materials and method written very clearly, and the pill formula was also very clear, everything was clear...

"All evil spirits must be gathered together..."
Xia Ge slightly tightened the scroll in her hand.

She walked up to Gu Peijiu.

Gu Peijiu's eyes were closed, her black hair gently draped over her shoulders, accentuating her long eyelashes and her snow-white skin.

She looked peaceful, as if she would never open her eyes again.

For a moment, Xia Ge began to fear death.

Not because she had promised someone that she "couldn't die," but because of a genuine, deep-seated fear of death from the bottom of her heart.

"...... Xiao Kui."

Xia Ge murmured, "What... what is it like after someone dies?"

Xiao Kui was also uncertain. "It's probably... like that thing you saw over there last time, like Dou Dou."

Everything was forgotten, except for a single obsession.

"I see." Xia Ge squatted down and gently held Gu Peijiu's right hand.

Her senior sister's warm hand now felt slightly cold.

Xia Ge couldn't remember how many times she had held this hand over the years, walking through the embroidered ball flowers that bloomed on Dan Feng, and the endless mountain paths filled with white flowers.

Her hand slowly moved up, brushing past the Tianzhu silk, and finally fell on the slightly rough fabric that was compared to the Tianzhu silk.

Xia Ge saw its true appearance.

It was a green hairband with a missing corner.

After Xia Ge developed lovesickness, she couldn't find her old green hairband anymore. Because it wasn't very important, she never bothered to look for it.

She had also thought that maybe it was left with her senior sister.

But...

She had never thought that...

A seemingly insignificant green hairband, would be treasured by her and worn on her body.
Just like her unremarkable appearance, for the past three years she had been cradled in her embrace, and this hairband had never experienced any storms like this before.

As someone who had survived through hardship, she almost forgot what it felt like to be wronged.

Warm tears flowed down her cheeks in an instant.

Xia Ge closed her eyes, holding onto Gu Peijiu's hand, her heart soft and aching.

What does it mean to love someone?

Perhaps it means having both vulnerabilities and armor.

Xia Ge felt like she was no longer afraid of anything.

"Xiao Kui," Xia Ge murmured to herself, "why are people so strange?"

She bought a pill from the store and swallowed it, then used the soul-sealing scythe to draw a circle around Gu Peijiu.

Then she slowly untied the soul-sealing belt.

System: "Host, you..."

When a person truly and firmly wants to take off their demonic clothes, the clothes can make a choice.

To refuse, or to obey.

The girl slowly took off her black clothes, the flowing water, her snow-white body incredibly soft. She put on a simple night robe, folded the soul-sealing scythe and placed it next to Gu Peijiu.

The power of the circle did not disappear with Xia Ge taking off her demonic clothes, but instead became stronger as it got closer to the soul-sealing scythe.

Taking off the soul-sealing scythe, Xia Ge felt very heavy, as if a mortal who had ascended to immortality had suddenly fallen back to earth, dropping a whole level.

System: "...What do you want to do?"

However, she ignored the system's words and did not answer. She just squatted down and spoke softly to the soul-sealing scythe.

"From now on, I can give you anything you want."

The soul-sealing scythe remained silent next to Gu Peijiu.

"So, senior sister, I beg you."
At the next moment, the cloud-patterned sickle suddenly lifted from one side and cut a deep mark between Xia Ge and Zhen Hun on the cold land.

The dust raised by the sickle fell on Xia Ge's mask.

She stared at Zhen Hun without flinching.

As a "contracted" Yimei, Xia Ge could clearly sense Zhen Hun's emotions.

--Anger.

It was angry.

For a weaker person to take off their Yimei and go to their death, it was an insult to it.

--But it agreed.

It chose to obey, whether to refuse or submit.

Perhaps this was the best answer.

Xia Ge lowered her eyes, "I know you said that the weak have no say."

"I am not strong enough."

Xia Ge touched her chest and whispered, "But... I don't want even my own heart to be weak."

Zhen Hun remained motionless.

"If you don't have strong power," Xia Ge said, "then you must have a brave soul."

"You're talking nonsense." The system said, "Being sure is called bravery, being unsure is called foolishness."

"I know."

Xia Ge stood up, "So I'm really not a smart person."

The system suddenly had a bad feeling: "...What are you going to do?"

"I know what a ground-level alchemist looks like." Xia Ge didn't answer, just looked outside the circle. She drew two circles, one was a large circle to protect her and Gu Peijiu, and the other was a small circle to completely protect Gu Peijiu, with Zhen Hun protecting them.

And now, outside the circle, countless evil spirits were coveting her, but they didn't dare to step in.
She held the materials in her arms, wearing a simple night robe and a mask, step by step walking towards outside the circle, "True alchemists at the earth level, use the sky as a cover and the earth as a furnace."

She was only one step away from being an earth-level alchemist.

However, this step was like an insurmountable gap.

It required opportunity and great fortune.

She was not Ye Ze, she did not have that kind of fortune, and she did not care whether she could cross it or not.

Xia Ge had never been interested in crossing it, because she always felt that in this world, there might not be anyone who could make her risk her life to cross this level gap.

True earth-level alchemists, in addition to having impeccable alchemy skills, also need to have a fearless and tough soul that can accept the washing of the heavens and understand the changes of the heavens. They use the sky as a cover and the earth as a furnace, borrowing the power of the heavens and the earth to transform the earth-level divine pill.

- Why can humans be so strange?

Clearly, she was so scared of ghosts before.

Before she had the power of the town soul, she could treat ghosts like tofu and cabbage, but now without the power of the town soul, she stood here and didn't feel afraid.

Xia Ge thought, this is really... too strange.

- She didn't have the luck to turn decay into magic.

But she could have the courage to face pain and ghosts for someone.

Xia Ge always believed that brave and smiling people would not be too unlucky.

System: "Are you crazy?! Go back quickly!! Don't go any further! If you fail-"

"If we fail, let's die together." Xia Ge bit her finger, "Xiao Kui, to be honest, it's been nice knowing you."

System: "......"

The bright red blood flowed from her fingertips, but Xia Ge didn't feel any pain.

Even though she felt so painful when she was applying the red talisman before, but now she didn't feel any pain.

Even if there was no one to comfort her, she didn't feel wronged at all.

The ghosts outside the circle had red eyes.
They could clearly feel the huge spiritual energy contained in the blood.

Xia Ge had opened her spiritual orifices and as a priestess, she had naturally strong spiritual power. For evil spirits, she was like the most delicious pastry.

The barefooted girl held medicinal herbs and her black hair was loose as she stepped out of the circle.

"Roar!"

In an instant, the evil spirits outside the circle rushed towards Xia Ge as if they had seen a fresh pastry that had flown into their mouths. Their saliva flowed all over the ground.

"Eh... not now."

Xia Ge quickly dodged and moved away from the two circles.

-She couldn't let her senior sister see her in such a state.

She was too embarrassed.

Because she had no great luck, the fastest way for her to become a ground-level pill master was to undergo "Phoenix Nirvana".

-Reduced to ashes and reborn.

She stopped on a hill and turned around, and the evil spirits swarmed towards her like a beehive!

Xia Ge laughed loudly, "Is that all you've got?"

"Come on!"

The claws of the evil spirits tore through flesh!

Xia Ge did not move, but suddenly changed the hand seal.

"Roar!"

At the moment when the flesh was torn apart, countless evil spirits came one after another. People who were fighting the evil spirits were shocked to see that all the evil spirits had stopped moving. They were like wolves that had smelled even more delicious flesh and one by one, they showed their sharp teeth and ran towards a direction!

"What's going on?"

"I don't know... but at least we can breathe a sigh of relief now!"

"This is really troublesome..."
"I can't believe it, Xia Zhangling is actually a puppet master..."

"Don't say it! I must kill him!!"

"..."

System: "Are you crazy?! You will die!!"

It was very painful.

Haunted by demons, tearing flesh, colliding souls.

But she won't die.

The medicine she bought from the system store before was "Infinite Regeneration".

No matter how her body is torn apart, even if it's completely shattered, it will regenerate infinitely within three days.

Except for a little pain, there's nothing else.

But slowly, the pain disappeared.

Xia Ge couldn't hear anything anymore, her soul began to wander, floating far away, looking at the body below that was being torn apart.

The more ethereal she became, the more she could feel her heart.

True earth level, no matter what kind of earth level it is.

It doesn't require a physical body, it is a transcendent existence.

She felt the operation of the heavenly dao, the changes in the world, transcended her own heart, the reason for the existence of this world, and the only obsession that made her return.

This obsession was like a kite string, allowing her to comprehend the mysteries of the earth level while not losing herself.

Xia Ge knew exactly what she wanted.

The fleeting soul combined with the heavenly dao, in an instant, everything became pure and clear.

She could see everything she couldn't see before.

Feeding the demon with her body, just to seek perfection.
"You will die!" 

Xia Ge looked at the increasing number of evil spirits, and the ghosts all over the mountains seemed to be attracted by this body. They found that the smell of blood was like poison, irresistible. 

But this person seemed to never be eaten, as if bitten on one side, it would immediately grow on the other side. 

The evil spirits felt excited. 

Xia Ge heard her reply to the system. 

"I won't." 

Following the changes of the heavenly path, Xia Ge's soul pinched the elixir! 

In an instant! 

All the actions of the evil spirits stopped!
