Later on... What happened?

I don't remember.

The wide red silk seemed to sense the owner's mood and spread its restlessness, spreading all the way to the doorstep of a wooden door, as if something was attracting it. It cautiously rubbed against the door.

Gu Peijiu paused slightly, but a sentence inexplicably popped up in her mind.

-- No matter what.

-- I want to be the person you like.

She closed her eyes, and cold sweat appeared on her forehead.

What is she...?

In the room, Xia Ge, who had no idea what was happening outside, felt weak all over and her heart was beating hard. She held a teleportation stone in her hand, ready to escape at the first sign of trouble.

However, as the person in the tomb, Achan, had said, no one knew where this unreliable teleportation stone of Lingxi Old Ancestor would send her. Plus, in her current inexplicable state, she didn't plan to use it until the last moment.

However, after waiting for a long time, the door that should have been kicked open remained silent, and there was no sound outside.

...What happened?

Why hasn't that big-headed man come yet?

Xia Ge touched the sickle in the quilt and thought for a moment, then decided to go down and check the situation.

However, just as she lifted the curtain and smelled the fragrance outside the bed, her head buzzed, and she immediately felt dizzy.

Not good! Her lust addiction was triggered by the fragrance outside!

Xia Ge tried to maintain the last bit of her sanity, pulled her head back inside, closed the bed curtain tightly, and felt her body softening and swelling all over. She felt that this state would lead to her death no matter where she went, so she decisively put the teleportation stone back into the Flowing Silver Ring.

Xia Ge took a deep breath, and her mind slowly became blurred.

Oh my god, it's so hot...

However, at this moment...

Outside the door, Gu Peijiu slowly let go of her hand. She looked at Tian Zhuling, who was quietly knocking on the door, and saw that the door was not locked, so she pushed it open a crack.
With a single thought, the door silently opened.

Gu Peijiu stepped inside, taking one step at a time.

A strong, strange scent filled the air, but it had no effect on her. She glanced at it, and in an instant, Tianzhuling reacted and shattered the incense burner that burned with the desire for pleasure.

The jarring sound didn't even snap the person lying on the bed out of their stupor. Xia Ge had completely lost her mind, her head filled with thoughts of finding something cool to lean against and rub against.

Gu Peijiu walked to the side of the bed, her eyes lowered, her soft black hair falling down. She slowly lifted the white bed curtain.

But as soon as she lifted it a little, her wrist was suddenly grabbed. Gu Peijiu's pupils shrank, and before she could react, the person on the bed pulled her inside with great boldness!

The bed curtain moved slightly, and the hand with the red ribbon tightly held onto her wrist. The girl in the red dress with a red veil draped over her was pressed against her, tightly, like a fish stranded on the shore. She murmured, "Hot... hot..."

Gu Peijiu was pressed down by the person, her back hitting a hard object. Her breath suddenly tightened, and Tianzhuling was almost activated in an instant, ready to pierce the person's head. However, as Tianzhuling was about to touch the person, the thin red ribbon wrapped around the girl's left hand suddenly shot out, turning into a wide silk net that separated the girl and the Tianzhuling. The girl fought against Tianzhuling fiercely, while also carefully protecting the person under her.

For a moment, Gu Peijiu looked at the familiar red ribbon wrapped around the girl's hand and felt even more confused. She pressed her temples, trying to suppress the chaotic memories that were flooding back. "Who are you?" she asked, feeling foolish as soon as the words left her mouth.

The red ribbon that protected the master was here, so who else could she be looking for but her?

"I don't know, I don't know..." Xia Ge's mind was in chaos. Her hands were fumbling around, and she didn't even know what she was saying. She just knew that she was really uncomfortable.

Suddenly, she touched a soft spot, and Gu Peijiu's eyes widened slightly. She grabbed the hand that was groping around, gritting her teeth. "Stop."

"I'm uncomfortable..." The girl's voice was whiny, "Wuwuwu... I'm going to die."

A familiar yet unfamiliar voice.

Familiar because the person always spoke in a deliberately low voice, unfamiliar because the voice was tinged with the coquettishness of a young girl.

Gu Peijiu didn't say anything. She used one hand to restrain the girl's hands and used the other to remove the girl's red veil.

Soft black hair fell down slightly messy, and under the removed red veil, the girl's eyebrows and eyes were picturesque, her cheeks like peach blossoms in March, her lips soft and scarlet, exquisitely beautiful and unrivaled in the world.

Gu Peijiu's pupils suddenly shrank as she looked at the face that was familiar yet unfamiliar. She felt her heart being struck heavily, and for a moment, her mind went blank.
...It's not you who's going to die.

It's her who's going to die, right?

The young girl sobbed, "I feel uncomfortable."

Gu Peijiu heard her own unsteady voice and said, "Bear with it!"

"I can't, I can't..."

Xia Ge didn't listen and twisted around on the bed. Gu Peijiu's mind was in chaos, with fragments of memories she couldn't identify and her own remaining sanity colliding. She gritted her teeth and flipped over, pressing the struggling girl under her!

Xia Ge was poked by the sickle she had put in the blanket and started struggling again, "Uncomfortable, uncomfortable..."

Gu Peijiu sneered and patted her face, "I was uncomfortable just now too."

There seemed to be some iron tool in the blanket that was making it uncomfortable. It was probably something this little brat had prepared for self-defense, but she didn't expect to be affected by the aphrodisiac.

The smell of fresh blood filled the air. Gu Peijiu paused, slowly reached out her hand, and touched the girl. She narrowed her eyes for a moment.

She sneered and patted her face, "Disguised as a man?"

In her mind, she was on the Yun Du female wall in her dream, and the girl was barefoot, smiling at her.

Gu Peijiu's hand holding hers tightened.

Xia Ge had no reason left, her cheeks were red, and she blinked at her with a pitiful look, saying she was hot.

Then she twisted her body, "Uncomfortable, uncomfortable."

Gu Peijiu said, "...Bear with it."

Xia Ge didn't want to, "I won't."

After speaking, she tried to pull her clothes, "Cool, cool."

Gu Peijiu's face turned dark. She held her hand and suddenly rolled up the Tianzhu silk, tightly tying the hand Xia Ge had been touching everything with. "Take off your own clothes if you're hot."

The girl in the red dress didn't speak anymore. Her mouth flattened, her black hair was messy, and she lay on the bed with her hands tied up. She looked at her pitifully, her eyes as black as if they could speak.

Gu Peijiu's mind was in chaos again-
"It's not like that... that person."

"No, it's not her."

She came to her senses and reached out behind the girl. The girl's eyes were watery and she rubbed her back against her hand, saying, "It feels good."

Gu Peijiu said, "...calm down."

After speaking, she lifted the silk quilt under the girl and pulled out a shiny black scythe with one hand.

The blade was sharp enough to cut a hair.

Gu Peijiu held the scythe and was about to say something when the girl suddenly twitched like a carp and her lips suddenly felt warm. She looked at the face in front of her and her pupils shrank suddenly.

The girl's lips were rosy with a hint of sweet rose fragrance. From Gu Peijiu's angle, she could clearly see the girl's long and curled eyelashes and her black and innocent eyes. She kissed her absentmindedly and then rubbed her face against hers. Gu Peijiu was frozen by this sudden kiss, and the scythe in her hand slipped silently and fell back onto the bed. The powder on the girl's cheek rubbed off on hers, and finally, seeming tired, the girl rested her head on Gu Peijiu's shoulder.

Gu Peijiu slowly lifted her hand and helped the girl up, letting her lean against her. Xia Ge was obedient, leaning forward against her with a rosy complexion and a dazed look.

"You are my destiny."

"My everything."

Gu Peijiu heard the girl whispering in her ear, "I want..."

Gu Peijiu didn't say anything. She was wearing a cloak and her white hand brushed the girl's slightly messy black hair. Her butterfly-like eyelashes trembled slightly as she moved her fingers. The sky-killing thread loosened and the red ribbon that the girl had wrapped around her own left hand quietly slipped off and wrapped around Gu Peijiu's fingertips. 

She held her and let her lean against her shoulder. Her white hand, wrapped in the red ribbon, stroked the girl's black hair, her voice low and hoarse.

"...what do you want?"

"No matter what you want, even if it means breaking mountains and rivers, I will offer it to you."

The girl was confused and murmured for a long time, seeming to not know what she wanted.
Gu Peijiu gathered her soft long hair and tied it up with a red ribbon that was wrapped around her fingers. The soft red ribbon tied up her shiny black hair, making it no longer messy and revealing her delicate ears and fair neck.

Her heart was beating fast as she closed her eyes and asked again, "What do you want?"

The young girl was confused, hesitant, and indecisive for a long time. So long that Gu Peijiu thought there would be no answer.

"I want to go home," the girl leaned against her shoulder, her voice faint, with an unattainable expectation. "I want to go home..."

Gu Peijiu paused slightly. "Where is your home?"

"I can't go back..." The fabric on her shoulder was slightly damp, and the girl's voice was choked with tears. She twisted and pulled at the Tianzhu silk bound around her hands, "It hurts, it hurts!"

The addiction to pleasure had taken hold!

Gu Peijiu raised her hand and pressed the girl back onto the bed, her voice turning cold. "Stay sober!"

"I'm in pain..." She struggled, but Gu Peijiu took a deep breath and restrained her. Suddenly, she heard footsteps and loud voices outside the door.

"What's going on?"

"What's wrong?"

"Quick, call someone!"

The people who came to collect the auction items had arrived!

Gu Peijiu hadn't recovered yet when she suddenly felt a warm sensation on her cold cheek. With a "smack," a bright red lip print was left on her left cheek. The culprit looked confused, "Hmm, it's cool."

Gu Peijiu: "..."

"Someone must have come! Quickly check if there are any missing items!"

"..."
Outside the door, the noise was even louder, and there were faint sounds of people approaching. The person below hugged her for a while, but then started acting up again, twisting like a caterpillar, not knowing what she wanted, only feeling empty and uncomfortable.

"Wuwuwu, I want, I want--"

Summer Song's mind was blank and she didn't know what she wanted to do. After "wanting" for a long time, she finally choked out a sentence--

"I want... to go home."

Addicted to pleasure, Summer Song's body was hot and swollen, and the most comfortable thing she could remember was the air conditioning at home.

In the moment the door was broken open, Gu Peijiu grabbed her sickle, picked up the person, crushed a piece of Danfeng teleportation stone, and the Tianzhu Ling raised a fierce cold wind. She trembled slightly, "Hmm, I'll take you home."

= =

Jianfeng.

The moon was pale, the cold wind brought snow, and the crow cried low.

Ye Ze was dreaming.

He dreamed of himself curled up in the grass, shivering, and a young girl's innocent laughter in his ears.

"Giggle..."

"Mother, is this okay?"

He looked up and saw the familiar front door. A white-clad girl sat on the old banyan tree, with a string of silver bells on her ankle. The swaying tree shadows covered her cheeks, making her face unclear, but he could hear her silver-bell-like laughter.

In the blood pool under the banyan tree lay two people whom Ye Ze was extremely familiar with, familiar to the bone.

Those two people raised him and taught him to become a man who could stand tall and firm. One was the head of the Ye family, tall and strict, who once taught him to be a man who dared to do and bear the consequences. The other was gentle and kind, not good at preaching, but would hold his hand and walk through the flower garden in their home, teaching him to recognize the peonies she had just planted.

And now they lay there, silent and motionless.

A slender woman in black stood beside them, behind her were countless demonized puppets wearing bronze masks. They roared and raged, and he heard the howl of his black dog from his family. When he was six or seven years old, that black-back dog was always by his side, following him wherever he went.

"Where did this stray dog come from? Why is it barking? Haven't you seen anyone killed before? It's so annoying."

The young girl seemed a little aggrieved, but also excited with innocence, "Mother, mother, if we silence them, does that mean we have to kill them all, not even leaving a dog behind?"

The woman below looked up at the girl on the tree, her blood-stained cheeks and brows gentle, "Hmm, what my baby says is right."
Her hand flicked downwards slightly, with a hint of cruelty in her eyes.

"Indeed... not even a dog should be left behind."

The demonized puppets began their excited roar and revelry!

And so, the scene of the howling of wild dogs and the slaughter of over two hundred members of the Ye family by the demonized puppets became a nightmare that Ye Ze would never forget.

"Oh... mother," the girl chuckled lightly, turned her head and looked towards Ye Ze's direction, "over there, seems like there's a fish that slipped through the net?"

Ye Ze suddenly opened his eyes!

Moonlight shone brightly outside the window, just like the bloody moonlight of that night, illuminating the entire small room.

He touched his forehead and indeed, it was covered in cold sweat.

He looked at the damp water in his hand and slowly clenched it, his nails sinking into his palm, almost drawing blood.

= =

When Xia Ge woke up, the sun was setting outside the window.

She stared blankly for a while before realizing that this was her new Danfeng luxurious single-person dormitory, with a two-meter-long sickle quietly leaning against the wall.

Scenes from the black market flashed through her mind like a movie, and the final scene ended before her addiction took over.

...What happened? Why did I come back?

Xia Ge asked the system, "How did I come back?"

The system replied, "...someone brought you back."

Xia Ge asked, "Who?"

Before the system could answer, the door creaked open quietly.

Xia Ge turned around and saw a girl in a red and white maple robe standing at the door, looking at her with an unreadable expression in her pitch-black eyes.

The system said, "Well, distant as the horizon, close as the eye."

"...Senior Sister?"
Xia Ge felt her brain freeze for a moment. "You came to find me?"

Gu Peiju nodded. "Yes, come help me sort out some documents."

As if nothing had happened.

Xia Ge looked at her clothes. "Oh, okay... let me change first."

"Sure."

Gu Peiju glanced at her and closed the door.

Xia Ge took out her clothes from the ring. "What did you mean just now? Did my senior sister send me back?"

The system replied, "Just what it sounds like."

After a pause, the system's voice became malicious. "And, it seems like she discovered that you were disguised as a man."

Xia Ge shuddered. "What did you say?! That's impossible-"

"Believe it or not, just be careful," the system said nonchalantly.

Xia Ge suddenly felt a heavy sense of impending doom.

The system continued, "It's not a big deal if you're discovered. It's not like you're deceiving someone's brotherly love for years like Ye Ze did."

It sounded reasonable, but something still felt off...

Xia Ge looked in the mirror and stopped.

The boy in the mirror had clean and fair skin. Her makeup had been wiped off, and her soft red hair was tied with black hair, making her look energetic and neat.

Xia Ge stared at the red hairband for a long time.

The hairband had been pretending to be dead, but Xia Ge's sharp gaze made it difficult to keep up the act. In the end, it trembled uneasily.

"It's really you."

Xia Ge's eyebrows twitched. She wasn't stupid. Seeing this little clothes demon and thinking about the system's words, the identity of the cloaked person was almost certain.

"Are you done?"


The sound outside the door was faint.

"...Alright."

Summer Song held her forehead and finally left the room, following Gu Peijiu to the study.

There wasn't anything important to do, just following behind her to organize the files. There weren't many files from Danfeng, and after she finished organizing them, she secretly watched Gu Peijiu using a red pen to mark the papers.

Why wasn't she asking anything?

Gu Peijiu was as stable as Mount Tai, not asking or saying anything. Summer Song, on the other hand, was starting to feel restless. If Gu Peijiu were to immediately torture and interrogate her, she would be nervous, but she had a way to cope with it. If it really came down to it, she could lie and deceive. But the more Gu Peijiu acted like nothing was wrong, the more uneasy Summer Song felt.

She thought for a moment, then walked up to Gu Peijiu and stood beside her like she had seen on TV. "Sister, I finished organizing the files!"

Gu Peijiu responded with a "Hmm," and said, "It's fine, you can go back now."

Summer Song was taken aback. Wait, you're not going to ask me anything? I went to the black market, isn't that suspicious? You should ask me something so I can come up with a way to fool you. If all else fails, you could at least make me copy some alchemy books, right?

This was all very strange.

If you don't ask anything, and you start imagining things, where can she go to cry?

Seeing that Summer Song wasn't moving, Gu Peijiu's hand holding the pen paused. "Why aren't you leaving?"

"Uh...hmm." Summer Song put her hands behind her back. "Um, sister, when can we start classes?"

"Tomorrow." Gu Peijiu said, "We'll distribute clothes tomorrow, so don't wander around."

Summer Song felt like Gu Peijiu's "don't wander around" had a deeper meaning. She suddenly felt nervous. "Oh...um...sister, you look really pretty today."

As soon as Summer Song finished speaking, she felt stupid.

In fact, she had originally wanted to say, "You're not punishing me, so can I give you the red ribbon on my head?" But after thinking about it for a while, she felt like it was too foolish to say. 

But when she came back to her senses, Summer Song realized that what she had said wasn't very clever either.
...Anyway, the system said that Senior Sister knows she is a girl, and since they are both girls, it's normal to compliment each other's beauty in a business context.

Oh, by the way, Senior Sister won't praise her for being pretty.

"Go back now." Gu Peiju nodded as if nothing had happened. "I understand."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge left in a daze.

Outside the study, clusters of pink ball flowers were blooming beautifully. Xia Ge vaguely felt that something was wrong, but couldn't figure out what it was.

Hmm, when someone complimented Senior Sister for being beautiful before, didn't she say, "Hmm, I know"? 

Why does she remember it differently now...?

Xia Ge stared as a butterfly landed on the blooming ball flowers.

...Forget it, she didn't want to think about it.

She went back to play with her puppet.

Inside the study.

After Xia Ge left, Gu Peiju put down her brush. Her pitch-black eyes were filled with some abnormal magic, but she closed them and opened them again, returning to her normal appearance.

- Senior Sister, you look so beautiful today.

She touched her lips and after a moment, her pupils slightly contracted before she lowered her hand.

The next day.

"Xia Wuyin, are you here to pick up your clothes too?"

The place where Danfeng gave inner disciples their clothes was a special cloth bureau. There was a long line now, and Xia Ge was at the end of the line. Mao Qing was not far behind her and clearly noticed her. She came over and patted Xia Ge's shoulder, handing her a piece of candy with a smile. "Here's a piece of Sakura candy from the new candy shop! I'll give you one!"

"Ah...oh."

Xia Ge took the candy. The white paper wrapped a pink candy, and the candy was wrapped around a small cherry blossom petal, which looked very pretty.

"What about Huo Bai? Have you seen him? I bought some extra for him." After giving Xia Ge the candy, Mao Qing began to look around with her head stretched out. Xia Ge slightly stiffened. "Uh, about that...I really haven't seen him."
Mao Qing looked around but didn't see anyone. She felt a bit disappointed and gave a piece of cherry blossom candy to Xia Ge, saying, "Oh well, you can have his piece."

Mao Qing said, "He wouldn't want this color anyway."

Xia Ge looked at the cherry blossom candy in her hand and said, "Then why did you buy it for him?"

Mao Qing saw through Xia Ge's thoughts and snorted, "I just wanted to see if he would show up. If he didn't, then forget it."

Xia Ge asked, "Why do you think I would take it?"

Mao Qing replied without hesitation, "Because you're a good person."

The system couldn't help but laugh.

"Oh, by the way, did you get a new hairband?" Mao Qing asked curiously, looking at the red hairband on her head. "It looks really nice. Is it new?"

Xia Ge lied, "No, I got it from the cloth seller in the village."

Mao Qing asked which seller it was and said she wanted to get one too. Then she noticed the wooden doll hanging from Xia Ge's waist instead of a jade pendant. Its eyes were inlaid with black stones, its lips were painted red, and it had long black hair. It was especially cute.

"What is this?" Mao Qing asked in surprise.

Xia Ge replied calmly, "Just a doll I carved."

Mao Qing exclaimed, "Wow, it's so cute! I didn't know you had this skill, Xia Wuyin."

Xia Ge laughed. As a puppeteer, she had to have some carving skills. The puppet she made was a special item that couldn't be stored in the silver ring, so she had to pretend it was a toy.

The small puppets she made had two forms: a normal wooden puppet form and a puppet form that could use its abilities. Both forms could be carved according to the puppeteer's preferences. The wooden puppet form would conceal all its aura, so unless the puppeteer was very powerful, no one would notice anything strange.

She had run out of points after buying paper pills and sanitary pads on the black market. Fortunately, she made this small puppet and the system rewarded her with fifteen points, which made her a little more comfortable.

Mao Qing squatted down to look at the small wooden doll and said, "Hmm... why do I feel like I've seen it before?"

Xia Ge asked, "Really?"
Mao Qing looked at it for a while and suddenly realized, "I know where I've seen this puppet before!"

Xia Ge looked up and suddenly said, "Hey, Huo Bai is here."

Mao Qing turned her head and sure enough, she saw Huo Bai.

Huo Bai's complexion was not very good, his black hair was casually tied up, and he was not wearing the flashy clothes he had before. He was just wearing a simple linen robe like the other disciples, with a white jade pendant engraved with runes at his waist.

"Why are you here so late?" Mao Qing naturally asked.

"I was delayed by something," Huo Bai replied in a natural tone, like a simple daily greeting to a friend. There was no trace of the cruel and cold madness he had shown in the black market. Xia Ge blinked and suddenly admired this quasi-spy of the demonic sect.

It's really hard to tell. Bai Ren is actually an actor with top-level acting skills.

If it weren't for the white jade pendant engraved with white runes, she would never have thought anything was wrong.

No... At first, when she saw the white jade pendant and combined it with the sudden appearance of the puppet, she only had a little suspicion, but didn't think too much about it. But the incident in the black market really caught her off guard and revealed the true face of this person.

"Congratulations," Huo Bai said, seeing Xia Ge beside them.

"Congratulations? Congratulations on what?" Xia Ge was confused.

"Congratulations on becoming a special student and entering the inner door," Huo Bai said strangely.

Mao Qing suddenly remembered this and clapped her hands, laughing, "How could I forget about this? Xia Wuyin, congratulations on becoming a special student and entering the inner door!"

Xia Ge: "......"

The system interjected, "Congratulations to the host for receiving sincere congratulations from the demonic sect spy, Bai Ren."

Xia Ge broke out in a cold sweat. "Haha... This, no need to congratulate me. I was also a little surprised."

Since they got their clothes and belongings quickly, the team moved forward quickly. The three of them didn't say much, and the team had already lined up nearby. Liu Xiaoqian was still looking at the account book. When he saw Xia Ge coming, he raised his eyebrows and said, "Oh, you've made progress. You've entered the inner door."

Xia Ge giggled, "It was unexpected, all unexpected."

Liu Xiaoqian glared at her, "Alright, alright. Study hard and aim for Dan Peak. Don't steam buns and compete for breath. Your clothes are over there. Go get them yourself."

After picking up her clothes, Xia Ge didn't stay long and said goodbye to the two before leaving the cloth bureau.
Mao Qing took her clothes and looked at Xia Wu Yin's hurried back as she hammered her head. "Hey, I was just about to say something to him, what was it that I forgot?"

Huo Bai glanced at her. "What did you want to say?"

"It's about that puppet doll. Did you see it just now? Xia Wu Yin carves wooden dolls and they look really good!" Mao Qing held her clothes and excitedly told Huo Bai, then became distressed. "I always feel like that doll looks like someone, I want to tell him, but I can't remember who."

Huo Bai wasn't interested. "I didn't notice."

"You're so clueless. You didn't even see such a big wooden doll." Mao Qing snorted, then became happy again. "But now I know who the doll looks like."

Huo Bai cooperated. "Who does it look like?"

"It looks like Senior Sister!" Mao Qing determined. "I can't say why, but...just the aura is similar!"

Huo Bai: "..."

Meanwhile, Xia Ge casually found a secluded spot to toss her clothes into the flowing silver and then headed straight for the Dan Feng Library.

The rumors of Town Spirit on the black market were fake. She still needed to find some real clues about Town Spirit, and she needed to do it as quickly as possible.

If the Demon Cult was releasing false news about Town Spirit's appearance to confuse people's attention, then it could only mean one thing...

The Demon Cult was also searching for Town Spirit!

Therefore, by releasing false news about Town Spirit's appearance, they were confusing others' attention and secretly investigating the true whereabouts of Town Spirit.

As for the traitor Bai Ren, he was probably also related to the Demon Cult's actions, but Xia Ge had no intention of reporting him.

There's an interesting thing called a counter-intelligence plan.

Xia Ge arrived at the Dan Feng Library, which had a lot of books. It was not an exaggeration to say that it included everything. Unlike the deserted Si Guo Library, there were many disciples from various peaks coming and going, and the clothes of each peak's disciples could be seen. There were even management disciples specifically responsible for guarding the books at the entrance.

Xia Ge showed her identity jade pendant to the person at the door and entered the library.

The Dan Feng Library was very large, with ancient bookshelves stacked one on top of the other, layer upon layer, and one could not see the end at a glance. Bound books were neatly arranged on the shelves, but fortunately, each area was labeled, so it was a bit difficult for Xia Ge to find what she was looking for on her first visit.

"Dan Fang Area," "Sword Technique Area," "...Area," Xia Ge ran up three floors before finally finding what she was looking for.

"History Section"

However, before Xia Ge could take a few steps inside, she saw someone unexpected. She almost immediately retracted her foot and sidestepped to the other side of the bookshelf, grabbing a book from the shelf and turning her back to use it as cover.
The sound of pages being turned came from behind, barely audible. After a moment, Xia Ge heard a cautious voice, "Miss Er, don't read here. Your eyes have been..." 

"Shut up." 

The impatient voice of a girl sounded, followed by the sound of the book being closed with a 'thud'. "Get out, don't bother me." 

"Yes, yes." 

Someone left through the gap in the bookshelf behind her. Xia Ge looked down at the book in her hand, feeling that life was full of unexpected encounters. 

To her surprise, as she lowered her head, she saw the first sentence of the book. 

"A long time ago, there was a group of bandits at Lingxi Peak..." 

Xia Ge raised an eyebrow in confusion. 

...The art of writing a book lies in its introduction. No matter how bad the rest of the book is, the beginning must be captivating. 

Xia Ge looked at the cover. Four shiny calligraphy characters, "Lingxi Wild Talks," could be vaguely seen. 

Well, no matter how ridiculous the content of this book may be, at least the beginning had successfully caught her attention. 

But now, it was obvious that this was not a good place to read. Xia Ge took the book and prepared to leave quietly, but she heard the girl exclaim, "Ah!" with a hint of surprise. She subconsciously turned her head and looked through the gap in the bookshelf. The sunlight shone in from outside the window, and a girl in a sword peak blue dress covered her eyes with her hand. A delicate butterfly embroidery was on her sleeve, and her thin lips were tightly pursed, making her look very uncomfortable. 

Xia Ge's heart skipped a beat. After a while, the girl let go of her sleeve, raised her black eyes, and looked straight at Xia Ge! 

Xia Ge was startled and took a step back unconsciously, but the girl seemed to have seen nothing. She raised her hand and felt for the position of the bookshelf behind her, groping for each spine one by one until she found a gap. She slowly put the book back in, her movements resembling those of a blind person. 

Chu Yi put the book back in place, turned to leave, but accidentally stepped on her skirt, stumbled forward, and grabbed the corner of the bookshelf with one hand to steady herself. 

Xia Ge clenched her fists slightly, feeling complicated. 

Chu Yi stood up, closed her pitch-black eyes, and remained motionless for a while. 

She didn't move, and Xia Ge didn't dare to leave. After a while, she heard the girl laugh. 

A low, somewhat cold, and creepy laugh.
There was a hint of madness and unwilling despair in her voice.

"Why...why me...why is it always me..."

"Hey, this...senior sister?" 

There weren't many people from the sword techniques and alchemy districts in the Zai Shi district. Or rather, few people came over here.

The sharp voice was eerie, like a eunuch from hundreds of years ago, making people's hair stand on end.

Xia Ge pinched her voice, looking around surreptitiously, afraid of being discovered. But before she knew it, her head was pulled down and a familiar dagger was pressed against her neck.

The pure black dagger, neither gold nor jade, was incredibly sharp. It was said to be made from a meteorite that fell from the sky and could cut through gold and jade, unstoppable.

The Starfall Blade.

Chu Yi's cold voice sounded, "Who are you?"

Her eyes were pitch black, reflecting Xia Ge's shadow, but there was no trace of emotion. Xia Ge waved her hand in front of her, but there was no response.

...She really couldn't see.

"I was passing by and saw that junior sister seemed a little uncomfortable." Xia Ge pinched her voice, her voice sharp and thin, speaking in an exaggerated manner. "Do you need any help? I can take you..."

The restraint on her head was released, perhaps because her voice made Chu Yi feel nauseous. Chu Yi put away the Starfall Blade, her face looking ugly. "No, go away!"

Xia Ge breathed a sigh of relief, paused, and quietly put something in her pocket before leaving immediately. When she reached the bookshelf, she couldn't help but turn around and take a look.

The blue and white butterfly dress girl was sitting on the ground, leaning against the bookshelf, with one hand on her knee. After her anger subsided, her almond-shaped eyes were black and lifeless.

She seemed a little powerless.

System: "Are you just going to leave it like this?"

Xia Ge: "...she'll be able to see soon, right?"

System: "But if you keep dragging it out, she might still go blind."

Xia Ge sighed. "I can't do anything about it."
System: "Tianmu grass must have the aura of the chosen one to continue to be effective."

Xia Ge: "I know."

System: "What are you going to do?"

Xia Ge: "...eat it cold."

System: "How can you be so heartless?"

Xia Ge: "I have always been heartless."

After speaking, Xia Ge grabbed her book and headed downstairs, feeling a bit flustered. She didn't expect to run into Chu Yi in the Danfeng Library.

Suddenly, she heard Chu Yi shout behind her, "Stop right there!"

Xia Ge's instincts kicked in and she started running.

System: "Why are you running?"

Xia Ge: "Whenever I hear 'stop', I run! It's experience!"

System: "..." Where did you get that experience from? Why doesn't the system have it? Are you just feeling guilty?!
