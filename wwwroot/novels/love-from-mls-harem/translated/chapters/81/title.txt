Chapter 81: The Scenery is Beautiful

The protagonist finally arrived at his destination after a long journey. As he stepped out of the car, he couldn't help but admire the beautiful scenery that surrounded him. The air was fresh and clean, and the mountains in the distance were covered in a blanket of green trees.

He walked towards the villa that he would be staying in for the next few days. The villa was situated on a hill, overlooking a serene lake. The sound of the water lapping against the shore was soothing to his ears.

As he entered the villa, he was greeted by a warm and cozy atmosphere. The furniture was made of wood, and the walls were adorned with beautiful paintings. The large windows allowed plenty of natural light to enter the room, making it feel bright and airy.

He walked towards the balcony and took in the breathtaking view. The sun was setting, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink. The calm waters of the lake reflected the colors of the sky, creating a stunning visual display.

He smiled to himself, feeling grateful for the opportunity to experience such beauty. He knew that this trip would be a memorable one, filled with new experiences and adventures.
