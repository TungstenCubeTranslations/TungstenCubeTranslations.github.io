As soon as the words fell, the moss on the boy's flute disappeared in an instant, revealing its true form as a dazzling divine light flashed by.

It was a snow-white jade flute, flawless and warm to the touch, but sealed within the jade was a strand of blood. The blood flowed like a snake, contrasting vividly against the white jade, creating an eerie and menacing atmosphere.

The green dragon roared instinctively, and a surge of green flames rushed towards the boy!

The boy slowly lifted his head, looking at the green flames approaching him with pure red eyes and even a hint of a smile on his lips. After a moment, as if he had made a decision, he nodded his head.

"I am...Huoming."

The red-blooded white flute rested on his lips, his blood-stained white clothes fluttering in the wind. As the flute sounded, the world shook!

The skull within the green flames twisted and roared, and countless bats and ghosts suddenly appeared and ran towards the dragon under the sound of the flute.

"Eight Wastelands, Annihilation."

As the flute sounded and the boy murmured softly, the previously silent space suddenly began to twist endlessly. The space seemed to have been cut into eight pieces, each flashing by like a silent film.

The Eight Wasteland World.

As the space was cut into eight pieces, the dragon let out a mournful cry, and its indestructible body was cut like tofu into eight pieces in the blink of an eye!

"Ao--"

The green blood spurted out!

The boy closed his eyes slightly, his smile gentle and nostalgic.

"We are finally together again."

Only you and I are the most suitable.

The dragon's severed body writhed frantically like a snake, struggling even though it had been cut. It roared in fear, causing the cave to tremble. The small animals controlled by the sound of the flute seemed to have gained terrible power, and every impact could cut off a layer of scales from its broken body. In the blink of an eye, the once arrogant green dragon was covered in wounds and looked almost unrecognizable.

The eight worlds had cut its existence, and because each piece of its body was in a different world, even the possibility of automatic healing was nonexistent.

It convulsed and looked at Huoming in despair. Despite being cut into eight pieces, its near-godlike vitality allowed it to endure this inhuman pain. It stared at Huoming and seemed to remember something, choking out a cold laugh: "So it was you."

"Thank you for giving me this opportunity," the boy's voice murmured softly. "So let you slowly die like this."

Even a divine dragon would suffer from being cut into eight pieces, let alone a dragon that had not undergone a divine calamity and had lost its inner core.
"Not to be feared.

The young man held a flute in one hand and slowly walked to Chu Yi's side, placing his fair fingertips gently on her neck. His eyes were hazy as he said, "I should clear the obstacles for you."

This person... is already useless.

The young man's hand suddenly paused.

He stopped not because the red ribbon named Lovesickness, who was trying to approach but was repeatedly bounced back by the flute's barrier, was beside him.

"It's not necessary?"

But because this body was resisting.

As if instinct was trembling.

Huo Ming smiled lightly, "You just need to get used to it."

The instinctive resistance of the body was still strong.

Huo Ming played with the jade flute in his hand and said lightly, "Since you don't like blood, I'll play her a song."

After a while, she picked up the flute and put it to her lips, her smile somewhat eerie. "All good things must come to an end."

Just as the sound of the flute was about to resound, an arrow shadow suddenly opened the jade flute in the young man's hand like lightning!

The arrow, originally illusory, turned into a solid form the moment it touched the flute. After knocking the flute away, it turned into light smoke and dissipated the moment it touched the ground.

With a "plop," the jade flute fell into the water.

The young man looked up and saw a dark shadow flash by, landing on the dying dragon's head.

The dragon's head was still in a small world with a mysterious and unpredictable transformation of the eight barren worlds and the stars. Only the dragon's head had not changed. Its blue blood dripped, and it was dying. The black-clothed girl stood on the dragon's head, her red eyes cold as she pointed the black bow that looked like a crescent moon at Huo Ming's eyes. Her face was covered by a black veil, and only a pair of ethereal eyes could be seen.

Huo Ming was shocked. "Who?!"

The black-clothed person carried a quiver on her back and covered her face with a veil. She didn't say a word, but if you looked carefully, you could see that her figure was blurry, and she was just a phantom.

The young man sneered and waved his hand. The fallen jade flute was freed from the water. "A trick of carving insects."

"Do you still remember me?"
At the moment when the jade flute was about to fall into the boy's hands, the black-clothed person spoke, pausing for a moment before whispering softly, "Shuang Shuang, don't do something you'll regret."

Although the icy arrow tip was pointed at her eyes and the breath was mysterious and cold, her voice was somewhat crisp and shy, like that of a young girl who had not yet grown up, like a thunderclap.

In an instant, Huo Ming felt her body stiffen, and then she uncontrollably took a step back. The jade flute that was about to fall back into her hands fell to the ground instead. The crisp sound was like a tremor from the depths of her soul, crazy, unbelievable, sad, and sorrowful.

Almost out of control, Huo Ming shouted, "She's fake! Don't be fooled by her. She's just an illusion from the Bai Meng Cave! She can't give you anything! But I can give you everything you want. I can help you overcome obstacles, and I can make you invincible."

The black-clothed girl's voice was faintly distant and blurred amidst Huo Ming's roar, but it was particularly gentle. It was a tenderness that passed through time and made people nostalgic.

"Don't you remember me?" It was Dou Dou.

It was a voice that seemed to have crossed the ages, awakening the sleeping soul. It was a true desire and call from deep within the heart.

Huo Ming couldn't take it anymore, she kicked the flute, caught it in her hand, and no longer had the calmness she had when playing Ba Huang Mie before. She looked like she was going mad, "You're already dead!! Dead--"

As long as it could satisfy this person's deepest desires, it could make chaos in the world without fear, and make thousands of soldiers perish with a wave of its hand. As long as the wish was fulfilled!

Before a stronger desire appeared, it could return to her side.
It fulfilled her previous wish to "stay alive," so now it is Xia Ge's curse.

A perfect deal.

Unwilling, it was unwilling... Even though it didn't have to make a deal...

"Get out of here, don't show up again!"

- You have to live well.

The black-clad girl smiled slightly and spoke softly, "It's okay if you forget."

"I remember, that's good enough."

This sentence was like the last straw that broke the camel's back. The boy's expression twisted for a moment, and she knelt on the ground with a thud. Her right eye was still a blazing blood red, but the blood in her left eye slowly faded away, gradually turning pure black. That black eye reflected the little world, and the figure gradually became blurred, but still held the bow and arrow pointed at the black-clad girl. Slowly, tears flowed from the corners of her eyes.

"I... haven't forgotten."

Tears flowed down her cheeks, into her mouth, with a bitter taste. Xia Ge murmured hoarsely, "I remember, I won't forget..."

... Dou Dou.

She remembered.

She just wanted... to live on.

Just like she promised with her... a long, long time ago.

Live well.

The curse's right eye turned red and crazy: "She wants to kill you! You have to live, right?! Let me kill her! I can kill her right away-"

So... give me your soul!

However, the body that was originally obedient and controlled couldn't move at this moment, and the soul that could be invaded by instinct seemed to be blocked by something and couldn't go further!

Impossible, clearly...

The curse stiffly lowered its head and suddenly noticed the doll on its waist flashing.

The puppet doll had a brilliant smile, and the protective array behind it flickered with light. In the moment when Xia Ge's soul awakened, it firmly protected the awakened soul, making it impossible for any opportunity to be taken. Just as the curse reached out to remove the doll, the black-clad girl's gaze became sharp, and the long arrow shot out!
"Swoosh--"

The black-tipped arrow pierced straight through the young man's right eye, leaving a bloody nail-sized hole in the white cloth on the wall as the intangible arrow soul vanished completely.

"Of course, you have to stay alive."

"But, you should be a little selfish... learn to live for yourself, that's better."

The arrow soul disappeared, and the figure of the young girl slowly vanished with the release of the arrow, leaving only a faint echo, like a dream, both real and unreal.

The dragon's head was empty.

The voice of the soft-spoken girl seemed like she had never existed, leaving nothing behind.

It was like a dream.

Xia Ge knelt on the ground, looking up at the dragon's head, with a blood-stained white jade flute in front of her, warm tears soaking her cheeks.

"Dou Dou..."

-Don't go.

Please...

However, there was nothing.

For a long time.

Xia Ge didn't know how long it had been.

Her knees were sore from kneeling, but she didn't want to stand up.

Her mind was blank for a while.

"Xiao Kui."

System: "I'm... here."

It seemed that she was feeling guilty about sealing her memories without permission.
"Who am I?" Xia Ge slowly lowered her head, clutching her chest and looking at the jade flute that sealed her blood below, murmuring, "Am I now...a calamity?"

"You're not," the system said. "You are Xia Ge now."

Who is Xia Ge? Is it her?

Or Xia Wuyin...?

Where did the meaning go...?

Xia Ge knelt on the ground, her mind tense just now, and now that the calamity had passed, she suddenly felt powerless.

Just now, the calamity used this flute recklessly, although the calamity had powerful spiritual power, it still had to use the spiritual power in its body as the foundation. She didn't feel it just now, but now that the calamity was gone, the Eight Desolate World opened by this flute had no source and directly sucked her power.

It can be imagined.

She raised her eyes, and without the support of the calamity's power, the Eight Desolate World could only make do with her power.

However, after drawing her power, the eight small worlds with their unpredictable stars hesitated for a second.

Yes, as if it was rejecting something, hesitating for a moment.

Then it broke very decisively, without turning for another second.

Xia Ge: "..." Damn.

The green dragon, which was divided into eight pieces by the Eight Desolate World, is now painfully piecing together its scattered body. After finally piecing it together and posing, it dare not move, for fear of breaking again.

Although Xia Ge has no strength now, it doesn't have the energy to trouble her again.

The old dragon who lost its inner alchemy still has to heal its broken bones first.

Xia Ge rested for a while and regained some strength.

"My memory was sealed by you? When?"

The system honestly explained the forced measure it took after her mental breakdown after being injured.

After listening, Xia Ge didn't say anything, silently looking at the place where the disappeared black-clothed girl had stood.
At that time, just after recovering her memory, when she heard Dou Dou's voice, she felt as if she had traveled through time. Then she was filled with hot blood mixed with deep regret and couldn't help but burst into tears when she thought of all the "what ifs" at that time.

But upon closer inspection, she felt that something was very wrong.

Dou Dou...how could she be here?

"Is that...Dou Dou?" She murmured.

System: "It's probably fake. Don't forget where you are."

The Dream God's dwelling, the White Dream Cave.

Anything could be an illusion, anything could be a hallucination.

She turned around, and the black soul arrow that had passed through her right eye had disappeared, leaving nothing behind.

It really felt like a dream.

But Xia Ge knew very well that it wasn't a dream.

That person who looked like Dou Dou really existed.

As proven by the flute.

"She said...to live well." Xia Ge murmured. "To live for myself."

"Her meaning should be, don't let the curse control you anymore." The system thought for a moment. "Although becoming a curse can make you very powerful, but that's not who you are."

That's right.

That's it.

Xia Ge looked at the flute on the ground, gave it a quick glance, and a faint green light flashed in her eyes.

[Flute of the Eight Wastelands: The divine flute that once swept across the Eight Wastelands.]

It's gone.

A simple sentence, and it's gone.
There was no mention of class, nothing was said.

But from the Eight Wilderness world that it created with its curse just now, it was clear that this was simply because the flute's quality was too high and she was too inexperienced, so she could only know its name.

But its origins were unclear.

Xia Ge always felt that it exuded an evil aura all over its body. This was not baseless suspicion.

The resonance of Jiao Blood and Jiao Dan allowed her to recover the memories sealed by the system. Although she had made a promise with Dou Dou before, it was not to the extent that it would make her mind race and make her fear for her life.

But in the instant when the seal on the flute was released-

She felt fear.

That kind of... "I'm definitely going to die" kind of fear.

The overwhelming sense of oppression, the absolute sense of fear, overwhelmed all reason in an instant, and it was only because of this that she made a "deal" with it.

Everything happened too quickly, and looking back on it, Xia Ge didn't know what had happened, she just turned into the curse.

System: "Pick it up."

Xia Ge: "I feel... this isn't something good."

System: "If you don't want it, just sell it to me for ten thousand points, cough, no, eight thousand points, since it's not something good anyway."

Xia Ge didn't need to imagine what the other party looked like when it was taking advantage of the situation.

The fact that the system, this stingy thing, was willing to offer ten thousand points for this flute showed that it was worth far more than that.

After thinking about it, Xia Ge still cautiously picked up the flute.

The moment her fingers touched the flute, she couldn't describe the feeling. In that moment, Xia Ge felt as if her blood had stopped for a moment, and the blood-colored thread inside the white jade flute twisted like a snake, then fell silent again.

That eerie feeling emerged for a second, then subsided again.

Although it was only for a short moment, Xia Ge was almost certain.

This flute definitely had some problems.

The reason why the curse dared to use it was because the curse was very strong and could use its absolute oppressive power to ignore anything wrong with it.
System: "...Are you okay?"

Xia Ge paused for a moment. "I'm fine."

She walked over to Chu Yi's side.

Little Xiangsi seemed unsure if it was her, and after a moment of hesitation, she timidly approached and rubbed against Xia Ge's hand.

System: "Earlier, there was a lot of ominous energy on you. Demons are very sensitive to it."

Xia Ge held the flute and touched Xiangsi. Once Xiangsi confirmed that it was her, she immediately pounced on her like a playful puppy, holding onto her wrist.

The sleeping draught she had bought from the mall seemed to be effective, as Chu Yi still hadn't woken up.

Her body and physical strength seemed to have become even stronger after being washed by the dragon's blood. Xia Ge effortlessly lifted Chu Yi onto her back.

The sickle had fallen into the pond.

Xia Ge didn't bother to pick it up. She carried Chu Yi on her back and looked up at the green dragon.

"How do we get out of here?"

Although the green dragon was almost dying from the ominous energy, it couldn't be bothered to answer the question of this insignificant ant who posed no threat to it.

"..."

Xia Ge thought for a moment and picked up the Eight Wilderness Flute.

The green dragon immediately shuddered, its eyes widened like copper bells, and it looked at her alertly, ready to dive into the water to escape at the slightest sign of danger.

Xia Ge crushed a spirit stone and restored some spiritual power, her lips curving into an innocent smile. "This is called the Eight Wilderness Flute. Do you want to hear me play a little tune?"

The green dragon sneered. "Ant!"

Three minutes later.

The green dragon, who had been beaten up by the little bat and the demonic music, showed her the way out and even retrieved the sickle from the bottom of the pond for her.
Well, even though we can't be as powerful as Huoming who can directly use the flute to open the Eight Wilderness World, it's still possible to control the little bats with soul control and sound control to fight.

Xia Ge carried Chu Yi and walked in the spacious cave, holding the Eight Wilderness Flute in his hand. He felt that this flute was really awesome.

With the melody of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" and the soul control sound, those little bats turned into fighter planes and attacked the Green Jiao like a shower of flower petals. Basically, every time they hit a scale, one piece of the Green Jiao's body would fall off. It was so painful that the Green Jiao kept howling.

So miserable.

So cool.

It seemed that the sound of this flute directly added an N-level buff to those little bats.

The downside was that after using it, the spiritual power was drained.

But it didn't matter, the spiritual stones that were replaced last time haven't been used up yet.

Xia Ge satisfiedly put the flute in his pocket and continued to walk forward with Chu Yi on his back. It seemed that the level of the flute was too high and Liu Yin couldn't store it.

Xia Ge walked in the cave with Chu Yi for a long time.

The directions given by the Green Jiao may not be accurate, but she could only pretend that they were correct and keep walking.

Because there was no spiritual power left, Xia Ge couldn't afford to wait for the Green Jiao to swim around in the pool to fully recover, even though she didn't know how many laps it would take for its body, which was shattered into eight pieces, to fully recover.

Just enjoy the thrill and leave when it's good enough.
