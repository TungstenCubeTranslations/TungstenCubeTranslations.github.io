As a translator, I would translate the provided text as follows:

Regarding the demonic puppets, the system seems unsure how to explain.

"Long, long ago, there was a very powerful puppeteer who wanted to create puppets with emotions that did not require the puppeteer's emotions," the system thought for a moment. "She took many wrong paths, one of which was to use the souls of humans or beasts as the 'emotional' material to make puppets."

Xia Ge pondered, "Are you talking about the puppeteer who created the 'leader' puppet with emotions?"

"Yes," the system replied.

"Oh, please continue," Xia Ge said.

"The outcome was, of course, a failure," the system said. "Usually, the souls that remain in the world are evil spirits with lingering attachments. Puppets that merge with these souls will only retain their crazed obsession from life and are difficult to control. Eventually, the obsession disappears, and they become machines that only know how to destroy. The puppeteer later gave up on this method."

"What about demonic puppets?"

"Although the puppeteer gave up, this method has been passed down," the system said. "People have a desire for immortality, and puppets are a part of fulfilling that desire. The puppeteer who appeared five hundred years ago was exceptionally talented, and the profession of puppeteer became popular in the Feng Yue continent. Anyone could make a puppet... using the secret technique passed down by that puppeteer, puppeteers helped others to preserve their souls in puppets..."

Xia Ge said, "But weren't these souls evil spirits?"

"The souls left in the puppet as a carrier will not turn into evil spirits for the time being," the system said. "Ordinary people can maintain their consciousness for ten years using this method, which is equivalent to borrowing the puppet's body and gaining ten more years of life."

"At that time, the common practice was to find a powerful master when the puppet lost consciousness after ten years and was about to become demonic, to destroy it and give it a proper burial."

"...Why have I never heard of this method now?" Xia Ge asked.

"Because this method is now a forbidden technique," the system said. "Souls originally could reincarnate, but the souls parasitic in the puppet can only become evil spirits when the puppet becomes demonic after ten years. After these demonic puppets are destroyed, the evil spirits parasitic in them will only disperse. They will not be transcended, nor will they enter reincarnation."

"So it's listed as a forbidden technique," the system said. "But basically, those who do evil now, besides demons, are various demonic puppets and Yimei... you know, in fact, even though it's called a forbidden technique, there are still many people who take risks."

Xia Ge reached out and flicked the small puppet in her hand. In this world, there were always many people who touched taboos for various reasons.

In fact, there was no high or low status. She was no exception.

"Can it speak?" Xia Ge suddenly asked.

"No," the system said. "These small puppets are usually kept to explore, eavesdrop, or assassinate."

"It won't grow up?" Xia Ge was a little disappointed.

"If you want to turn it into your 'leader'," the system said, "but low-level puppeteers can make many of these emotional small puppets because they are weak and cannot cause a backlash."
"If it's destroyed, I think I would be very sad," Xia Ge touched her conscience and said sincerely.

System: "...That really puts you in a difficult position."

"Ah, never mind, the puppet is made and upgraded. Let's talk about the main upgrade mission for the puppeteer," Xia Ge smiled, "The main task for the puppet apprentice is to collect five materials to make a glass puppet before upgrading. So what is the task for the puppeteer?"

"Capture the 'Soul Suppressing'," the system said.

"'Soul Suppressing'? What is that?" Xia Ge was slightly surprised.

"A garment spirit," the system said. "A garment spirit called 'Soul Suppressing'. When worn, it can suppress a hundred ghosts and souls without harm."

It sounded very powerful.

Xia Ge asked, "So where is it?"

"I don't know," the system said.

Xia Ge: "..."

The system hypocritically said, "Come on, host, you are already a puppeteer! Keep working towards becoming a master puppeteer! This mission is very simple, just capture the 'Soul Suppressing' and subdue it, and you can ascend to the heavens! It's really simple!"

Xia Ge said, "It sounds like a game official promotion slogan, but I don't feel motivated at all."

And it didn't seem simple at all.

"Okay, host, let's be optimistic and take a look at the upgrade rewards!" The system hypocritically changed the subject. "There are many great rewards!"

Xia Ge felt disgusted with the system's meaningless topic change, but she still cooperated on the surface -

Xia Ge said, "Rewards... can I get a hundred billion in windfall?"

System: "..."

Xia Ge said, "If not, then shut up, thank you."

The system was heartbroken and indignant. "Can't you have some ambition? What is a hundred billion? Isn't being able to fly over walls and walk on roofs much stronger than a hundred billion? Don't you understand this simple truth - it's better to teach a man to fish than to give him a fish?"

Xia Ge's face was full of despair. "I don't want to be the best in the world, I just want a huge sum of money to rain down from the heavens and become rich overnight."

System: "..."
The system's voice lowered quietly, "Actually, you can think of it this way: become the number one in the world, then rob the Qianhun Sect. Not only will you become rich overnight, but you'll also gain a good reputation for upholding justice. Isn't that great?"

The Qianhun Sect is the number one demonic sect in the Fengyue Continent.

Xia Ge's face was full of righteousness: "Xiaogui! I never realized that you were such a shameless person! How can you distort the meaning of 'upholding justice'? How can such a sacred thing as upholding justice be tainted with the smell of money? It's truly unreasonable!"

The system chuckled twice, "It seems that the host doesn't want it. It's okay, I don't want to give it either."

Xia Ge went along with it, "Xiaogui, good and evil are nothing more than a matter of personal gain or loss. It's normal for people to rob the rich to help the poor, and upholding justice is the duty of us Lingxi Peak disciples. But I deeply believe that it's also normal to earn a little extra money while upholding justice...after all, everyone needs to eat. How can you say it's shameless?"

The system said coldly, "Oh."

Xia Ge continued with righteous indignation, "Xiaogui, we've spent three years together, how can you not understand my heart?"

...It's precisely because I understand it too well that I don't want to continue this conversation.

The system sneered, "I'm shamelessly distorting your 'upholding justice' that's full of righteousness."

Xia Ge didn't even blink, "As I just said, good and evil are nothing more than a matter of personal gain or loss. It's not unreasonable to earn a little extra money while upholding justice. After all, everyone needs to eat...how can you say it's shameless?"

The system: "..."

You are indeed the most shameless one, without a doubt.

After sneering, the system still gave out rewards.

[Ding! System upgrade reward! Congratulations to the host for obtaining 15 points! The points mall is now open!]

[Ding! {Soul Capture} upgraded! {Ghost Shadow} upgraded! {One Hit Kill} upgraded! Congratulations to the host for unlocking a new skill, {Soul Control Sound}!]

"What is Soul Control Sound?" Xia Ge didn't pay attention to the points mall, and just curiously clicked on the new skill panel.

The system was very indifferent, "Figure it out yourself."

[Soul Control Sound Level 1

Proficiency 0/3]
Skill introduction: Can control puppets with the sound of musical instruments, and can control evil spirits after level 3.

Xia Ge stared at the words "evil spirits" for a while and said, "Being able to control evil spirits seems very powerful."

The system was a little proud and said, "Of course it's powerful. All of my skills are the most powerful!"

Xia Ge said with a worried expression, "But I don't know how to play musical instruments."

The system said, "..." Can you let me be proud for three minutes? Three seconds will do if not.

Xia Ge said, "Can I change my skill?"

The system perked up and said, "No, you can't. Puppeteers have three small levels and three skills are randomly assigned. Once determined, they cannot be changed unless you can obtain the 'Town Soul' and ascend to become a puppet master."

Xia Ge said, "..."

The new skill turned out to be useless, and there was no surprise at all.

Xia Ge opened the points mall.

There were many things in the points mall, and Xia Ge's eyes were dazzled. She even saw a machine gun.

Xia Ge said, "..." Hey, is it really okay to put this kind of thing with a different style here?!

The system clearly eavesdropped on her thoughts again and said, "Of course it's okay, because you can't afford it."

Xia Ge silently shifted her gaze from the Xiaomi submachine gun to the points below it.

"1, 2, 3, 4..."

The system asked knowingly, "What are you counting?"

Xia Ge said expressionlessly, "The zeros at the end."

The system giggled, "Wow, there are so many."

Xia Ge once again felt the pain of being poor from the system's maliciousness.

"What can I buy with fifteen points..."
After a rough scan, Xia Ge realized that anything with an inappropriate art style was outrageously expensive. The points all started with millions and ended with billions.

For example, a bar of Shu X Jia soap for 100 billion.

...Unbelievable.

Xia Ge finally found something she could afford at the end.

【Lingtangshan Xiajinjiang branch's soup dumplings, local special offer, free shipping for 15 points!】

Xia Ge: "..."

Enough! The Jinjiang baozi shop at the door only charges one copper coin for a meat soup dumpling!

You're fucking charging 15 points for free shipping at the door!

Suffocating!

Shitty system! Shitty point mall!!!

Xia Ge promptly closed the page. "I'm going to sleep."

The system's voice sounded like an old brothel mistress soliciting customers in Xia Ge's ear. "Don't go, dear guest. Take another look. The free shipping soup dumplings and the ones at the door are not the same~"

Xia Ge: "Heh."

What a fucking annoying reward.
