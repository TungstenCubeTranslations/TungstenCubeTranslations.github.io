The stars twinkled in the pitch-black night. Memories were numerous and blurry, but the smile of that girl slowly faded, becoming shallow, and eventually disappeared without a trace.

On that day, with the arrival of winter following autumn, accompanied by drifting snowflakes, the Nanming Village, where nothing had been harvested, suffered from increasingly severe famine.

The only family with surplus food in the village was the Zhu family, but they were notorious for their domineering behavior and were not known for their charitable acts.

Summer still remembered when the two of them secretly huddled behind a woodshed of a household, already so hungry that their eyes turned black, but they couldn't even find a single leaf to eat.

That was the first time she felt so close to death.

Doudou was even more accustomed to hunger than her, and when she was too weak to move, Doudou could still move.

"Doudou... am I going to die?" Summer's voice was hoarse, and Doudou held her hand. In the cold winter, the girl's palm was cold, but also gentle.

She thought.

People will all die eventually. Sima Daren said that people are destined to die, either as heavy as Mount Tai or as light as a feather. She was just a poor beggar in this world, with no value other than begging for food.

Summer's vision grew dark, and she knew she was about to die, but she didn't feel desperate, just a little regretful.

She didn't have the chance to do something great like other awesome transmigrators who opened shops, reformed systems, and established currency circulation. Instead, she was just a six-year-old beggar who was starving to death and didn't know anything. It was really regrettable.

But even if she had the chance, she might not have the ability to do it.

After all, she knew her own weight. Being able to dig up water chestnuts with Doudou from the swamp was already a blessing from the God of Wealth. There was nothing more to think about.

So after thinking about it this way, she had no regrets left.

Perhaps because she didn't have a sense of belonging here, Summer didn't feel like a lonely stranger in a foreign land. On the contrary, she felt quite relaxed.

Maybe if she died... she could go back.

Perhaps she didn't transmigrate, and everything in front of her was just a ridiculous dream she had in reality. She died here, but she would come back to life there.

It sounded... pretty good.

It's just a pity for Doudou, this girl.

The two of them... this body, it must have been an important friend of Doudou's.
Sorry... Shuangshuang, borrowing her body, I couldn't take care of her friend properly. It's because she's useless. The only good thing she did for this child was that meal of water chestnuts.

After she said, "Am I going to die?" Dou Dou didn't say anything. She just held her hand tightly. It was freezing cold and Dou Dou's hand was also cold. She looked at her and pursed her lips without saying anything.

"Dou Dou," Xia Ge heard her hoarse voice and even laughed, "If I die accidentally, remember to burn two water chestnuts for me when you become successful."

Dou Dou's lips tightened even more. She squeezed her hand hard, as if she thought she could get more warmth from her that way.

But it was still cold.

No matter how hard she squeezed, it was still cold.

Xia Ge thought with a sense of desolation that the words "starvation and cold" that she had only read about in books were now being used on her. It's no wonder that the ancient poet Shao Ling Ye Lao once sighed in front of a small thatched cottage, "How can I have a thousand rooms in my house? It would shelter all the poor and cold scholars in the world." 

Unfortunately, she didn't have that kind of enlightenment. Until now, she could only sigh and say, "Ah, I think I'm going to starve to death."

When she was about to faint from hunger, Xia Ge finally heard the low voice of the girl who had been silent for a long time. It was firm and resolute.

"You're not going to die."

She slowly loosened her grip on Xia Ge's hand and spoke softly, "Shuangshuang, you have to be good and wait for me to come back."

- What are you going to do?

Xia Ge instinctively grabbed her clothes, but she was too weak and Dou Dou gently pulled them away.

- Where are you going?

- Don't go... come back!

Everything went black in front of her, and Xia Ge fainted. The last thing she saw was the figure of the girl named Dou Dou, wearing thin linen clothes and bare red feet, pushing open the door.

- The wind is strong and it's very cold.

The next second, she didn't know anything.

But maybe it was because she was too hungry or maybe it wasn't her time to die yet, Xia Ge regained consciousness after a while due to the severe stomach cramps caused by hunger. She took a break for a while and the first thing she did was to look for Dou Dou.

- Dou Dou, where did Dou Dou go?

- Could it be... Zhu's house!
Xia Ge felt anxious in her heart. She dragged her weak body and stumbled out of the small shed, braving the wind and frost, and headed straight towards the wealthiest family in Nanming Village without hesitation.

"Doudou, don't do anything stupid!"

"Beat that little slut to death!"

"Kill her!"

The sound of a whip striking flesh came from behind the tightly closed vermilion gate. Xia Ge heard a familiar groan and for a moment, her entire brain went blank. She pounded on the door with a hoarse voice, "Open up! Open up!"

The snow on the door was icy cold, but Xia Ge felt that nothing was colder than her heart at the moment. Her voice was hoarse and weak, but no one paid attention to her. Xia Ge desperately clung to the copper latch on the door, feeling the bitter cold wind, listening to the distant howling of wild dogs, and suddenly felt a sense of confusion.

Who was she...and why was she here?

Who was the person inside getting whipped for her...?

"Crack!"

"Crack..."

"..."

One whip, two whips, many many whips...

"Tsk tsk, it's not good to beat her to death. It's really unlucky. Throw her out!"

The door opened and Xia Ge, caught off guard, fell in. But she was kicked out fiercely by someone, "Where did this beggar come from? Shut up and leave! We can tolerate a thief, but squatting at our door is just annoying! Get lost!!"

Being kicked in the stomach, her already empty stomach was even more painful, making her hold her breath. But Xia Ge had no time to care. Her eyes were fixed on the little girl covered in blood who had been thrown out with the door.

The white snow was cold, and Xia Ge, clutching her stomach, stumbled over to Doudou, "Doudou, Doudou...Doudou--"

The girl covered in blood was in a daze, and it took her a while to react. Suddenly, she shuddered, pushed Xia Ge away fiercely, and then got up and walked towards the direction of the small dilapidated shed. However, she only took a few steps before falling to the ground again, her bleeding wounds tearing open, blood flowing incessantly. Xia Ge ran up to her, intending to help her up, but heard her hoarse voice say, "Who are you? Go away, don't touch me. I want to go back..." 

It seemed that she didn't see Xia Ge. Doudou's usually gentle and soft voice became hoarse, as if her vocal cords had been injured. It was also mixed with a fierceness that Xia Ge had never seen before, like a small animal in despair, desperately protecting her last glimmer of hope.
Xia Ge was afraid of touching her wound and afraid of causing her more struggle. Suppressing her stomach ache, her voice became hoarse to the point of deformation, "You can't move, don't move! I'll go, I'll go--"

Xia Ge dared not touch her and could only step back several steps. Perhaps sensing the other's retreat, Dou Dou bit her lip as blood slowly trickled down from her forehead. She paid no attention to it and slowly got up. Her crimson feet stepped on the snowy ground and she staggered forward. "I... want to go back..."

The snow was slippery and Dou Dou stumbled and fell after a few steps. Xia Ge's heart clenched and she wanted to help, but Dou Dou slapped her hand away fiercely. "Don't, don't touch me..."

Her voice was hoarse and vaguely crying, "Shuang Shuang is going to die... Shuang Shuang can't die."

"Shuang Shuang..."

She crawled forward on her knees, leaving a trail of blood.

She was calling her name in pain and tenderness.

It was like a bucket of cold water poured from head to toe, leaving Xia Ge stiff in place.

- In fact, Xia Ge had always thought that death was not a big deal. She had walked through the gates of the underworld before. When she woke up from the fatal car accident, she wanted to live well and take care of her younger brother. But she inexplicably came here, becoming a little beggar, suffering from hunger and cold, with no hope of going home and no relatives to turn to.

She thought, it's better to die than to live hopelessly. If she could live, then she would live. If she couldn't, then she would die. After all, no one here cared about the life or death of a little beggar. No one cared whether she was alive or dead. And maybe dying would bring her good luck and send her back home.

She thought that it was better to die gracefully than to live without hope.

But now, Xia Ge looked at this person kneeling on the cold snowy ground, covered in blood, calling her name over and over again, saying she couldn't die.

- Shuang Shuang can't die.

"Why?" Xia Ge looked at the figure crawling forward and couldn't help it anymore. She dragged her weak body and finally knelt in front of Dou Dou, holding her shoulders and tears streaming down her face - a kind of inexplicable anger surged up in Xia Ge's heart. Her voice was hoarse as she shouted, "She's not worth it!"

She was so terrible, living freely as Xia Ge and living as garbage as Shuang Shuang - how could such a person be worth your effort?!

"Worth it..." Dou Dou was like an enraged little beast. She opened her black eyes wide with anger and slapped Xia Ge hard, saying, "Who are you?! What right do you have to ask me? Let me tell you, as long as it's Shuang Shuang - it's worth it!"

- If it's Shuang Shuang, then it's worth it.

The slap didn't hurt because the other person had no strength.

But for Xia Ge, it was like a sudden realization. She suddenly remembered something very important.

Right now, she was not Xia Ge, she was Shuang Shuang.
She had the power to decide the life and death of "Xia Ge," but no right to end the lives of "Shuang Shuang."

Whether it was hopeless or hopeful, she had used her body, and therefore had the obligation to carry on, bearing all of her burdens.

She had no right to end anyone's life. After using the bodies of Shuang Shuang, she was no longer Xia Ge.

She was not Xia Ge, not trash, not an ant, but Dou Dou's only friend, Shuang Shuang.

- Therefore, she had to live.

"I am Shuang Shuang... Dou Dou, I am Shuang Shuang."

Dou Dou took a moment to react, her pitch-black eyes reflecting her face, but inside, there was only confusion. "Shuang Shuang? Shuang Shuang is here? You are Shuang Shuang? Why is it so dark... Why can't I see... Did I just hit you?"

"Does it hurt? Does it hurt? I'm sorry, Shuang Shuang, I didn't mean to!"

Dou Dou cried, "I didn't mean to, I can't see, I thought it was a ghost, I thought the ghost was going to take me away, I heard so many strange sounds, I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Waaah..."

"It's okay, it's okay, it doesn't hurt, Dou Dou's hands are very soft..."

As Xia Ge spoke, she trembled and slowly reached for Dou Dou's back of the head, and indeed, it was warm to the touch.

She withdrew her hand, her palm bright red and glaring.

The whip had hit the back of her head... Dou Dou seemed to have gone blind.

Dou Dou wiped away her tears, trying hard to stretch out her hand to touch Xia Ge's face, trying to confirm if she was Shuang Shuang or not. Blood smeared Xia Ge's face, the smell of rust was pungent, her pitch-black eyes widened, but she couldn't see anything. "Shuang Shuang, did you cry?"

Xia Ge held her wrist, trying not to let her tears fall on Dou Dou's hand, her voice hoarse, "I didn't cry, I didn't cry at all, I'm very tough, those were snowflakes melting on my face."

Dou Dou slowly felt Xia Ge's features with her hand, feeling sad, her voice soft, "Shuang Shuang is lying... Snowflakes melting are cold, but your tears are hot."

"Maybe it's because I... was born shining and also happened to be hot?"

Xia Ge wanted to smile, but her lips couldn't form a curve. Her stomach was in acute pain from hunger, and in front of her was a blind girl with warm tears streaming down her face.

No, she couldn't be like this.

She couldn't stop smiling in front of Dou Dou just because she couldn't see anymore.

"Don't cry, Shuang Shuang, you look beautiful when you smile." After Dou Dou finished speaking, she foolishly smiled, "Shuang Shuang, let's eat something, after eating, you won't cry anymore."
Xia Ge saw her carefully take out half a steamed bun from her pocket, her smiling face as bright as the clouds in the sky. "Shuangshuang, I'm so clever. I hid it and they didn't find it. Shuangshuang, let's eat."

Xia Ge stood still, not moving. Dou Dou was confused as to why she wasn't speaking, and reached out to touch her face. She slowly moved her hand down to Xia Ge's ice-cold hand and placed the half-cold steamed bun in her palm. The bun was stained with blood due to her injuries.

Holding the blood-stained bun, Xia Ge stood there in a daze for a long time. She realized for the first time that even when starving to the point of death, there could still be something that one didn't want to eat.

The howling of wild dogs was terrifying, and the wind and frost were extremely cold.

"Shuangshuang, eat quickly. After you're full, could you do me a favor?" Dou Dou said softly.

Xia Ge slowly clenched Dou Dou's hand, her voice hoarse. "Dou Dou, what do you want me to do?"

"Go to a village to the east. There's a girl I like there. She likes to watch the stars at the village entrance every midnight. Her eyes are full of stars, so beautiful. Tell her for me... that Dou Dou has secretly liked her for a long time."

Dou Dou's voice was gentle, and she opened her lifeless eyes. "Her eyes are black, very black, but so beautiful. Dou Dou likes her very much... Shuangshuang, after eating Dou Dou's bun, could you go and see if she's okay?"

Were there really other villages to the east? Xia Ge was stunned. She thought that there was only Nanming Village within a few hundred miles.

"Okay." Xia Ge heard her own voice struggling. "I'll carry you and we'll go together."

"But I just want you to go, Shuangshuang." Dou Dou's voice was soft. "I'm too ugly now, and I'll scare her. Besides, I can't see her. I'll be very sad if I go. Please, Shuangshuang."

In the end, Xia Ge settled Dou Dou in the woodshed and carried the half-eaten bun. She was about to leave the shed when she turned around to look at the girl leaning against the wall. Although she was blind, her eyes were still open, black and shiny, as if she could see Xia Ge turning back.

Xia Ge felt warm liquid sliding down her face. When she touched it, it was blood and tears.

"Is that girl pretty, Dou Dou?" Xia Ge heard herself choking.

Dou Dou paused for a moment, then smiled. "Very pretty."

Xia Ge forced herself to smile. "If there's a pretty girl, then you won't need me anymore. You're such a little liar."
Doudou pursed her lips and smiled, "It's not the same, you are my faith."

She said, "Shuangshuang must live well all the time, so that I can have strength and bless me."

Xia Ge held the cold buns in her hand, "Hmm."

"Swear it, Shuangshuang." Doudou smiled, "Swear to live well, so I can be at ease."

Tears slid down her chin and fell on her thin clothes. Xia Ge heard her hoarse voice, "Hmm, I swear, no matter what, Shuangshuang will live on."

"Wrong, it's live well." Doudou corrected softly.

Xia Ge finally couldn't help it, her voice choked, "Hmm, live well!"

"Go quickly, if you're late, you won't see the girl I like." Doudou's lips curled up with a gentle smile, her eyes shining like blooming peach blossoms in March. She said, "I will be sad if that happens."

After Xia Ge left, she thought, Doudou is really beautiful.

She didn't notice it before, but now she thinks that she might be the most beautiful girl she has ever seen.

The wild dogs were howling fiercely. Xia Ge walked all night, listening to the howling slowly fading away until it was barely audible. She arrived at the village in the east and went door to door looking for the most beautiful girl.

Of course, she didn't find the most beautiful girl.

Because she thought no girl was more beautiful than Doudou.

But this won't work.

So, for every girl she met in the eastern village, she would stop them and tell them seriously that there was a girl named Doudou who might like them - she looked good, especially when she washed her face in the creek and deliberately smiled sweetly. The girls in the village were simple, and every time she stopped someone, she would shamelessly ask for food.

The eastern village was also suffering from famine, so few people were willing to give her food, but Xia Ge still managed to get some by begging with a smile. She held the food and hurried back.

Xia Ge didn't believe that a beautiful girl would run out in the middle of the night to look at the stars. Her original purpose for coming to this village was just to get more food and then hurry back to exchange it for medicine to treat Doudou's injuries.

"Hey, little girl with the strange face." A ragged little beggar noticed that she was going in the wrong direction and grabbed her. "Where are you going?"

"I'm going back to Nanming Village." Xia Ge was anxious. It had been a day and a night, and she had found the food. She still needed to use it to ask the doctor in Nanming Village to help Doudou with her injuries.

"Why are you going to Nanming Village?" The little beggar widened his eyes. "A porter who went there this morning came back and said that Nanming Village was hit by a wave of evil spirits last night. Did you come from Nanming Village?"

"You're really lucky." The little beggar sympathized. "Is there someone very important to you in that village?"
The stars were shining brightly as Xia Ge stood at the entrance of the village, but her food fell to the ground. 

"What did you say?" 

The Evil Ghost Tide. 

Legend has it that evil ghosts will come in the middle of the night, silently eating everyone and leaving no trace behind. 

Only those who are dying and can see ghosts can sense the arrival of the Evil Ghost Tide. 

"I didn't mean to, I couldn't see, I thought it was a ghost, I thought the ghost was coming to take me away, I heard so many strange noises, I'm sorry, I'm sorry... sob... sob..." 

When Xia Ge returned to Nanming Village, the dawn was breaking and there was not a living soul in sight. 

Nanming Village had become a dead village occupied by evil ghosts. 

Dou Dou was gone. 

Everyone was gone. 

Even the Zhu family at the village entrance was reduced to a pool of blood. 

The air was thick with ghostly energy that even the sunlight could not disperse, and the stench of blood filled the sky. 

People eaten by evil ghosts would not leave behind their bodies. 

Xia Ge kneeled in the woodshed, looking at the bloodstain for a long time, feeling lost. 

It turns out that there really are evil ghosts in this world that eat people. 

So... she should have thought of it earlier. 

She thought of the howling of the wild dogs before she left. 

She thought of how Dou Dou had never left Nanming Village and had no way of meeting the girl he liked from the village to the east. 

It hurt, it hurt a lot. 

Xia Ge trembled as she took out the half-eaten, blood-stained bun from her pocket and stumbled to the crooked-neck tree where they had once watched the stars together. She buried the bun and erected a tombstone without any words for that girl. 

She realized that she never knew Dou Dou's full name.
She never asked Dou Dou about the girls he liked before, who was in his family, or how he became a beggar.

She knew nothing and understood nothing when she came to this world. She lived aimlessly and indifferently, not caring about the world and living a meaningless life.

Her reason was simple: she believed she was dreaming.

But why?

Why could a girl like her, who was indifferent to everything and regarded everything as a dream, make Dou Dou say such things?

She knelt in front of the tombstone, looking at the blood-stained buns, crying for a long time with tears streaming down her face, feeling heartbroken.

It was the saddest she had ever cried since coming to this world.

For the first time, she felt that this was actually a real world.

In this world, there was a girl named Dou Dou who stole buns to feed her, lied to her to make her leave, and faced the surging ghosts and the pain of her wounds alone in the corner, all for the sake of keeping her alive.

Apart from her, no one in this world knew that there was a child named Shuang Shuang who was Dou Dou's faith on this lonely and bewildering path.

Xia Ge couldn't remember how she left Nanming Village. She only knew that she had put on Xia Wuyin's name in a sorry state, as if this could ignore the fact that she was the girl Shuang Shuang, who Dou Dou admired, and the one who caused Dou Dou's death.

Just Shuang Shuang.

And Shuang Shuang had long since fallen asleep with Dou Dou's death.

But she, Xia Ge, still had to live on behalf of Shuang Shuang.

She made a vow.

But every night since then, Xia Ge dreamed of the ghosts eating people. She dreamed of Dou Dou, covered in blood, looking at her. Although he was dying, his eyes were still gentle.

But that gentle girl was eaten by the ghosts, bit by bit, with no bones left.

And she could only watch helplessly in her dreams.

Dou Dou's gentle voice still echoed in her ears.

"Shuang Shuang, you have to live well."

From then on, Xia Ge began to hate her own weakness and fear the responsibilities of being strong.
She was unable to become anyone's belief.

No matter how strong and powerful she was, it was the same.

She couldn't save anyone.

She was powerless.

"But it's different, you are my belief."

To save her, Dou Dou was covered in blood, and Xia Ge never wanted to see anyone in that state again.

From now on, she didn't want to be strong enough to be someone's belief, nor did she want to be weak enough for someone to die because of her.

Belief is bullshit.

She is the powerless Xia Wuyin.

That's all.
