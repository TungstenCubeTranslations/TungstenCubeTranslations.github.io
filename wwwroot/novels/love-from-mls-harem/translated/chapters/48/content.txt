The wind was whispering and the leaves rustling.

The guardians of the tomb on the hill behind were stiffly moving their bodies, which were not driven by anyone, and their tattered clothes were fluttering around, creating a chaotic scene of demons dancing.

The entrance to the tomb, which no one had taken care of, was overgrown with weeds, and the green stone steps leading underground were covered with damp moss. The inscription on the entrance stone was obscured by the overgrown weeds, and due to wind and rain erosion, the words on it had become somewhat blurred.

Su Chan stood in front of the stone, her blood-red dress stained with a little dampness, the golden hairpins between her eyebrows glinting faintly. She gazed quietly at the dilapidated stone for a long time, and finally slowly bent down, using her slender, snow-white fingers to wipe away the mud and moss on the stone, revealing the inscription.

"Obviously, you had three thousand disciples."

Su Chan's voice was soft, mixed with the sound of the wind, "But in the end, not even a gravekeeper was left behind."

The inscription on the stone was blurred and ancient, and it was impossible to see what was written on it.

However, Su Chan looked quietly at it for a long time, and finally sighed softly, leaning against a tree. The lush green trees and misty mountains surrounded her, and she took out a bone flute from her sleeve.

The bone flute was crystal clear, like white jade, with a red knot at the end. Su Chan lowered her eyes and placed the flute horizontally against her lips, playing it gently.

The red-clothed young girl leaning against the green tree, playing the flute, was bright and unrestrained, but the sound of the flute she played was soaked with inexplicable sadness.

The sound of the flute was low and gentle, but without any demonic nature, carrying a shallow sense of longing, slowly spreading out, mixed with the mountain wind, and drifting far away.

The numb guardians of the tomb puppets slowly moved their stiff bodies with the sound of the flute, cutting down trees and pulling weeds, cleaning the stone steps, and slowly cleaning up the graves that they should have been guarding, all in the melodious and sorrowful sound of the flute.

After the tune was over, Su Chan put down the flute and looked at the newly renovated tomb, but did not feel happy.

She paused, seeming to be pondering something, for a while.

"I saw your disciple today, who looks a lot like you."

"Lost Deer brought her here, and at first, I thought it was you who had returned."

"But Bai Guai did not respond."

Su Chan looked at the bone flute in her hand, her eyes unfathomable.

"...it doesn't matter."

Su Chan put away the flute and took out a sandalwood box from her sleeve. After opening it, half of a sheepskin map lay quietly inside.
It's half of a map to Evil Spirit Mountain.

After a while, she chuckled softly, closed the box, and walked to the damaged tombstone. Her slender fingers caressed the eroded words on it. Even though the words had faded to a blur, the girl slowly recited the sentence that had once been engraved on it, word by word, as if carving it into her heart.

"The undefeated spirit suppresses all evil spirits, and the place of return is unknown to the gods."

Using the undefeated spirit that can suppress millions of evil spirits to redeem the mistakes you made. So, were you able to be so at ease back then?

- The place of return is unknown to the gods.

"I don't know where you went," the girl's long eyelashes trembled slightly, "but I always know how to bring you back."

Her voice became somewhat ethereal, and she murmured softly, "If I take the undefeated spirit... and release those millions of evil spirits, will you come back?"

"You are so kind," her voice slowly lowered, "how could you bear to watch me cause suffering to living beings and make the people unable to live in peace?"

"I am so bad."

"So come back soon... and kill me."

- I miss you.

- No matter what.

- Come back.

= = 

Xia Ge savored the cool taste of the mint candy melting on her tongue, feeling satisfied. She felt like her dizzy head had become much clearer.

Mao Qing glanced at Xia Ge and elbowed Huo Bai, "Is there any left?"

Huo Bai resisted, "No!"

Mao Qing said, "You're lying! I saw several pieces just now! Why are you so stingy?"

Huo Bai: "..."

In the end, Huo Bai reluctantly gave some candy to Mao Qing.

Mao Qing bit on the candy, feeling great, and her attitude changed in an instant. "Huo Bai, you're such a good person."
Summer Song laughed with a "puh" while chewing on her candy.

"This is a good person card," she said.

"I'll treat you to food next time," Summer Song said with a smile to Huo Bai, "Thank you."

Huo Bai tried to make a final struggle, "No need, it's not mine."

Mao Qing blinked, looking as if she understood everything. "Oh, we all know it's not yours. Real men don't eat candy, hehehe."

Huo Bai's face turned red again. He was about to argue, but suddenly heard the serious voice of a Danfeng inner disciple on the stage, "Start the furnace!"

The competition was about to begin.

With the refreshing mint candy, although her physical condition was very poor, Summer Song could hold on a little longer. She bit on the candy, steadied her mind, lit the furnace according to the steps, and finally checked the medicinal materials.

Although Huo Bai was holding back his anger, he didn't say anything more. After lighting the furnace, he glanced at Summer Wu Yin, whose hair was scattered and whose black robe was tattered. He couldn't see her original face anymore. Her soft black hair was draped over her shoulders, and she didn't wear the red hairband that Danfeng required, which made her look a bit messy. Huo Bai frowned slightly because he vaguely smelled a hint of blood from her.

The other party was counting the medicinal materials with a frown. Just as Huo Bai was about to withdraw his gaze and prepare to refine the pill, the black-haired youth seemed to have noticed something wrong. He scratched his head, turned sideways, placed a piece of silver wire charcoal on the scale, and weighed it again. The orange-red flames in the furnace reflected his pale face with a false rosy glow. But Huo Bai saw the broken and blood-red sacrificial robe exposed through the folds of his black robe when he turned sideways.

The sacrificial robe was dyed red with blood.

Huo Bai's pupils shrank slightly, and he subconsciously looked at the boy's face. The youth named Summer Wu Yin had already weighed the silver wire charcoal, chewed on the candy, tilted his head, and seemed to be thinking about something. The bright flames in the furnace shone on his pale cheeks. In those eyes that reflected the flames, there was anguish and contemplation, but there was no hint of pain or the expected strangeness.

He was bleeding.

-Don't you feel anything?

The smell of blood seemed to be getting stronger.

Perhaps sensing his gaze, the boy with scattered hair looked up after weighing the silver wire charcoal and met his strange eyes. He blinked, touched his face, and looked confused, as if he was wondering why Huo Bai was staring at him. After thinking for a while, he suddenly realized, pounded his hand, and smiled brightly on his pale face.

"Don't look at me like that, Brother Huo! Don't worry! I'll treat you to a meal after the competition! Don't worry!"

Huo Bai: "......"

Huo Bai turned his face with a sense of grievance.

Who asked you to treat me to a meal?!
Does it have anything to do with him if this person died from blood loss?!

Who knows, within half a minute of turning around, Mao Qing's voice was heard, "Wait until I get the first place and I'll treat you to a meal. Your candy is really delicious!"

Huo Bai: "......"

I already said that it's not my candy!

Bring it up again and I'll have you all slaughtered!

The voice of the inner door disciple on the stage was clear, "Alright! Get ready to finish! The competition starts now!"

The competition began!

In an instant, the entire Dan Training Field was bustling with activity, and everyone began throwing medicinal herbs into the furnace. For a while, smoke filled the air and various disciples displayed their skills.

On the platform to the east, Chu Yao held her sword, her eyebrows slightly furrowed.

Xiao Qing, who was beside her, could see clearly that her young miss had been staring at the black-clad youth who suddenly appeared.

She couldn't help but speak up, "Young Miss... are you looking at that person named Xia Wu Yin?"

Since that young man named Xia Wu Yin appeared, the young lady had been staring at him until now. Was there anything special about him?

The girl in blue and white sword clothes pursed her lips and made a sound, her light brown pupils reflecting a faint light. After a while, she suddenly said, "He shouldn't have come here."

He? Who?... Xia Wu Yin?

Xiao Qing guessed, "Do you mean... he doesn't have the talent for alchemy?"

Chu Yao was a little impatient, "Who knows if he has that talent or not."

Xiao Qing was confused, "Then..."

Chu Yao paused, "His eyes are not suitable."

Xiao Qing: "???"
 
Chu Yao didn't explain further, she just couldn't help but recall the scene of their last encounter.

She had anticipated being tricked, and the name Xia Ge was probably just a way to deceive her.
However, Chu Yao was not thinking about this.

During their last confrontation, when Xia Wuyin saved the child, there was pity in his eyes amidst his anger.

Because of pity, he was angry for justice, and because of compassion, he fought for the weak.

Chu Yao held his sword and looked in the direction of the black-haired youth, his light brown eyes darkening.

Even if he wanted to.

--He was destined to not live an ordinary life in the alchemy furnace.

Conquering for the sake of his compassion was the path he would take in the future.

Completely unaware that others had already imagined him as a superhero, Xia Ge was slowly and methodically throwing the medicinal herbs into the furnace according to the order.

Beside him, Huo Bai was more casual, tossing the herbs into the furnace carelessly, as if he had no sense of competition. On the other side, Mao Qing was staring at the furnace, her beautiful big eyes almost bulging out, with cold sweat on her forehead, nervous to the extreme.

Xia Ge found it interesting and couldn't help but complain to the system, "Hey, they're like two extremes, it's really funny."

System: "...please be serious, thank you."

"Little puppet, cheer me on." Xia Ge grinned, but his movements paused slightly. The mint candy in his mouth had already been chewed and swallowed, leaving a faint cool sensation on his tongue, but it couldn't resist the faint dizziness.

System perfunctorily said, "Oh, yeah, they're extreme, so amazing, so fun."

Xia Ge: "...forget it, just shut up."

The dizziness became heavier and the concept of time seemed to become blurred.

Xia Ge's movements were slightly sluggish, and she thought about it. "Little puppet."

System: "Hmm?"

"Can you give me that kind of second-hand sound, the kind that goes 'drip drip'?" After throwing the herbs, Xia Ge propped up the table with one hand, feeling as if everything in front of her had split into two, becoming powerful beyond measure.

System: "...okay."

The sound of the second hand ticking "drip" sounded in her ears, one second, one sound, one pause. Xia Ge regained her composure, timed it, and picked up the weighed glass wood, her hand trembling slightly.

"Drip."
"Drip."

There was a five-second pause...almost.

Just as Xia Ge had thrown the glassy wood into the furnace, everything went black again. She dug her fingers into the corner of the table, feeling the sharp edge press against her palm and the slight pain it brought. After a moment, she felt like someone was watching her and instinctively looked up.

Her mind was still spinning, thinking about the next ingredient in half a minute...

Thirty drips.

"Drip--"

"Drip--"

So, who was watching her just now?

Ye Ze...?

Xia Ge saw Gu Peiju, dressed in a Dan Feng plain robe, sitting quietly at the table in the north. Ye Ze was next to the girl, staring at her, seemingly noticing that she wasn't in the right state of mind, his eyes showing a hint of anxiety.

Xia Ge smiled at him.

--Don't worry, I'll win.

Her gaze shifted to the side, where Gu Peiju's black hair was tied up with a red hairband. She seemed to be looking in her direction, yet not really. Her expression was calm and her posture elegant.

...Senior Sister.

Even though they were far apart and Gu Peiju might not have been looking at her, Xia Ge felt like she could see into her eyes.

When she thought this, those dark eyes seemed to belong to her alone.

The light inside them was quiet and gentle.
