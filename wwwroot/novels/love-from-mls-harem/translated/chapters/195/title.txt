Chapter 191: I Don't Like It

The protagonist of the novel, Xiaoyu, was sitting in her room, staring blankly at the wall. She had just finished reading the latest chapter of her favorite novel, but something about it didn't sit right with her.

"I don't like it," she muttered to herself. "Why did the author have to make the main character so weak? And why did they have to kill off my favorite side character?"

Xiaoyu sighed and leaned back in her chair. She had been translating novels for years now, and she had seen her fair share of bad writing. But this one just didn't sit right with her.

She knew that she had a responsibility to her readers to provide them with accurate translations, but she didn't want to promote a novel that she didn't believe in.

After much deliberation, Xiaoyu made the difficult decision to stop translating the novel. She knew that some of her readers would be disappointed, but she couldn't continue to support something that she didn't like.

As she closed her laptop, Xiaoyu felt a sense of relief wash over her. She knew that there were plenty of other novels out there that were worthy of her time and energy, and she was excited to find them.
