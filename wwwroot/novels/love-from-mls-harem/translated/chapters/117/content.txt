The two of them ended up fighting. Xia Ge, considering herself a noble soul, didn't want to use dirty tricks against a child like Ye Ze. Although Ye Ze had lived as a wanderer for a long time, he still believed himself to be an upright and noble young master, and felt that he shouldn't resort to underhanded tactics. As a man, he believed in fighting fair and square.

In the end, they ended up exchanging punches and kicks. As children, they didn't have much strength, so at most they pulled each other's hair and clothes, or slapped each other's faces. Before long, they both had bruises and swollen faces. The instigator of the fight, the bun, was thrown to the side by Xia Ge, who now had red eyes from the fight. They both lost their appetite and quickly grew tired. Eventually, they lay on the ground, panting heavily.

Xia Ge thought to herself that she had lost her temper and that it would be more dignified to just take her bun back and leave, rather than stooping to the level of an ignorant child.

However, she was too tired and sore to move.

"Why did you steal my bun?" The young boy's voice was hoarse. "You jerk."

Xia Ge was taken aback. It was actually this little brat who had stolen her bun first. It seemed like he was the bully here.

Was there no justice in the world?

"You stole it first! You stole mine!" Xia Ge retorted, unable to swallow her anger. But she was really too exhausted to fight anymore.

The young boy, Ye Ze, was furious. "You're accusing me! I didn't move from here!"

Xia Ge sneered back. "Who would believe you when you just say you didn't move? Do you think I'm a Super Saiyan or something?!"

She had no idea what a Super Saiyan was, but she knew that Ye Ze was asking for a beating.

Ye Ze got up to attack her, but Xia Ge used a sweeping leg to trip him and he fell face down on the ground, almost knocking his teeth out.

But as he got up, Xia Ge suddenly felt that something was off. He seemed to be a little taller than the boy in the black shirt from earlier...

Xia Ge had a bad feeling about this.

Ye Ze was in pain from the fall and couldn't get up. Xia Ge looked at the bun that had been thrown to the ground. It was clearly from the same bun shop as hers, with eight folds. Otherwise, she wouldn't have mistaken it for hers.
... Is that right? It really is eight pleats on the buns.

She wasn't sure and asked, "Are those your buns?"

Ye Ze fell and hurt himself, unable to get up, filled with shame. He gritted his teeth and said, "Yes, they're mine!"

Xia Ge asked, "You didn't steal them?"

Ye Ze hesitated for a moment and said, "A gentleman loves money and has a proper way of getting it."

Finally, feeling that his words lacked impact, he exploded, "You motherf***er, you're the one who stole them! Your whole family steals! These buns were given to me by someone else! You stole them! Your whole family steals!"

Xia Ge replied, "My whole family doesn't steal. I don't have a family, and I don't steal either."

Ye Ze was speechless.

"But someone did steal my buns."

It seemed like he was mistaken?

Xia Ge said apologetically, "That person looked a lot like you, and they just walked past here."

Ye Ze, still lying on the ground after being tripped by Xia Ge, said angrily, "Mind your own business."

Xia Ge picked up the buns from the ground and wiped them off before handing them to Ye Ze, saying honestly, "I'm sorry."

Ye Ze was still lying on the ground, humiliated and turned his head away.

Xia Ge looked at the bite marks on the buns.

After a while, Xia Ge said seriously, "I'll compensate you."

Ye Ze still hadn't gotten up and didn't say anything.

Xia Ge asked, "Why are you still lying down?"

Where did the culprit get the face to speak?!

Ye Ze gritted his teeth and said, "Get lost!"

"I still haven't returned your buns to you yet."
Ye Ze: "Get lost, I don't need your help!"

Xia Ge didn't leave, as if she wouldn't give up until she got an answer. She had the nerve to say, "Then why don't you stand up?"

Ye Ze: "......"

A long time passed.

This alley was very secluded, and there weren't many people passing by. Naturally, there was no one to ask for help. Even if they found someone, they might not help a fallen beggar. No, no one would help a fallen beggar.

When his father was alive, he often said... "Those who understand the current situation are wise."

Ye Ze heard his own humiliating voice.

"...I don't have the strength."

Xia Ge scratched her hair, reached out to help Ye Ze up, then opened the steamed bun and kept the half she had bitten, giving the other half to Ye Ze, and said seriously, "I'm sorry, I was wrong."

"I'll give you a whole steamed bun next time."

Who the hell cares about your whole steamed bun?

Ye Ze thought of the inexplicable punch he had received on his face when he saw the steamed bun, feeling aggrieved, "You eat it yourself."

Xia Ge said seriously, "I don't want to eat alone. My mom said it's not good."

Ye Ze choked up, feeling that his young heart had been deceived, "Isn't your family just you?!"

Xia Ge: "But I didn't come from a rock."

Ye Ze: "......"

Alright.

In the end, Ye Ze was really too hungry and weak to argue with Xia Ge anymore, and they ended up splitting the steamed bun in half.

He regained a bit of strength.
Xia Ge asked, "Since it wasn't you, did you see someone who looks like you pass by just now?"

Xia Ge saw the thief who stole her baozi pass by from here.

Ye Ze remained silent for a moment and said, "The person you are talking about, just passed by here... I know him."

Xia Ge looked at him in surprise.

Ye Ze asked, "Did he steal your baozi?"

Xia Ge nodded.

Ye Ze said, "I'll take you to find him."

Xia Ge said, "Ah? You're so kind."

Ye Ze sneered, "You need to get your baozi back, and you need to give it back to me."

Xia Ge said, "..."

Ye Ze and Xia Ge found the baozi thief.

In front of a bunch of stray cats.

The stray cats were all dirty, but the little thief shared half of his baozi with them. He held the other half and slowly nibbled on it. A few gentle green-eyed black cats rubbed against his ankles affectionately, creating a harmonious scene.

Xia Ge watched from afar for a while.

Ye Ze said, "He's Ah Long, also a beggar here. That black cat was left to him by his sister, and it's the leader of the stray cats in this area."

After a while, Xia Ge said, "You did this on purpose, didn't you?"

Ye Ze sneered, "You asked me to bring you here, and I did. Now go up and ask that kid for your baozi!"

After a moment of silence, Xia Ge really went up, much to the surprise of Ye Ze.

She beat up the person named Ah Long, and then took back the half-eaten baozi with bruises and swelling on her face.

Xia Ge handed the bitten half of the baozi to Ye Ze and said, "Here's half of it back."
Ye Ze: "I don't want to!"

He had a visible expression of "he's so pitiful," "don't you have a conscience," and "how can you do this."

Xia Ge didn't pay attention and carefully put away the steamed buns. "If you don't want them, forget it."

She was about to leave after speaking.

"…You, stop!" Ye Ze was unwilling. "How can you have no compassion? He..."

...Compassion?

Xia Ge almost thought this beggar was telling a joke.

"He stole my things." Xia Ge stopped and looked back at Ye Ze. "No matter what the reason, he's a robber."

Ye Ze was stunned.

Xia Ge saw that he didn't understand and raised an eyebrow. "You don't understand...okay, let me give you a simple example."

Why was this person like a little young master who didn't know anything?

"If someone killed your parents because your parents killed his family."

Ye Ze seemed to be poked at some painful point, and his whole body froze, his face turning pale.

Xia Ge spoke softly. "Would you care why he killed your parents?"

Ye Ze: "..."

"You wouldn't." Xia Ge affirmed. "You would only think about revenge for yourself."

-Yes, he wanted revenge.

He dreamed about it.

Ye Ze clenched his fists, his eyes turning red.

"If you do something wrong, you should receive the appropriate punishment. He didn't think about his sister when he stole someone else's steamed buns for a stray cat. Why should I hesitate because of compassion for the sister of a robber when I take back my own things?"

Xia Ge sneered. "You only think he's very pitiful."
"But you wouldn't think, what if the person who was robbed starved to death because of that one steamed bun."

"If you truly pity him, then you shouldn't indulge him."

-The person who committed the sin.

-Should go to hell!

-Never forgive!!

Seeing Ye Ze trembling with excitement all over, Xia Ge felt like she had gone too far.

Actually, she didn't want to speak so harshly.

It was just that the other side had taken her for granted as a saint, which made her a little unhappy.

She was almost starving to death herself, how could she still care about others.

But this kind of saintly person was really rare to come by.

Ye Ze suddenly said, "...give me the steamed bun."

Xia Ge was taken aback, thought for a moment, and gave him half of the steamed bun.

With red eyes, Ye Ze wolfed down the half of the steamed bun and choked, "I don't pity him!! He deserves it! He deserves it!"

Xia Ge: "..."

Hey, your change is a bit scary...if he deserves it, then he deserves it, what's the point of a boy crying.

But...

He wasn't just a piece of rotten wood.

Maybe he was a really good person.

Xia Ge said seriously, "Since we've shared the steamed bun, we're good buddies now. What's your name?"

You can forget it, who the f*** wants to be your good buddy.

Ye Ze finished the steamed bun and still felt indignant, "What's your name?"
Xia Ge said, "Ah, Xia... Wu Yin."

Ye Ze looked at her suspiciously.

Xia Ge adjusted her complexion. Although her swollen face made it difficult to see her expression clearly, she still expressed her seriousness, "My name is Xia Wu Yin."

Ye Ze said, "Oh."

Ye Ze asked, "Do you really have no one else in your family?"

Xia Ge replied, "Why would I lie to you? Do I have money to spend?"

Xia Ge asked, "You haven't told me your name yet."

Ye Ze reluctantly said, "...Ye Ze."

Ye Ze? This name sounds familiar... like Long Aotian or something?

"Ye Ze... ah?"

Xia Ge suddenly stiffened, and the next moment, a mechanical voice sounded in her ear!

[Ding! Puppet system activating——]

[Welcome host to the world of books, the Wind and Moon Continent! No. 003 system Invincible Puppet is at your service!]

Xia Ge's eyes went blank.

Ye Ze looked at her strangely, "...What's wrong with you?"

Xia Ge thought she was hallucinating because she was hungry, "Ah, it's nothing... I think."

[Host level 0, obtained title: Marionette]
