The evil spirits were on the rise, and rumors about the Chang family were getting worse and worse. Many righteous people were incited by the rumors and demanded that the Chang family produce the Sky Illumination to ease their concerns.

In the main hall of the Chang family, Chang Ren, the head of the family, was all smiles. "What a rare guest! I didn't expect my in-law to have time to visit. It's truly an honor. I was busy a few days ago and couldn't attend the ceremony in person, so I apologize for that."

Chu Yi placed the tea on the table and smiled politely. "As the head of the family, you are my senior, and I am a junior. The ceremony is a small matter, and you need not worry about it."

Chu Yi had become the head of the family, so according to tradition, there was a ceremony to congratulate her, and each family should send someone to pay their respects.

The two of them smiled at each other and chatted about other things over tea. They seemed friendly on the surface, but there were many hidden knives and swords as they tested each other.

When they talked about Chu Zhan, Chang Ren's face darkened slightly. "Your father's sudden departure left the burden of the Chu family on your shoulders, which must not be easy. If there is anything you are not clear about, I will help you. You need not worry too much."

Chu Yi sneered inwardly. The old fox was not satisfied with just coveting Chu Dao's sacrificial spirit, but also wanted to take advantage of her youth and manipulate her like a puppet?

"There are indeed some things in the family that are worrying..." Chu Yi sighed lightly, but seeing no change in the old man's expression, she sneered inwardly. "But they are not very serious. However, as you know, there are some ambitious people in the family who are concerned about the safety of the people. I heard that you have issued a call for heroes, and they are eager to help. When my sister got married, we were short of manpower, so how can we allow these people to be reckless?"

As Chu Yi spoke, she seemed genuinely worried, with her delicate eyebrows slightly furrowed. "But recently, there have been rumors that if the Sky Illumination is used, the evil spirits will be pacified, and many righteous people with lofty ideals have come to request that you use the Sky Illumination to ease the people's concerns."

"But you have been closed to visitors these past few days, and our engagement has been the talk of the town, so many people have come to me. Out of respect for them, I can only bring some small gifts and bother you here."

Chang Ren remained silent.

Chu Yi was not in a hurry and continued to drink tea. The delicate porcelain cover gently lifted the mist, and after a while, she smiled lightly. "I heard that the Chang family values righteousness above all else and always acts with integrity. It is precisely because of this that my father thought of marrying my sister to your family."

The implication was that if the Sky Illumination was not produced, this marriage would be difficult to proceed.

Chang Ren paused for a moment and said calmly, "Speaking of this marriage... your father and I arranged it more than ten years ago."

He sighed, "Those days were truly carefree."

Although his words were full of nostalgia, Chu Yi was not foolish and could hear the hidden meaning behind them.

"When your father and I arranged this marriage, you were not even born yet, a little girl who had not yet grown up. What qualifications do you have to meddle in our affairs?"

"I suppose our fathers were also close friends back then," Chu Yi said nonchalantly, then added with some sadness, "But my father has already passed away..."
She let out a sigh, "But my late father always put righteousness first, and he often spoke highly of you. When I was young, I admired your sense of justice deeply. My sister is also satisfied with this marriage proposal."

Chang Ren listened and smiled slightly.

Chu Yi spoke with deep emotions, "But precisely because of this, my sister also hopes that you can use your brilliance to ease the worries of the people and also comfort our old family servants who are worried about the people and want to join the Heroes Alliance."

"Moreover, I have heard that Senior issued a Heroes Alliance notice a few days ago, which is really worrying about the people and the nation. After hearing about it, I was very happy."

Chu Yi's words were not too light or too heavy, although full of admiration and appreciation, Chang Ren still heard some sarcasm in it.

But looking at the other's expression, he didn't see anything inappropriate.

He vaguely ignored the tone of the other party and sighed, "The matter of the Heroes Alliance has been too busy recently. That little witch Qin Shuang is really cunning. It's not that I don't want to ease the worries of the people, but the brilliance of the heavens is something that has been kept in storage. If it is taken out casually and stolen by someone who is already prepared, it will really not be worth it."

Chu Yi smiled, "What you said is true."

"But don't worry, after a few days, I will summon heroes from all over and take down that witch. After there are no worries, I will naturally use the brilliance of the heavens to eliminate the evil spirits for the people."

Chu Yi paused, and a hint of coldness flashed in her deep pupils, but it was deeply hidden by her smile. She put down her tea, "Then I will wait for Senior's good news."

People left, and the tea was cold.

A gloomy voice sounded in Chang Ren's ear, "She is testing you."

It was a bad omen.

Chang Ren didn't care, "Just a little girl, nothing to fear. But do you know where that little demon girl is hiding?"

Huo Ming said, "I share a soul with her, so naturally, I know where she is hiding-even if she turns to ashes, I know who she is."

Huo Ming's voice was suppressed and gloomy.

Even though Chang Ren had experienced countless battles, he was still tingling with goosebumps from the coldness and bloodiness of that voice. He couldn't help but ask, "Why are you so obsessed with her?"

Huo Ming chuckled softly.

From the moment it was born.

It was destined to live with this person on the bloody and painful road.

"This is our fate."
Chang Ren didn't speak, but he thought back to the time a few years ago when he had personally given this clothes demon to that child...

The girl's smile always carried a bit of silly innocence. She wanted to tug at his clothes, but was too afraid to do so. She could only stand timidly behind him, her voice small.

"-Father...Uncle, I, I can't find my mother..."

People are not made of stone.

She was also his child.

However, just as he was about to reach out to comfort her, the voice of calamity rang out gloomily.

"...Give me this child."

"I'll give you everything you want."

The memories came to an abrupt end.

The child's smile gradually turned into a silhouette, and finally became a stepping stone for his desires to be satisfied.

And the unrelenting fate of calamity.

Chang Ren was lost in thought for a moment, but quickly came back to his senses. He said, "Since you can find her, let's take action earlier."

Once you choose a path to take, there is no talk of regret or no regret.

He paused and chuckled, "That little girl from the Chu family is coming over. She probably knows something... Let's take action earlier, capture her, and say that the Skyshine Jewel was stolen and hidden by Qin Shuang when it was released in the Heroes' List."

Calamity sneered, "The person is mine."

Chang Ren said casually, "Naturally, she is yours. I just need a 'name'."

He paused and asked again, "Are you sure the person who is stopping you is Gu Peijiu?"

When calamity heard this name, he gritted his teeth and said, "I know her even if she turns to ashes!"

Upon hearing this, Chang Ren pondered for a moment, then curved his index finger and tapped the table.

Soon, a servant came in, bowing respectfully.

Chang Ren took a sip of tea and said in a calm voice, "Go and send a message to Lingxi Peak. Just say... they have found the missing Danfeng disciple."
The ominous laughter echoed: "This is interesting..."

Over here.

Chuyi walked out of the Chang family's gate and waved off the servant who had seen her off. She took out a letter from her pocket, her gaze filled with a deep chill. 

The Martial Arts Tournament... Hmph.

Completely unaware of the approaching storm, Xia Ge and her senior sister were still living a peaceful life on the mountain.

"Senior sister, I made hawthorn cakes for you today!"

In the small kitchen, Xia Ge rolled up her sleeves, eager to give it a try.

Gu Peiju was reading a book in the courtyard. Upon hearing her, she replied nonchalantly, "Don't cut your hand."

The next second.

Xia Ge exclaimed, "Ah... I'm bleeding!"

In a flash, a white figure appeared beside her. Gu Peiju pinched her wrist and stared at her unharmed hand, saying, "..."

Xia Ge blinked and then leaned her head against Gu Peiju's chest, listening to her pounding heart. She nodded in satisfaction, "Hmm, I was just fooling you."

Gu Peiju: "..."

Xia Ge said, "Am I shameless for doing this?"

System: "Yes."

Before Gu Peiju could speak, Xia Ge said, "I feel weird for fooling you like that."

She kissed Gu Peiju's cheek and asked, "Can you forgive me?"

"Um..." Gu Peiju rubbed her head and said, "I don't blame you."

"That's not important," Xia Ge shook her head. "Have you heard the story of 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf'?"
Gu Peijiu frowned and shook her head.

Xia Ge chuckled to herself, thinking that even if her senior sister was knowledgeable, she probably hadn't heard of Aesop's fables.

"...It's probably just a child who likes to lie. In the end, no one believes him even when he tells the truth."

Xia Ge pretended to sympathize, "Later, the wolf really came and because no one believed him, he was eaten."

Gu Peijiu looked at her.

Xia Ge lowered her head and hugged her, "Senior sister, will you always believe me like you did just now?"

Gu Peijiu was slightly taken aback, then smiled as if she had heard something funny.

The lingering scent of sandalwood dissipated.

Gu Peijiu touched her head and sighed lightly, "You."

Xia Ge asked eagerly, "Will you, senior sister?"

Then she quickly reassured her, "I won't go too far, I don't like lying to people, really."

System: "..."

Gu Peijiu asked, "What are you worried about?"

Xia Ge was caught off guard by Gu Peijiu's sudden question.

She was stunned for a moment and said embarrassedly, "...I guess I just wanted to ask."

Gu Peijiu looked at her and said, "I don't think you need to ask me this question."

Xia Ge was slightly taken aback.

She sighed lightly, "But since you asked, it means you still can't completely trust me."

Xia Ge started to protest, but her lips were sealed by a gentle kiss that made her feel particularly at ease.
Summer Song felt dizzy and disoriented from the kiss, lost in a foggy cloud. She faintly heard Gu Peijiu's shallow breath next to her ear, "Even if you deceive me a hundred times..."

"...On the 101st time, I will still believe you."

Summer Song and Gu Peijiu were "sharing" hawthorn cake when an unexpected guest arrived. With half a piece of cake in her hand, Summer Song opened the door and came face to face with the visitor's dark eyes. He tried to enter, but Summer Song ruthlessly slammed the door shut.

Summer Song thought to herself, "He deserved to be shut out!"

Ye Ze touched his nose and stood at the door, neither coming in nor leaving. Summer Song looked over to the yard and saw Gu Peijiu reading peacefully, with a beautiful girl lying tiredly on a chair next to her. Her black hair was like ink, and she looked perfect except for a suspicious tooth mark on the crimson hawthorn cake in her hand.

Summer Song knew at a glance that she had bitten into it.

Hers!

Gu Peijiu raised her eyebrows and, when Summer Song approached, bit into the spot where the tooth mark had been, without a word.

Summer Song walked over in frustration and snatched Gu Peijiu's book away. "Who is that outside the door?" she asked.

Gu Peijiu looked at her calmly, but her eyes held a hint of understanding. "Don't you know him, Xia Xia?"

Summer Song replied, "I know a lot of people! I even know Nüwa and Gonggong! Even if the Jade Emperor came down to see me, it wouldn't be at this moment!"

"Don't play games with me," Summer Song said irritably. "What does he want?"

After a pause, she added, "Sister, you lied to me. You said you had taught him a lesson, so why is he still coming to see you?"
Gu Peiju said, "Come here."

Xia Ge walked over.

Gu Peiju put the side she had bitten into her own mouth into Xia Ge's mouth and asked with a slight smile, "Is it sweet?"

Xia Ge's mouth was full of hawthorn, and she nodded and shook her head at the same time, "Mm-mm."

Gu Peiju stood up, took the book from Xia Ge's hand, and turned to the page she had just read. She said in a calm voice, "It's meaningless to kill him."

Xia Ge took a bite of the hawthorn cake to vent her anger and said with a sob, "Why is it meaningless? I'm so happy... Ah!"

Where is it meaningless?

She is happy!

Gu Peiju laughed, "Killing him straightforwardly or making him apologize to you, which one would make you happier?"

Xia Ge finished the hawthorn cake and looked at her suspiciously, "What are you talking about? Apologize?"

After a pause, Gu Peiju said, "I don't need him to apologize to me. I owe him. He didn't say anything wrong when he scolded me. I just didn't like him, so I asked you to teach him a lesson. He doesn't need to apologize to me..."

Gu Peiju looked at her with gentle eyes and said, "He needs to apologize to Xia Ge."

Xia Ge was stunned for a moment and asked, "Did senior sister tell him?"

"I didn't tell him," Gu Peiju turned her gaze to the book, "But if someone really wants to know, they will tell him."

After a pause, she said in a low voice, "If not for this, I wouldn't have let him come up."

Xia Ge stood still like a wooden person and didn't say anything.

Gu Peiju sighed lightly, "If you don't want to see him, I'll kick him out."

Xia Ge hesitated and said, "Let me think about it."

It wasn't senior sister who said it... then who did?

Xia Ge couldn't figure out who could tell Ye Ze about this.
"Do you know anyone other than Senior Sister who knows that her soul is not her own?" 

"Time passed quickly, from daylight to nightfall, as if in the blink of an eye." 

"Ye Ze's black hair was covered in frost from the mountain night, but he didn't react, just stood at the door, unarmed, waiting for someone to open it for him." 

"Xia Ge nestled in Gu Peiju's arms, her eyes closed, sleeping somewhat restlessly." 

"After a while, Xia Ge murmured, 'Who else could have said it if not Senior Sister?'" 

"The system replied, 'Don't underestimate the male lead's luck... he might have met an old fortune-teller on the way.'" 

"Gu Peiju heard her murmur and paused before saying, 'I let him go.'" 

"Xia Ge opened her round eyes with a 'pop,' 'What? He left? I haven't had enough time to talk to him... I mean, I still have questions to ask him. How could Senior Sister let him go?'" 

"The system interjected, '...' Didn't you just say you wanted to keep him around for a while longer?" 

"Gu Peiju said, 'Either sleep well or go ask him yourself.'" 

"Xia Ge pouted, 'Don't you know, Senior Sister? Just tell me directly, it's easier and I don't have to move. Why go ask someone else?'" 

"She continued, 'Senior Sister is so warm.'" 

"Gu Peiju silently hugged her tighter." 

"The system felt annoyed, '... You just didn't want to move and wanted to keep him around longer, but felt guilty, so you came to Senior Sister for comfort, didn't you?!'" 

"It had to be said that the system's analysis was spot on." 

"Xia Ge chose to ignore it." 

"She quietly asked, 'Senior Sister, who told him?'" 

"Gu Peiju didn't say anything." 

"Of course, she knew who had told him." 

"In this world, besides her, only Su Chan probably knew the identity of this person's past life."
Just like how Su Chan resents her, she also doesn't want to bring up that name.

Gu Peijiu thought for a moment, kissed her forehead, and said, "Sleep."

Xia Ge: "......"

Xia Ge was about to erupt, but suddenly her lips were kissed and a jade-like hand slipped in. Gu Peijiu whispered in her ear, "Today, you're on top."

Xia Ge immediately went weak in the knees, flipped over and pinned down Gu Peijiu. She forgot about everything and kissed her passionately.

The red curtains rolled.

Sleep?

No way.

Do it first and then sleep!

---

The next day.

Xia Ge had worked too hard the day before and slept until midday.

When she woke up, her senior sister was already reading in the study.

She rubbed her eyes and felt like she had forgotten something. She looked outside and her face turned red.

The lingerie was washed clean and hung on the clothesline, along with two bras.

The wind blew and the lingerie fluttered in the sunlight, fully exposing Xia Ge's laziness.

Xia Ge: "......"

She changed her clothes and quickly ran to the study. "Senior sister, did you wash the clothes?"

Gu Peijiu replied, "Just washed them casually."

How could Xia Ge, such a hardworking girl, be a parasite in the organization?

Xia Ge enthusiastically said, "I'll wash them next time."
Gu Peijiu raised her eyes and looked at her with a smile that wasn't really a smile. "The sun has already set by the time you wake up."

Xia Ge: "..."

She closed the book and smiled at her. "You worked hard yesterday."

"Not really..." Xia Ge blushed and slammed the door to the study from the outside, looking at the swaying bellybands in the courtyard. "What did I forget to do?"

The system said subtly, "At the door."

Xia Ge suddenly realized and knocked on the door. "Oh, Ye Ze, let's talk about it tonight."

The system: "..."

Are you doing this on purpose?

Xia Ge looked at the bellybands in the courtyard and said subtly, "It's not good if someone sees it."

The system, who knew Xia Ge's bad nature, sneered, "You're talking as if you're planning to invite someone in."

In the evening, Xia Ge confidently opened the courtyard door.

Ye Ze was covered in dew and frost. He heard the "creak" sound of the door opening, and when he looked up, he saw a girl in black clothes slam the door shut from the outside, as if she was afraid he would see something.

Xia Ge stood on the blue stone steps at the door, still swinging a dog-tail grass in her hand. "As the saying goes, nothing happens three times. Ye Xiaogongzi... oh no, the pride of the Sword Peak, what business do you have with me?"

Ye Ze moved his lips, but with the person right in front of him, he didn't know what to say.

He carefully looked at the girl in front of him.

She was a little thinner than before, but her complexion had improved a lot. Her black clothes outlined her perfect figure, and the black belt around her waist outlined the white cloud pattern, making the girl look very elegant.

He thought of what Su Chan had told him.

"...her soul is within reach."

"But people always like to be blinded by rumors and their own eyes."
Ye Ze remained silent for a long time.

Xia Ge grew impatient. She didn't waste her precious time flirting with her senior just to have this person play a game of rock-paper-scissors with her.

Xia Ge threw the dog-tail grass in her hand to the ground and turned around. "Do you have something to say? If not, I'll go back."

The boy's voice was hoarse. "Thank you."

Xia Ge put her hand on the doorknob but didn't move. "Why are you thanking me? Have I done anything worthy of your gratitude?"

It was plain and simple, but it sounded a bit piercing.

"You're Xia Ge, right?" Ye Ze didn't know how to talk to this person.

To him, this was a person who was both very familiar and completely unfamiliar.

Xia Ge casually said, "It doesn't matter what you call me. As long as you're happy."

Ye Ze said, "Then let's stick with Xia Wu Yin."

Xia Ge's hand on the doorknob tightened slightly, and her whole body tensed up as if she had been poked at something.

...The person who had turned the name "Xia Wu Yin" into a name that people avoided like the plague was now calling her by that name.

No matter how you thought about it, it had a bit of a mocking tone.

Ye Ze also noticed Xia Ge's discomfort. He pursed his lips and said, "I...take back everything I said before."

Xia Ge tightly gripped the doorknob and wanted to smash something in his face, and then tell him word by word what "what's done is done" meant.

But then she thought that "what's done is done" might be like "the boy who cried wolf," and there might not be such a saying here.

"...I know it's too simple to say that." Ye Ze said, "I came here...not expecting you to forgive me, but just wanting to tell you that I know I was wrong."

"I, Ye Ze, am a person who takes responsibility for his own actions." Ye Ze said, "I will find a way to repay what I owe you - I know what you want to do."

"As for Chu Shi-jie, I won't let the Chang family have their way...you can rest assured."

Xia Ge suddenly said, "Ye Ze."

Ye Ze closed his mouth and waited for her to speak.
"...Do you always think you're right?"

The girl turned her head slightly, the evening sun shining in her eyes, a cold indifference on her face. "I always believe my ideas are correct."

Ye Ze clenched his fists, saying nothing.

"Do you think you only owe me this much?" She looked into his dark eyes. "I came here because of you. I became a puppeteer because I saved you. And because you broke your leg, I endure the torment of evil spirits every day..."

"Before, although I felt pain, I still thought it was worth it for you."

She walked up to Ye Ze, pressing her hand against her chest and staring at him. "...So you probably will never understand what it feels like to have the person you trust most choke you."

"I can tell you," Xia Ge slowly descended the stone steps, her gaze icy. "I won't forgive you. No matter what you do."

Ye Ze looked at her, his Adam's apple moving as he struggled to speak.

Xia Ge reached out and hooked her hand around his chin, smiling with narrowed eyes. "Also, I thought about it. You should call me Xia Ge. After all...the Xia Wu Yin who could drink and chat with you, she's been dead for a long time."
