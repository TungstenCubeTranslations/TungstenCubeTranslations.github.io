Chapter 188 Long Time No See

It had been a long time since they last saw each other. As they stood face to face, memories flooded back to them.

"You haven't changed a bit," she said with a smile.

"Neither have you," he replied, returning the smile.

They had been childhood friends, but life had taken them on different paths. It wasn't until now, years later, that they had the chance to catch up.

Over cups of tea, they talked about their lives, their dreams, and their struggles. They laughed and reminisced about old times, and shared their hopes for the future.

As the sun began to set, they said their goodbyes, promising to keep in touch and not let so much time pass before seeing each other again.

As they walked away, they both felt a sense of warmth and comfort knowing that their friendship had stood the test of time.
