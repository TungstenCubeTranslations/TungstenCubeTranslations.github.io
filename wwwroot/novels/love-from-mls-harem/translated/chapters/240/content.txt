"Clang!"

Swords clashed!

Charging towards Ye Ze, Chang Jian sneered, "You're still lacking! Little brat, taste this!"

As he spoke, Chang Jian flipped his long sword, and an indescribable sinister aura instantly enveloped them. Ye Ze shuddered, and the radiance of the sky shone, blocking the sinister aura. However, the impact of that aura caused him to tumble in the air and fall to the ground. Ye Ze took a moment to catch his breath, and the sinister aura, with Chang Jian as the center, spread out in all directions!

The people who were previously clamoring became quiet after the aura spread.

From clamor to suffocating silence, it only took a moment.

Ye Ze looked around and suddenly widened his eyes.

The people who were previously condemning Chang Jian were now staring blankly, as if their souls had been taken away!

The maids around Chu Yi were also soulless and dazed!

What's going on?! Where's Chu Yi?!

Ye Ze instinctively looked towards Chu Yi and breathed a sigh of relief, but was also surprised.

A small object on Chu Yi's chest was emitting black mist, and a small cluster of black mist surrounded her, but was enveloped in a golden light. The silver butterflies around her flew, blocking the sinister aura. Her black eyes were bright and seemed normal.

That is...

Ye Ze was somewhat familiar with the aura, but also unfamiliar.

Chu Yi glanced around. Although the maids around her had lost their souls, they didn't move. She was fine because...

The jade dragon horn on her chest was slightly warm.

The Ghost Dragon Jade!

Ye Ze was fine because of the Radiance of the Sky, but she was fine because of this Ghost Dragon Jade.

Seeing that Chu Yi was fine, Ye Ze breathed a sigh of relief, then gritted his teeth and asked Chang Jian, "Old thief, what did you do?!"

"What did I do? You'll see soon enough - I wonder how long you can hold on!" Chang Jian sneered, his voice ominous. "Attack!"

In an instant, the people around them, who were being controlled, moved at the sound of the command. The maids who were originally protecting Chu Yi had their eyes turn red in an instant and unsheathed their swords without hesitation towards their own master!
Just now, that aura actually controlled both the soul and body of a person!

The surrounding maids drew their swords, their eyes turning red as they swung their blades towards Chu Yi!

Chang Ren looked at the small piece of jade dragon horn on Chu Yi's chest and sneered, "Remember to grab that thing and keep her alive. She is the head of the Chu family after all."

As long as they could grab that piece of jade and control Chu Yi with the curse, they could easily manipulate the Chu family without any effort!

"Clang clang-"

Chu Yi's eyes turned cold as the Silver Butterfly spread its wings, its icy wings like sharp blades, cutting through everything in its path. The maids' short swords were as weak as mud under the butterfly's sharp wings!

The cold aura instantly spread out, and Chu Yi slowly took off her soft cloak from her shoulders and threw it on the ground, ignoring the people controlled by the curse around her. She looked up at Chang Ren with a smile on her lips, "Is that all you've got?"

"Haha, you do have some skills," Chang Ren sneered, "But don't be too happy yet!"

Ye Ze wanted to rush up to help Chu Yi, but was quickly stopped by the people controlled by the curse - they were no longer hesitant like before, and were now absolute killing machines under the curse's command!

Although the Silver Butterfly was powerful, it couldn't withstand the overwhelming crowd. Chang Ren's goal was obviously to take the Ghost Dragon Jade and control Chu Yi. He didn't attack Chu Yi, but showed no mercy towards Ye Ze, using deadly moves!

Even without any killing intent, Chu Yi was soon surrounded by the crowd!

"Although the head of the Chu family has a treasure that can dodge the 'Soul Sacrifice,' it's a pity..." Chang Ren laughed lightly, "You probably won't be able to hide for long."

The "Soul Sacrifice" was probably the sinister wind from earlier.

Chu Yi smiled, but her black eyes were filled with deep ice, "The head of the Chang family must have had many nightmares to be so delusional during the day."

Chang Ren stood up slowly, "Let me deal with that boy first, and then we can discuss the marriage between our two families-"

Ye Ze gritted his teeth, "You old thief, how despicable!"

The people surrounding them were innocent, so Ye Ze couldn't attack without restraint. He was constantly being controlled, while the other side attacked without hesitation. In no time, even with the Radiance of the Firmament protecting him, he was still injured.

Although Chu Yi looked calm, she was obviously struggling under the siege of the crowd, and the Silver Butterfly's attack speed also slowed down.

Suddenly, a maid with red eyes flashed forward, her sharp dagger grazing Chu Yi's chest. Chu Yi tilted her head back, took a step back, and the cold blade, along with the chain holding the Ghost Dragon Jade, tore through her clothes and flew into the air. Under the dazzling sunlight, the delicate and warm dragon horn was surrounded by a thin black mist, and the brilliant golden light that had protected her disappeared in an instant.
"Taken away?!"

Her mind went blank.

She forgot everything.

She even forgot to have the surrounding butterflies retrieve the jade, and instinctively reached out to grab the disappearing trace. The jade dragon horn, with its warm silver chain, brushed past her palm and was abruptly intercepted halfway by a controlled maid, who took it in her hand!

The maid's eyes were red, devoid of emotion.

With the loss of the Ghost Dragon Jade, the golden light that protected Chu Yi disappeared instantly!

A sinister smile appeared at the corner of Chang Ren's mouth, and a burst of pitch-black wind swept towards Chu Yi, who was in a daze!

Soul Sacrifice!

Chu Yi reached out to the maid and murmured, "Give it back to me."

...Her brother's dragon jade...she lost it?

Ye Ze didn't care about hurting the innocent anymore. The Sky Sword drew a blazing light blade, sweeping away the people blocking his path, "Be careful!!"

...Lost.

Couldn't find it.

Her chest was as cold as the lost heart, as if she had lost everything.

Really...had nothing.

It was like the last straw that broke the camel's back.

The cold wind was about to sweep over Chu Yi, and Ye Ze was too late, while Chang Ren's mouth curved even more sinisterly!

Chu Yi's gaze suddenly turned cold, and the silver butterflies on her sleeve suddenly exploded into countless pieces! Her voice was extremely cold -

"Die."

Anyway...everything was lost, nothing remained, so it didn't matter anymore.

"Swish-"
Brilliant Silver Butterflies!

Countless beautiful and dazzling silver butterflies rushed out of the girl's sleeve, like a rolling wave, and at the moment when the black mist approached, they exploded with a loud "boom"!

Indiscriminate attack!

Ye Ze suddenly widened his eyes. Wouldn't this indiscriminate attack also hurt Chu Yi herself?!

And besides being injured, it was useless against the "Soul Sacrifice"!

That gust of cold wind was a spiritual sacrifice, and the silver butterflies were just physical attacks! Chu Yi!

The rolling smoke and dust from the explosion of the silver butterflies covered the scene in front of Ye Ze, and he couldn't see Chu Yi's figure. Chang Ren laughed three times, "It's useless, you can't stop it! This is a soul sacrifice! You're so stupid! You can't hurt anyone!"

However, his laughter suddenly stopped because Huo Ming said, "...wait."

Warmth...

Her unfocused pupils slowly focused, and the small dragon horn swayed in her vision. In the smoke and dust of the silver butterflies, her slender and fair finger hooked on the silver chain, and under the bloody and warm liquid, it was somewhat hazy.

It was very warm.

And... bloody.

Like a long, long time ago...

She was completely embraced.

As the smoke and dust slowly dissipated, Chang Ren's voice suddenly stopped, and he looked incredulously at the scene in front of him, "How is this possible?!"

There were corpses all around, and in the middle, the brown-eyed girl's red wedding dress had already been torn apart by the silver butterfly fragments, revealing a set of battle clothes with rolling golden dragon patterns inside. She held Chu Yi with one hand and hooked the shaking silver chain with the other. The gloomy aura was completely isolated, and drops of crimson blood fell on the ground.

The exploding silver butterflies almost filled every inch of air with sharp blade-like fragments. Chu Yao actually went up against them to stop the gloomy wind! The torn wedding dress was nothing, but just to get the flying dragon horn chain and stop the gloomy wind, she even faced Chu Yi's suicidal attack in anger. Even with the protection of the Chu Sword Sacrifice Spirit, it was hard to say that she was unscathed.

...She still needed to protect her well.

The Chu Sword Sacrifice Spirit had a tassel for the Chu Sword, which could protect the body, and that tassel would be used to protect the arm holding the sword. However, Chu Yao gave the sword tassel to Xia Ge to show her intention to "abandon the sword and seal the sword". Now, the arm that was exposed to get the chain was outside the protection range of the Chu Sword Sacrifice Spirit, and under Chu Yi's suicidal attack, it was covered in wounds and oozing blood.

"...My Chu family doesn't have a single family head." Chu Yao's voice was hoarse. "It's suicide."

"Really pathetic."
Chuyi's pitch-black pupils slowly moved from the dragon horn to the pale face in front of her.

Warm tears suddenly streamed down her cheeks.

- She couldn't believe it herself.

She could also have such a weak moment in front of this person.

Hot blood rolled down drop by drop, dripping on the ground and splashing blood.

Her chest surged, Chuyi's previous blow was really strong, but fortunately, the strong yin wind was blocked by the Chudao Jiling. Chuyao endured the pain and slowly put the chain on Chuyi. Her trembling hands almost slipped several times, but she finally hooked it up and said in a slightly hoarse voice, "Why are you crying? You're so weak."

After finally putting it on, Chuyao couldn't help but "puh" and sprayed a mouthful of blood. Her entire weight leaned against Chuyi, and then her body slowly slid down and finally knelt weakly on the ground.

Chuyi was stunned and didn't even raise her hand to help her up. She couldn't even react to what had just happened.

She could only feel the slight coldness of the chain on her neck.

Chuyao knelt on the ground and said self-mockingly, "Tsk, you got what you wanted. I really... can't accept it."

Got what she wanted? What did she want?

Chuyi suddenly remembered.

- One day, I will tear off your proud skin and see the appearance of the arrogant child of heaven being torn apart and bloody.

Yes, this person knelt on the ground, although not torn apart and bloody.

But because of her, she was torn apart and bloody.

She always thought she was very smart, but at this moment, she felt really stupid.

Stupid to the extreme.

"...Why did you come here?" Chuyi felt like her brain was empty. "Why did you come here?!"

- Why are you blocking her in front of me?!

You...

Why did you...
Will she be grateful to you for doing this?!

Chu Yao held her injured arm and looked up at her, a smirk on her lips. "As the saying goes, it's the family's command, and I came to marry."

Chu Yi looked at her, took a step back, and then another step, finally unable to smile.

It was supposed to be like this, there was nothing wrong.

She wanted to see her sister, who had taken everything from her, lose everything. She wanted to see her kneel on the ground in agony. She wanted to take back the Chu family. She was full of hatred, anger, and narrow-mindedness. She had never been happy in her life!

She wanted to be happy once!

So she took over the Chu family, made Chu Yao lose her fighting spirit, and forced her to marry and give up her sword. She wanted to see Chu Yao fall into the abyss and bleed to death. She wanted to make her suffer!

Finally, as she said, she got what she wanted.

But.

The arrogant son of that day knelt in front of her, with obvious injuries and blood all over him, but she still wasn't happy.

She wasn't happy at all!!

"You... get up." Chu Yi stuttered, "How could you... be like this?"

How could she be happy?!

...Why did they have to stop her when she was about to reach her breaking point?

Why did they stop her when she was at her limit?

Why?! Who was moved by their savior act?! Was she?!

Chang Ren sneered, "Perfect timing, let's deal with both of them together!"

"Stop it, father!"

In a critical moment, Chang Nian shouted, the long wedding procession was behind them. Chu Yao saw the chain protecting Chu Yi being pulled off when they came in, and they were a step behind. The people in the wedding procession were trembling like they had red eye disease. Chang Nian got off his horse and looked around at the controlled people. "Father, what are you doing?!"

Chang Ren laughed, his eyes also red. "What am I doing?! Of course, I'm going to unify the world!"
The curse and fate had already taken hold of him, unknowingly amplifying his desires infinitely. At first, he only wanted to silence these people, but the darker his heart became, the easier it was to be amplified under the control of the curse, and eventually he would slowly speak out his deepest desires.

Xia Ge, who had already left the sedan and was hiding outside while listening at the wall and preparing the Wan Hun Pill, heard Chang Ren's words and spat out, "Unify the world? What a ridiculous dream! He's truly shameless!"

Xia Ge and Gu Peijiu were under a huge parasol tree, with the Wenqing Sword inserted on one side, and a double-layered concealment spell covering their souls and invisibility to disguise their figures. The other Wenqing Sword was to prevent being spied on by the curse.

Gu Peijiu said, "Don't be distracted."

"Okay, okay," Xia Ge said, "It'll be over soon, I'll take care of these evil spirits!"

In the courtyard, Chang Lan also dismounted, "Father, you can't do this!"

Chang Ren sneered, raised his hand and sealed the two with a spell, "Shut up! I won't tolerate any nonsense here!"

Chang Nian was shocked and frightened by the sealing spell, "Father!"

Chang Lan was also surprised, and subconsciously drew his sword to attack, but the blade pierced the barrier, creating a spark, but it was useless.

Chang Ren looked at Chu Yao kneeling not far away, as well as Chu Yi who was in a daze, and a sinister smile appeared on his lips, "Both of the Chu family's descendants are here. As long as they are controlled and the Chu family is taken down, this world will be within reach!"

Chu Yao was angry and stood up unsteadily, grabbing her injured right arm. She hissed and took a deep breath, but still stood in front of Chu Yi, coldly laughing at Chang Ren, "You're dreaming!"

"Get out of the way!" Chu Yi said, "Don't pretend to be nice to me here!"

Her tone was like that of an angry child.

She herself was stunned by her own words, gritted her teeth, and said bluntly, "My sister was indifferent to me back then, so why bother pretending to be sisters now..." Deeply in love...?

"This world belongs to no one." Chu Yao said what she should have said to Chang Ren, but she turned her head slightly and looked at Chu Yi.

Her light brown pupils reflected a faintly warm and indifferent light.

Chu Yi suddenly found it difficult to continue her words, looking at Chu Yao, speechless for a moment.

——Long, long ago.

She once let the Hundred Ghosts Cave and the Chang family make contact, and when using the Chang family to counter the Chu family, she said such a sentence.

"...As long as you are willing, take down the Chu family, and then the world will be yours."

"Don't think I don't know." Chang Ren sneered, "The reason why the Chu family has been able to sit securely in this position for five hundred years is probably not just because of the Chu Blade Sacrifice, right? The trade between your family and the 【Rank】—"
"We have no dealings with the Zhì family," Chu Yao supported her right arm and thought she had calmed Chu Yi down. She turned to Chang Ren, her gaze cold, "Even if there were dealings, it was our family ancestor's affair five hundred years ago - don't assume everyone is as despicable as you."

Even though she had suffered serious internal injuries, even though her right arm was injured, even though she didn't have the famous Chu sword in her hand, Chu Yao stood in front of Chu Yi with her back straight, her light brown eyes determined. "I'll say it again, no one in this world will ever bear our family name again!"

"My Chu family has been able to stand in the Feng Yue continent for five hundred years because we conduct ourselves with integrity and have nothing to be ashamed of!"

For a moment, Chu Yi felt that she was indeed inferior to her sister.

This kind of prideful aura, this kind of righteous and upright mindset.

She couldn't do it.
