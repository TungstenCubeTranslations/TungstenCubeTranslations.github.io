At the moment when the pill formula was formed, the world changed dramatically. The endless spiritual energy rolled and the stars shifted, forming a huge vortex in the air. Countless evil spirits attracted by the delicious fresh blood screamed and howled, being sucked into the vortex and torn into pieces by the sharp spiritual energy in the vast universe.

"Oh my god - what is that?!"

"...It's a ground-level... a ground-level alchemist!!"

Su Chan, who had returned from the Evil Spirit Basin, looked up at the dark and deep vortex in the sky and the countless evil spirits that were sucked into it. Her black eyes were unfathomable.

The lovesick feeling on her fingertips dared not move.

All the evil spirits in the Evil Spirit Mountain had been released by her.

Su Chan looked at the vortex and smiled lightly.

In this chaotic world, you won't leave.

That's great.

Xia Ge didn't know Su Chan's evaluation of her, nor did she know the other party's suffocating thinking process.

She felt that her soul body was light and fluttering, and the heavenly path was like a soft ribbon, wanting to reveal everything in front of her, but also shy to speak.

Some vague memories seemed to be getting clearer, but quickly became blurry again.

The heavenly path was within reach.

It seemed that taking one more step could unlock all the mysteries of this world, and a few more moments of indulgence could make the soul take another step forward.

However, it couldn't be done.

Xia Ge's gaze was firm.

Nothing was important.

All the chaos, all the confusion, the evil spirits' howls, people's discussions -

They were all obstacles that confused her and made her stay.

They were all unimportant.
——This is the last step!

As long as this step is completed, she can enter the ultimate state, achieve nirvana, and the Ten Thousand Souls Pill will be formed!

Xia Ge's eyes sharpened, and she was about to change the pill formula in her hand. Unexpectedly, before she could do so, her movements suddenly stopped.

Apart from her, the vortex would absorb any existence in a soul state.

Not far away, the black-clothed girl was clearly wearing a veil, but Xia Ge could still feel her gaze fixed on her.

Xia Ge's movements froze.

The vortex in the sky was huge, and countless evil spirits were being sucked up in droves. The black-clothed girl smiled slightly at her and then flew towards the vortex little by little.

The wind was fierce.

The girl's veil was blown open.

Unable to distinguish between illusion and reality, or success and failure.

Xia Ge's pupils suddenly shrank to the size of a needle, and the pill formula in her hand scattered in an instant!

"Don't!!"

The vortex in the air suddenly solidified.

And in that moment, the black-clothed girl laughed, her delicate little face suddenly becoming fierce. She opened her bloody mouth wide, and in an instant turned into a terrifying evil spirit, breaking free from the vortex's restraints and flying towards Xia Ge with bared teeth and claws!

The reason why the evil spirit would bite Xia Ge's body and not care about her soul was because the pill formula of the Ten Thousand Souls Pill would hide her soul's location and make the evil spirit think that her body and soul were together. But in that moment just now, she exposed the location of her soul!

What she had just seen was an illusion that the Heavenly Dao had blinded her with!!

Indeed...the promotion from Profound to Earth level was never as simple as she had thought!

"Every time, it's like this."

A breeze blew her soft black hair, and Su Chan looked at the loose vortex. "...It's always like this, regardless of the consequences."

"But...it's okay."

Su Chan sighed softly and moved her fingers lightly, her voice tinged with a faint smile.
"Who let it be you."

Just as Xia Ge was about to use her techniques to remedy the situation, the loose vortex seemed to be under some kind of control. In an instant, it spun even more fiercely and tore towards the demon that was attacking Xia Ge. But in the blink of an eye, it was sucked back into the vortex by a strong force and torn into pieces by the chaotic spiritual energy blades!

Why did it suddenly move again? She clearly didn't have time to use her techniques...

Xia Ge was slightly stunned, but quickly regained her composure. The vortex had already sucked in all the other miscellaneous materials, along with the demon, just right!

She quickly concentrated her mind and followed the steps in the alchemy scroll, fusing the Gathering Spirit Technique together!

In an instant, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth condensed in the sky, and the scenery for thousands of miles was brilliant and dazzling. The endless Evil Spirit Mountain seemed to have been dyed golden by the brilliant golden light in the sky. The demon's howling stopped, the clouds dispersed and two round reddish-brown pills floated in the sky. It seemed that there were phoenixes flying around the pills, happily chirping, and the phantom of a golden dragon coiling around the pills roaring. Soon, the phantom of the dragon and phoenix dissipated, replaced by ghosts and demons coming on clouds. The two small pills, in the blink of an eye, demonstrated the myriad changes of life.

They were like two suns in the dim sky, shining on all the lost souls.

Xia Ge's broken body was almost sucked into the vortex by the demon, but fortunately, the spiritual vortex formed by the alchemy techniques did not attract anything other than the soul and materials. So, at the moment it reached the vortex, it was thrown out like a torn cloth bag and landed on a mountain top.

Xia Ge returned to her body, enduring the pain, slowly opened her eyes, staggered to her feet, and tremblingly used the final alchemy technique:

"Pill formed."

In an instant, all the phantoms disappeared, and the two pills spun around in Xia Ge's palm like shooting stars.

And the destination of the two dazzling pills also drew the people's attention to the masked girl on the mountain peak.

"Who is that?!"

"I don't know."

"She's wearing a mask..."

"Anyway, she must be a new-level alchemist!!"

"Oh my god, I wonder which sect's genius she is. She looks very young... and even younger than Xia Wuyin..."

"Don't mention that name!"

"Yeah, it's bad luck, bad luck."

"..."

People were talking in a flurry.
But no one noticed that in a corner, Chang Nian, who was not participating with the disciples of Lingxi Peak, was carrying a long sword and a silver bell in his hand that kept shaking.

He trembled as he raised his head and looked at the black-robed girl who had refined a ground-level pill on the mountain top covered by the golden sky.

That was...

Su Chan quietly stood on the mountaintop, the wind blowing her red skirt, the lingering golden light in the sky reflecting the shallow curve of her lips, like a girl in love, looking sincerely and deeply at the person she was willing to pay any price for.

She saved her once.

Su Chan thought, unable to help but smile.

It's really good.

Just thinking about it made her heart feel sweet and happy.

Xia Ge did not notice Su Chan's gaze. Her black night-walking clothes were torn and tattered by the evil spirits, but the medicine from the system store was really effective. Although it was painful, her body looked intact.

Intact to the point that no one could imagine that this body was once torn apart by evil spirits like a rag doll and then slowly grew back.

A ground-level pill master who was fed to the ghosts.

Even if she walked back from the Gate of Ghosts and stepped on the peak of wind and moon, she would not feel any sense of glory without the person who opened his eyes and said "Congratulations" to her.

Xia Ge held two life-saving pills and walked down unsteadily, step by step, like a ritual, into the first circle, then knelt in front of Gu Peiju, took off her mask, chewed the pill, kissed her lips, and slowly passed the medicine to her.

The soul guardian did a good job, and Sister Shi did not encounter any accidents.

Xia Ge held Gu Peiju's hand tightly, their fingers interlocked.

Their lips and tongues intertwined, gentle and affectionate.

Su Chan, who was eager to break free from Xia Ge's fingertips, looked at the girl kissing someone else below, and the smile on her lips slowly turned cold, and the sweetness in her heart slowly turned bitter.

But she was not in a hurry.

"It has to wait until the end."
After a while, she chuckled lightly, seemingly nonchalant, yet also confrontational.

The Wan Hun Pill could at most restore half of Gu Peijiu's soul that had been destroyed by the soul poison, but...

So what?

Su Chan's soul poison from the Life-Ending Dagger, who could she save and who could stay?

Moreover, it was just a half soul.

Xia Ge fed her the medicine, her long eyelashes drooping down, the brilliant golden light and fragrance of the pill drifting through the entire forest, however, the person she wanted to save still couldn't open their eyes.

But their breathing was even.

As if to put her at ease.

...No.

Still...no.

Why was it still not working?

Xia Ge felt a bit lost.

If this didn't work, what else could she do?

"Is there nothing I can do?" Xia Ge asked, "Is the Wan Hun Pill useless?"

The system didn't know how to comfort her.

Xia Ge touched Gu Peijiu's face, finally embracing her neck, tears falling down silently.

She couldn't let her senior sister see her cry.

...Otherwise, her senior sister...would also be sad.

The system felt a bit uneasy and said, "It's not useless..."

"If it's useful, why isn't she waking up?"

"The medicine...needs time to take effect."
In the distance, footsteps could be heard approaching. It was likely people who wanted to see the newly promoted, and perhaps the only, Earth-level alchemist in the Fengyue Continent.

Xia Ge wiped away her tears, put on her mask, and changed into her Zhenhun outfit.

The system said, "You..."

"Sister, my name is Xia Ge." Xia Ge kissed Gu Peijiu's forehead and whispered, "From now on, Xia Wuyin is not me."

She was the new Earth-level alchemist who obtained the Zhenhun pill, Xia Ge.

The identity of "Xia Wuyin" could not be washed away no matter how much she tried. If people found out that Xia Wuyin, who released evil spirits, was her, it would be impossible to clear her name. After all, Su Chan's impersonation caught her off guard when she summoned the evil spirits, and she had disappeared during the refining of the Wanhun pill, so she couldn't confront Su Chan face to face.

Xia Ge didn't have the energy to engage in meaningless entanglements with people as her sister was in this state. Moreover, Xia Wuyin's infamous reputation was something she didn't want her sister to be associated with.

And...

For her, the identity of Xia Wuyin was meaningless.

She no longer wanted to be the "Xia Wuyin" standing behind her sister.

She wanted to be Xia Ge.

The Xia Ge who could stand in front of her sister and protect her.

...The true Xia Ge.

She wouldn't forget her real name.

People arrived, whispering to each other. Xia Ge stood up with Gu Peijiu in her arms. The aura of the Zhenhun pill suddenly shook open, and the crowd was suddenly startled and dared not approach her.

However, there was always someone in a group who was fearless.

"Hey! Who are you! That's our senior disciple of the Lingxi Peak!" Lu Qie saw her senior sister being held by someone, not knowing whether she was alive or dead, and was suddenly furious. "Put her down!"

Senior Brother Lu.

Xia Ge remained silent for a moment, and used her original voice to say softly, "I am her friend."

"She's poisoned, and I'm here to help."

The girl's voice was clear and gentle, like a spring flowing down from the mountains. "You can trust me."
Lu Qie's body was half-numbed by the crisp voice of the young girl, but she quickly came to her senses and said, "... Why should we believe you?"

In an instant!

The ancient town soul's breath became even deeper and people took a step back and looked uneasy when they recognized the clothing she wore.

Everyone was fighting for it, even the priceless treasures that had caused many casualties were now on this earth-level alchemist who nobody even knew what she looked like.

Xia Ge felt depressed but her voice was still soft, "I will send the person to Lingxi Peak, you can rest assured."

"We are not assured."

The boy's voice was faint and sounded a little hoarse.

Xia Ge looked up and saw Ye Ze standing beside Lu Qie, staring at her with his eyes, "If you want to go back to Lingxi Peak with us, we can't hand over a major disciple of the peak to a stranger."

The boy's eyes were a little red, and his body was covered in scars. He looked like he had cried, but also like nothing had happened.

Xia Ge thought of Ye Ze's question about the impostor before.

She couldn't describe how she felt, a little tired and a little bored.

Right now, she just wanted to protect the person in her arms, and everything else didn't matter to her.

Therefore, it was not worth being sad about.

"I am not a stranger to her," Xia Ge muttered to herself, "but you are."
