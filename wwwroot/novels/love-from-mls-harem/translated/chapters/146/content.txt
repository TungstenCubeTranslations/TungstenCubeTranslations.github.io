When Xia Ge came to her senses, she looked at the peach trees upstream of the creek. It was still early spring and the mountain was particularly cold, so the peach blossoms had not yet bloomed.

Not seeing the peach blossoms, Xia Ge wasn't too disappointed. She thought it was too early to see them anyway. After thinking for a moment, she decided to take a detour down the mountain and buy some candy to bring to her senior sister.

She was used to taking the small path down the mountain and had gone around twice when she suddenly heard a low groan and a threatening voice:

"Do you give up?!"

"You little brat..."

Xia Ge stopped and looked at the several blue-clothed figures not far away, as well as the Danfeng youth in red and white in the middle.

The formula of Jianfeng was so familiar, the unchanging need for a beating.

Xia Ge sneered, ready to go up and teach them a lesson. She wasn't like before when she had to come up with a hundred reasons and excuses to teach someone a lesson. If Jianfeng dared to bite people, she would make sure they broke their teeth!

Just as Xia Ge was about to go up and teach them a lesson, she suddenly heard a soft and sweet voice.

It carried a bit of laziness and a smile.

"Hey, what are you guys doing?"

The blue-clothed figures who were teaching someone a lesson immediately stopped, and the leading youth was somewhat frightened, "...Miss?"

The person who came was slender, with black hair tied up lightly with a blue hairband. The almond-shaped eyes under her forehead were clear and sweet, and it was Chu Yi.

"How can you bully people so casually?"

Chu Yi took two steps forward, her smile gentle, but the dark color hidden in her pitch-black eyes was concealed. "It's not good if someone sees this."

As she spoke, she went over to the Danfeng youth lying on the ground, squatting down and reaching out her hand. "Can you stand up?"

The youth gritted his teeth, staring at the Jianfeng clothes on Chu Yi's body, and clenched his fists tightly. "Get out of here!"

Birds of a feather!

Chu Yi said, "Do you think we're with him?"

The youth exclaimed, "Jianfeng isn't a good person!!"

"I see." Chu Yi tilted her head and looked sideways at the blue-clothed youth who was leading them. "Then... come over here."
The leading young man hesitated for a moment before walking over nervously. "Miss..."

"Reach out your hand and pull me up," Chu Yi said with a sweet smile as she squatted on the ground.

The young man looked at the angry young man staring at him from the ground and then at Chu Yi, who was smiling sweetly. He hesitated and reached out his hand towards her.

When Xia Ge saw Chu Yi, she stopped in her tracks and even subconsciously wanted to take a step back. However, it was too late as Chu Yi had already noticed her and even flashed a shallow smile at her before pulling the young man's hand.

Xia Ge's initial arrogance and momentum disappeared in an instant when she saw Chu Yi. It wasn't that she was afraid, but rather she would rather not see the current "important figures" of Jianfeng. This was because every time she saw them, she couldn't help but think of Ye Ze and immediately felt upset.

She smiled stiffly at Chu Yi, but before the smile could even last three seconds, she heard a light sound of "click" followed by the blue-clothed young man's miserable scream!

His wrist was twisted into a twisted arc!

Chu Yi calmly retracted her hand. The bullied young man stared blankly at the blue-clothed young man's twisted wrist and the delicate hand that seemed to have no strength for a long time before he came back to his senses.

The several Jianfeng young men who were bullying people next to them took several steps back in horror, but when they met Chu Yi's smiling eyes, they stopped in their tracks.

"Unruly children should be disciplined," Chu Yi stood up, put her hands behind her back, and turned to look at Xia Ge, smiling slightly. "Brother, am I right?"

Xia Ge: "..."

The young man whose wrist was twisted trembled all over but didn't dare to resist, and knelt down towards the bullied young man with a "bang."

The sound of his knee hitting the ground made people's knees ache.

Xia Ge rubbed her knees in her heart and twitched her mouth. "Ah, yes."

Encountering this kind of internal strife for the first time...

She paused and kindly added, "I... You don't have to call me brother."

We're not familiar yet.

"Why?" Chu Yi tilted her head.

"It's not quite appropriate," Xia Ge said tactfully.

"Oh, I'm really sorry," Chu Yi chuckled lightly. The black eyes stared at Xia Ge, and the smile on the surface of the pupils covered the deep undercurrents. "I have a strange habit. Whenever I see someone I like, I can't help but call them brother." 

Xia Ge: "..."
Xia Ge touched her own face.

If someone else had said this, she could have shamelessly said thank you for liking her, but when Chu Yi said it, it just didn't feel right.

" 'This is really troublesome. ' " Chu Yi approached, and the girl's eyebrows and eyes were already fully open, with a delicate taste in every movement. As she approached, Xia Ge noticed that the girl's eyes were lightly lined with peach blossom makeup, which, paired with her bright eyes, was particularly charming. She leaned in close to Xia Ge, her delicate hand pulling at her collar, not too heavy or too light, her eyes fixed on Xia Ge, her breath shallow. "Brother, you must be thinking this way now, right?"

Xia Ge: "...No." She didn't think like that at all!! She didn't!!

"How could that be?"

Chu Yi chuckled lightly, her peach blossom makeup eyes hiding a deep chill. "How could there be no solution?"

Xia Ge hadn't said anything yet when she heard the girl's low laughter, vaguely eerie.

"How about Brother digs out my eyes?" Chu Yi smiled at her, seemingly innocent. "Then I won't see you, and I won't call you brother. That way, it's good for everyone."

Xia Ge: "You're really joking...call me whatever you want."

Call her whatever you liked, it wasn't like a couple of words would make a difference. But losing an eye just because she called him brother was too terrifying!

Chu Yi stared at her, as if trying to etch her appearance into her soul.

Crazy obsession, covered up by light exaggeration.

It had been three years.

Three years had passed.

She... was about to lose control.

"I think," Xia Ge grabbed the snow-white wrist that was pulling at her collar, and lowered her head to look at Chu Yi, whose face was like peach blossoms. She whispered, "Let's not talk about digging out eyes so casually...if you don't love yourself."

"Oh?" Chu Yi greedily enjoyed the delicate and soft warmth on her wrist, but her face remained unchanged, just raising an eyebrow at Xia Ge.

Xia Ge whispered, "If you don't love yourself."
Many, many years ago, it wasn't just her conscience that led her to save the butterfly.

There was also the sword she had plunged into that man.

This child was in a cold and desperate despair, using someone else's blood to convey to Xiage - 

I want to live.

It was shocking.

Because she knew that this child wanted to live for herself, she took her away.

Because the little butterfly wanted to see her, wanted to see this world.

So she braved all obstacles, obtained Tianmu grass for her, and let her see the light of day again.

But now, this child tells her so lightly that she can gouge out her own eyes.

She doesn't feel sad.

Just disappointed.

- If you don't love yourself.

Xiage took her hand off her own shirt, "Then no one will love you."

- No one will love her?

- Someone still loves her?

Ha.

Chuyi sneered inwardly.

This was really the best joke she had ever heard.

She had never heard a joke better than this.

Such a pleasant phrase.

Only this person who had once abandoned her could say it so beautifully, right?
Chu Yi remained indifferent in her thoughts.

But there was no way.

She wanted to get her.

She looked at her hands that were released, then shifted her gaze to Xia Ge. Her eyes were surprisingly bright, and her smile was still perfect. "Thank you, Xia Xiao Zhan Ling. I have learned a lot."

For some reason, even though she didn't call her brother anymore, Xia Ge felt uncomfortable. Under Chu Yi's gaze, she felt like she was being stripped naked, which was embarrassing.

"Just now, thank you." Xia Ge turned to help the boy who was still stunned on the ground, but before she could reach out, she heard Chu Yi say, "This little matter, why should brother do it himself?"

As soon as she finished speaking, the several arrogant boys next to her immediately stepped forward to help the boy up. They were obedient, and their movements were faster than hers. Xia Ge's hand reached out, but it was empty. The boy who was helped up was still a bit unwilling, but when he met Chu Yi's smiling eyes, he suddenly shuddered. He looked at the boy who was still kneeling in front of him and his twisted wrist. Suddenly, a chill rose from his back. The few points of unwillingness disappeared instantly.

Xia Ge: "..." Brother?

Okay, she called her back again.

"Take him back." Chu Yi commanded kindly.

Xia Ge stepped forward to stop the people. "This is our Dan Feng's business. You don't need to trouble yourself."

Chu Yi turned her head and suddenly said, "It's been three years."

Xia Ge turned around to look at her.

"Xia Xiao Zhan Ling hasn't been to the Sword Peak for three years."

"A Ze brother drank a lot of alcohol that day." Chu Yi stared at Xia Ge, her smile carrying a strange taste. "He said..."

Xia Ge's face remained unchanged, but her body stiffened slightly. She glanced at the few people, and they immediately took the boy away. Chu Yi was about to say something else when she suddenly heard a faint voice.

"What did he say?"

Xia Ge's eyes suddenly lit up. "Senior Sister?"

= =

The night was dark.

The Thousand Souls Sect.
"The fourth picture is here."

On the round glass table, three old maps were pieced together, and a stunning girl in red threw the fourth map onto it. Suddenly, a light blue line appeared on the table, and spiritual energy flowed into the line, causing the four maps to emit a dazzling light.

A woman in black stood quietly on the side, her body elegant, and a silver-white mask covered her left face. Her eyes gazed at the round table, also emitting a faint blue light.

"I always thought that finding these four maps would lead us to the path to Evil Spirit Mountain." Su Chan lounged lazily on a throne covered in white fur, revealing her slender, fair legs. Her narrow eyes were vaguely charming and enchanting. "Now you're telling me...there's no path on these maps?"

A low pressure filled the air, and the woman in red was heavy. Su Chan's lips curled into a faint smile, and a sinister aura surged within her.

The woman in black trembled slightly, then whispered, "Although there is no path, it is...more convenient than a path."

"But...please..." The woman in black gritted her teeth. "I want to know, my lord..."

"Oh?" Su Chan raised an eyebrow slightly. After a moment, she suddenly laughed, and her slender, fair fingers tapped the armrest, smiling ambiguously. "High Priest, are you bargaining with me?"

The woman in black was Qin Yue.

Qin Yue's forehead was slightly sweaty. "I am very grateful for my lord's saving grace, but..."

She closed her eyes and opened them again, now resolute. "I believe my lord also knows that I am alive for that child."

"I have already given you the demon bell. I just want to know how she is doing now."

"...I have no intention of offending you!"

"Sure." Su Chan changed her posture, and her soft black hair wrapped around her fingertips. She glanced at Qin Yue and chuckled lightly. "But...High Priest, you should change your title."

Qin Yue was slightly startled.

Su Chan saw her confusion and released the hair wrapped around her fingers, then leaned closer to her with shallow breaths.

"In front of me..."

"You should address yourself as...your subordinate."

Qin Yue clenched her fists, and her face turned pale.

When you give someone a whip, you have to give them a piece of candy.
Su Chan lazily returned to her seat, her long eyelashes curled up, revealing her lazy yet sharp eyes. "That child, she's doing exceptionally well."

Dan Feng's command was immediately followed by his subordinates.

The lost little priestess of the demon sect had unexpectedly become the leader of the righteous sect. It was truly an unexpected turn of events.

However...

Qin Yue looked at her, her lips slightly pursed.

"What? Don't believe me?" Su Chan propped up her chin. "But whether you believe it or not doesn't matter."

Qin Yue replied, "I... as your subordinate, naturally believe you."

The last few words were spoken through gritted teeth.

Su Chan chuckled lightly, but her eyes were icy cold.

"Then, Grand Priestess, can you tell me why we have the map but no route to follow?"

Qin Yue closed her eyes, then opened them and said, "The Evil Spirit Mountain floats above the sea of clouds, elusive and without a fixed path to follow--"

"Oh?"

"No route?" 

Then, what was the purpose of these four maps?

"These four... are not maps of the route," Qin Yue paused, enunciating each word, "they are summoning maps for the Evil Spirit Mountain."
