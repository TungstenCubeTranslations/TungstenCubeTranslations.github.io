I don't quite understand what's wrong with me. I feel anxious, like I've missed something important, and I also feel angry and nervous.

The system is confused: "…Why did you throw it away? Hurry up and pick up the red talisman. Maybe it can be useful if you fix it up a bit. Plus, you can also sell the puppet for some points."

Xia Ge: "…"

Xia Ge tries to retrieve the talisman, but it won't come off. She's afraid of tearing it if she forces it, so she ends up breaking the puppet's fingers one by one to get the talisman out.

The system complains: "You're too rough. You won't get a good price for it this way…"

Xia Ge: "Shut up."

The five broken wooden fingers are left on the ground, but Xia Ge doesn't care. She has some knowledge of talismans, so she awkwardly combines two talismans into one and puts it back on the round table.

However, there's no reaction whatsoever.
