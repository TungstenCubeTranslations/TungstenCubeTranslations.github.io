Chapter 193: Falling Flowers Have Intentions

In the courtyard, the plum blossoms were in full bloom, and the fragrance was refreshing.

Ye Xuanqing stood under a tree and looked at the falling petals. His eyes were deep, and his expression was calm. It was as if he was lost in thought.

At this moment, a figure slowly approached him, and a familiar voice sounded behind him, "Brother Ye, you're here."

Ye Xuanqing turned around and saw that it was Su Xiaobao. He smiled and said, "Xiaobao, what brings you here?"

Su Xiaobao walked over and said, "I came to see you. I heard that you haven't been feeling well lately, so I brought you some medicine."

Ye Xuanqing took the medicine and said, "Thank you, Xiaobao. You're always so thoughtful."

Su Xiaobao smiled and said, "It's nothing. I just want to take care of you."

Ye Xuanqing looked at Su Xiaobao and suddenly felt a strange feeling in his heart. He couldn't help but ask, "Xiaobao, do you like me?"

Su Xiaobao was stunned for a moment, and then he blushed and said, "Brother Ye, what are you talking about? I...I..."

Ye Xuanqing smiled and said, "It's okay. I understand. Falling flowers have intentions, and the flowing water has feelings. I'm sorry, Xiaobao. I can't return your feelings."

Su Xiaobao was silent for a moment, and then he smiled and said, "It's okay, Brother Ye. I just want to be by your side and take care of you."

Ye Xuanqing nodded and said, "Thank you, Xiaobao. You're a good friend."

Su Xiaobao smiled and said, "Brother Ye, let's go for a walk. The weather is nice today."

Ye Xuanqing nodded, and the two of them walked out of the courtyard together, enjoying the beauty of the plum blossoms.
