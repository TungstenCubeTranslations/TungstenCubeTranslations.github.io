Cold tears fell.

He suddenly became a little distracted.

...Even puppets can shed tears?

He suddenly heard a whisper from the young man next to him, "Let's go..."

Ye Ze lowered his head.

But he saw the always cheerful young man, with wet eyes reflecting the flickering flames.

"Ye Ze." The young man's voice was soft. "I'm a little scared."

Ye Ze was stunned.

"I don't want to..."

I don't want to become a puppet master.

If that's the case, really.

It's so lonely.

Ye Ze was silent for a moment.

Finally, he sneered and said softly.

"Let's go back...you're really effeminate."

It's just a burning at the stake, why cry.
