Chapter 119: The Tragedy of Puppets [Extra Update] (2)

As the night deepened, the streets became quieter. The only sounds that could be heard were the occasional footsteps of pedestrians and the distant howls of stray dogs.

In a small alleyway, a figure dressed in black slowly made his way towards a dilapidated building. The building was old and shabby, with broken windows and a rusty door. It looked like it had been abandoned for years.

The figure stopped in front of the door and knocked three times. After a few seconds, the door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit room inside.

"Come in," a voice said from inside the room.

The figure stepped inside and closed the door behind him. The room was small and cramped, with only a table and a few chairs. A man was sitting at the table, smoking a cigarette.

"Did you bring it?" the man asked, his voice hoarse.

The figure nodded and took out a small package from his pocket. He placed it on the table and pushed it towards the man.

The man opened the package and examined its contents. A smile slowly spread across his face.

"Good job," he said, taking out a wad of cash from his pocket and placing it on the table. "You'll get your cut tomorrow."

The figure nodded and turned to leave.

"Wait," the man said, his voice suddenly serious. "There's something else I need you to do."

The figure turned back to face him.

"I need you to send a message to our friends in the north," the man said. "Tell them that we're ready to make a move."

The figure nodded and left the room, disappearing into the darkness of the night.
