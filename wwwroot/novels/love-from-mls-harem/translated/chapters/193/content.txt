Mao Qing awkwardly greeted her, "You... Xia Wuyin...?"

Because of her crossdressing appearance, Mao Qing dared to recognize her, but also seemed hesitant.

Xia Ge wanted to say that she was not called that name anymore, but seeing Mao Qing's nervous and confused expression - although she didn't know what she was nervous about - Xia Ge didn't mention her own pile of problems again.

So she just smiled and said, "Yeah, it's me."

Mao Qing's expression became even stiffer, "Are you really... a girl?"

Xia Ge responded with a "Hmm" and asked, "Before... why did you run away when you saw me?"

And who was the person who threw the iron piece at her?

Mao Qing suddenly came to her senses from the unexpected news that Xia Wuyin was a woman. Her lips trembled, as if she wanted to say something, but in the end, she couldn't say anything. She could only cover her eyes and let tears flow slowly through her fingers.

"I... didn't mean to... I didn't betray Lingxi Peak... I..."

Xia Ge suddenly realized.

It was still nice to see an old friend. Xia Ge felt a little better about her suppressed mood and wanted to tease her with a joke like "Hey buddy, I didn't betray Lingxi Peak either. I'm only here because I was temporarily transferred from the central government to investigate something, and happened to share hardships with you, comrade..." But seeing the other party's nervous and tearful appearance, she felt like it might be a bit too much to say that and refrained. She just smiled and said, "Hmm, I know."

If Su Chan had impersonated Mao Qing and summoned evil ghosts to slaughter the cultivators with her unblinking eyes, Mao Qing would not be okay now, and it really was a blessing in disguise.

Mao Qing was taken aback, "...What do you know?"

Xia Ge said, "I know you have your reasons."

"..."

Seeing that Xia Ge didn't seem to have any intention of pursuing the matter, Mao Qing, who didn't know Xia Ge's current identity, relaxed a little. She laughed at herself, "Everyone has their own reasons, even a gambler who has lost everything... But no one cares."

Xia Ge was speechless.

"I have nowhere else to go." Mao Qing said, "I have nothing left."

She hugged the jar tightly, "I can only stay here..."

Of course, Su Chan, who had impersonated Mao Qing, would not let the real Mao Qing have another chance to appear.
Xia Ge said, "Great, me too."

Mao Qing was taken aback.

Xia Ge was just about to confide in her old friend when suddenly a cold wind blew past her ear. She moved slightly to the side and a dark figure appeared between her and Mao Qing.

Xia Ge looked up and saw a young man in white clothes with a string of paper talismans hanging from his waist. His once fierce aura had now disappeared and he held a paper blade infused with spiritual energy in his pale hand. He stood in front of Mao Qing, staring at Xia Ge with his pitch-black eyes that reflected no light.

"Mister Bai?" Mao Qing was surprised and reached out to tug at his clothes, feeling somewhat uneasy. "Don't..."

Xia Ge didn't mind and smiled slightly. "It's been a while since we last met."

Huo Bai, or White Blade.

White Blade ignored her friendly greeting and simply stared at her, saying succinctly, "She has nothing to do with Lingxi Peak anymore."

The implied meaning of his words was clear: don't disturb her.

The "she" he referred to... was Mao Qing?

Xia Ge smiled and said, "Great, I have nothing to do with Lingxi Peak anymore either."

White Blade said, "I know."

Mao Qing was a little confused. "What do you mean by 'nothing to do with Lingxi Peak'? But..."

White Blade didn't say anything. Mao Qing, who was not from the demonic sect, naturally didn't know about the recent events.

Xia Ge looked around and saw that the two demonic guards had not followed them. It seemed that she had managed to shake them off.

Feeling comfortable, Xia Ge said to Mao Qing, "You see, this isn't a place to talk. Shall we find a place to drink and chat?"

White Blade looked at her unkindly.

Xia Ge responded with a kind and reserved smile.

Mao Qing also felt that this wilderness was not a place to chat and led Xia Ge in a certain direction.

Mao Qing walked in front, Xia Ge by her side, and White Blade followed behind.

Xia Ge pointed to him and said, "He..."
Mao Qing said, "He is Huo Bai."

Xia Ge looked very surprised and responded, "Ah, him?"

Mao Qing was speechless and said, "Don't tell me you don't know. Bai Ren told me that you know everything, but you're pretending to be ignorant."

Xia Ge asked, "What else did he say?"

Mao Qing looked at Xia Ge and said, "He said that you were a girl... I didn't believe him."

Xia Ge remained silent.

It was understandable that Bai Ren was not fond of her, as she had first bewitched him with her charm and then caused him to fail his mission with her puppet doll.

Xia Ge changed the subject and asked, "How did they catch you?"

Mao Qing paused for a moment and said, "It was an accident."

She didn't mention that she was caught by the demonic cultists while seeing Huo Bai off, as she didn't blame Xia Ge for not telling her that Huo Bai was a spy.

Everyone had their own things to do and their own reasons for doing them. Moreover, it was pointless to blame Xia Ge at this point.

Finally, Mao Qing brought Xia Ge to a somewhat remote small courtyard. She unlocked the door very quietly.

"Shh," she whispered, "someone is resting inside, so be quiet."

It was natural for someone to rest at such a late hour.

Xia Ge obediently lowered her voice.

After entering the courtyard, Mao Qing lit a lantern, illuminating the courtyard. Xia Ge saw a persimmon tree planted in the southwest corner of the courtyard, as well as grape vines. Two small lanterns were hanging under the vines, shining brightly. There was a small stone table for playing chess under the grape arbor. To the east was a small kitchen, and in front of the main hall hung a layer of bead curtains, making it difficult to see inside. There were resting places on both sides of the main hall. Though small, the courtyard had everything one needed.

Mao Qing put the clay pot she was carrying in the kitchen and invited Xia Ge to sit at the small stone table, saying softly, "I wanted to take you somewhere else, but the demonic cult has strict rules, and I have no place to go with my identity. I can only bring you here."

Xia Ge asked, "Someone is resting inside?"

Mao Qing hesitated a bit with her expression.

Xia Ge smiled and said, "It's okay, I'm just asking casually."
Bai Ren sneered and interrupted Ma Qing's hesitation.

"Is there a guest?" A soft, alluring voice sounded, accompanied by a hand lifting the delicate pearl curtain.

The room lit up, revealing a beautiful yet hazy figure of a woman. She wore a purple silk dress, slightly plump with a goose egg face and red lips. Her every move exuded the charm of a mature woman. However, she wore a half mask on her left face, tied with a purple silk thread, and her black hair was styled with a simple knot, adorned with delicate pearls and thin silk, adding to her mysterious beauty.

Ma Qing said, "An old friend has come."

"Old friend?" The woman smiled and walked out from behind the curtain, saying in a gentle voice, "Since there are guests, I should not..."

For some reason, Xia Ge felt a sense of familiarity with this woman, but she couldn't quite place it.

As they locked eyes, the woman's expression changed, her face turned pale, her breathing quickened, and she instinctively covered her chest. Xia Ge's eyes widened, and her black pupils turned emerald green.

[Half-puppet: A half-human, half-puppet created by the demonic cult's experiments, neither human nor ghost, and still alive in the world.]

Ma Qing noticed the woman's discomfort and said, "Madam Ye, are you feeling unwell? Quickly..."

...Madam Ye?!

Xia Ge immediately realized why she found the woman familiar-
The contours of this person's eyebrows and eyes are surprisingly similar to Ye Ze's!

Xia Ge immediately stood up, feeling embarrassed and ashamed.

Bai Ren snorted coldly and said, "You shouldn't have come."

Xia Ge was speechless. She just wanted to chat with Mao Qing, but who knew there was such a landmine hidden in the courtyard?! And Mao Qing didn't even know what was happening outside, but Bai Ren clearly knew and didn't say anything?

Sure enough, Bai Ren was always looking down on her, no matter how she looked at it.

Mao Qing said anxiously, "You sit down first, we'll talk later."

After speaking, she hurriedly went to take care of Madam Ye, who had a sudden heart attack.

Xia Ge sat down again and faced Bai Ren in silence.

The night grew darker and the two of them remained silent for a while.

"But..." Bai Ren lifted his eyelids to look at her and sneered, "Her memories are a bit confused, sometimes clear, sometimes not. Little Priestess doesn't need to worry too much about karma."

In fact, she had known about this matter for a long time, but she didn't expect to actually encounter it.

At that time, when she went to drink, she was attacked by Bai Ren and Bai Luo's puppets for the first time outside the village. Her senior sister repelled the puppets, and the reason why she used the Soul-Capturing and Soul-Stealing technique on Bai Ren and released the puppet dolls was for this.

She had read in a book before... The former leader of the Demon Cult was conducting puppet experiments and needed the corpses of the world's top experts. Ye Ze's deceased parents were among them.

As for Su Chan's puppet experiment...

Xia Ge thought that the puppet experiment was not reliable at all. It was a dead end to send them over, let alone Ye Ze's parents were already dead. But at that time, she didn't really believe in resurrection from the dead. She just hoped that Bai Ren could steal their bodies for her.

Xia Ge just thought that if Ye Ze could bury her parents, it might resolve some of his obsessions.

It was okay to use hatred as motivation, but don't always live in hatred.
As for herself, Xia Ge lived her life aimlessly without much thought.

After all, at that time, Xia Ge did not know the twists and turns behind her own body, nor could she express it in words.

But as luck would have it, Bai Ren was sent by Su Chan to act as a spy in Lingxi Peak, and Xia Ge's plan to steal the corpse, which was not very well thought out but still had some brains behind it, fell through. After that, Xia Ge did not come up with any good plans to contact the demonic cult and had to give up.

She never expected that the person who was already dead would suddenly reappear in the flesh.

Xia Ge said, "I'm not worried."

"Not worried?" Bai Ren sneered, "Our little priestess really has a heart of stone when it comes to matters that don't concern her. But let me remind you, don't be too relieved. After all, the enemy who slaughtered an entire family, even if they die, forget, and their soul doesn't remember, they will still hate the flesh when they meet."

Xia Ge said, "...You really don't need to target me. I won't compete with you for your wife."

Bai Ren continued to sneer, "Can you even take her away?"

After laughing, he suddenly felt that something was not right and immediately shut his mouth.

Xia Ge looked at him with pity, "You really have confidence. It seems that Mao Qing really likes you."

Bai Ren's pale face finally turned slightly red, "Shut up."
