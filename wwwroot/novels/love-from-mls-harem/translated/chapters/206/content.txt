Xia Ge suddenly became more uneasy.

It's no wonder Su Chan didn't want to hear anything related to Chu Yao.

The tassel of the sword that Chu Yao gave her was still in her ring.

"I heard... that the eldest daughter of the Chu family wanted to come and take you out, but she was unsuccessful," Lady Ye said as she gently combed her black hair. "I suppose she has a deep relationship with you."

Xia Ge explained, "We were fellow disciples at the Lingxi Peak."

She was also a bit puzzled. Why did Lady Ye suddenly bring this up?

Lady Ye shook her head, sighed slightly, and didn't play any more tricks. "I also heard that the Chu girl has already been engaged to someone and will be getting married after she goes back."

Xia Ge froze in place for a moment. She looked at Lady Ye incredulously and asked, "What did you say?!"

How could it be possible?!

Xia Ge's mind was in chaos for a moment, and she didn't even know how to think. She just instinctively denied it, "It's impossible!!"

Chu Yao, such a proud person, she still had her ideals, she still wanted to be the head of the family, how could she...

Lady Ye said, "I also heard about it from Bai Ren, who is involved in this mission."

Xia Ge just kept saying, "It's impossible... it's impossible!"

She didn't know if she couldn't believe it or didn't want to believe it.

Lady Ye was considerate of her feelings and got up to make her a cup of warm tea, which she put in her hand.

"Don't get excited for now."

Xia Ge was a bit incoherent. Scenes from Danfeng flashed through her mind. Chu Yao... she was so proud!

"Nothing is impossible," Lady Ye's voice was gentle and soothing, but her words were a bit helpless. "Right?"

This was what Xia Ge had said to Bai Ren before.

The tea in Xia Ge's hand rippled in waves. After a long time, she calmed down and asked in a strained voice, "Why?"

She had her own feelings and couldn't accept Chu Yao's feelings for her, but that didn't mean she didn't trust her or wasn't moved by her sacrifice.
Translation:

She suddenly remembered what Chu Yao had said to her before leaving.

-"But if one day you see yourself clearly."

-"...you have to learn to walk out bravely on your own."

At the time, she was a bit confused, but now Xia Ge suddenly understood.

Chu Yao said she would take her away, and if she agreed, Chu Yao would take her away completely, but she refused...

So with Chu Yao's personality, she would never give up on her family.

That's why she said to let her walk out bravely on her own... because Chu Yao, who had already been married off, according to the Chu family's ridiculous family rules of abandoning swords and giving up weapons, would no longer be able to wield a sword!

Chu Yao did what she did completely out of desperation!

She took a sip of tea in her hand, placed it on the table, and stared at Madam Ye: "...who is the other party?"

"I heard it's the Chang family." Madam Ye read the name "Chang family", seeming to find it familiar, and her delicate eyebrows furrowed slightly, but soon relaxed again. "It is said that the Chu family owes the Chang family a huge amount of spirit stones because of poor management... and they are using this as a threat to force the Chu family to marry a daughter to their family."

Xia Ge said, "Are they crazy?"

Isn't the most valuable thing in the Chu family the ancient demonic Chu sword? Forcing someone's daughter to marry is not a skill at all.

Madam Ye shook her head. "It seems that the Chu family and the Chang family had a marriage agreement when they were children... Later, the illegitimate daughter became the legitimate daughter, and the Chu family relied on their power to break the agreement. Now that the Chu family is weak, the Chang family has risen... they naturally want to reclaim what is theirs."

Xia Ge's mood was stirred up, and she clenched her fists. "Thank you for telling me, Madam."

Madam Ye sighed and said, "I didn't plan on saying so much. But you are a good child."

"I shouldn't be kept in the dark about everything."

After thanking Madam Ye, Xia Ge hurriedly said goodbye and left with Mao Qing. "Hey, hey, how is Madam's mood... I've already cooked some food. Won't you stay and eat before you leave?"

"No, I suddenly remembered something urgent." Xia Ge said goodbye to Mao Qing and hurried back to her own priestly hall.

The system said, "What are you going to do?"

Xia Ge took out the sword tassel. "I can't do nothing."

"Are you going to leave the demonic cult?" The system asked.
"... I can't just sit here and do nothing." She sounded anxious this time.

The system was speechless. "Then you should have just agreed to go with Chu Yao earlier! What's the use of being a latecomer now?"

Xia Ge was even more angry at these words. "I didn't know she was engaged before! And she agreed to it!! And the other party is..."

But Xia Ge also knew that making excuses now was pointless.

She tightly gripped the golden tassel of her sword and felt for a moment that she was a useless bastard who couldn't do anything right.

She took a deep breath and tried to calm down, looking at the tassel in her hand. "First, first..."

The reason why she refused Chu Yao and stayed in the demonic sect was because she was most uncertain about herself.

She vaguely felt that something was wrong with her. She had been particularly impulsive and irritable lately, and it was hard for her to stay calm except when she was focused on doing something. But she had no idea what the problem was.

And the terrible nightmare about ice cream from before was the real reason she had been hesitant.

...It was really terrifying.

Su Chan's words, "You are yourself only if you stay here," were the fundamental reason she decided to stay.

It wasn't just blindly believing Su Chan's words, but rather, she really felt that something was wrong with herself.

She was afraid that her dreams would come true.

It was instinctive.

But now she couldn't afford to think too much.

Even if she was afraid, she couldn't just watch Chu Yao jump into the fire pit!!

"First... first, we need to know the wedding date."

The system said, "...Where can we find out about that?"

Xia Ge was now in a precarious situation, surrounded by all of Su Chan's people. If she made even the slightest move, it would almost immediately reach Su Chan's ears. Even when Lady Ye talked to her about Chu Yao's situation, she had to set up a layer of barriers.

Xia Ge didn't think Su Chan would tell her even if she asked directly.
In the end, she could only rely on herself... System's Mall!

This time, Xia Ge was too lazy to rely on the system and directly opened the mall to search for items.

The system said, "Hey, if you want something, you can ask me. I definitely know what I have..."

Xia Ge said, "I always feel like you're hiding something from me."

The system replied, "...I'm not. Don't make things up."

Xia Ge didn't bother with him and searched for useful items. However, she couldn't find anything suitable even after searching for a long time.

The system was helpless and said, "If you want something, just tell me...!"

Xia Ge expressed her distrust and said, "I'm afraid that if I tell you, you'll hide it from me."

The system was frustrated and said, "Why would I do that? I'm not trying to cheat you!"

Xia Ge looked at the pile of junk on her desk that she had spent a lot of points on, which was supposed to monitor her behavior but ended up being useless. "I didn't say you were cheating me, you're just not getting along with me."

The system was speechless.

After searching for a long time, Xia Ge found a "Marriage Book."

The system muttered, "You have good taste. This thing can show the fate and marriage date of mortals, but it's useless if you don't know their birthdates."

Xia Ge replied, "..."

She really didn't know.

She had been pen pals with Chu Yao for years, but didn't even know her birthdate. It was a bit irresponsible of her.

Xia Ge felt a bit ashamed, but she had no choice. Every time she wrote to Chu Yao, she would write in great detail, while Chu Yao was more reserved and would only write a few words in classical Chinese, even if it was just about trivial matters.

There are people like that, who can understand classical Chinese but can only write half in classical Chinese and half in modern Chinese... Xia Ge was one of those people.

Moreover, Chu Yao had never mentioned her birthdate.

Xia Ge gave up on that and searched for other things, but even after searching for a long time, she couldn't find what she was looking for.
The system pondered for a moment and cautiously said, "No, although I have a bad credit with you, I don't think it's a good idea for you to keep brooding over when others will get married... Don't worry, use your remaining rationality to think of a way out."

"Chu family is a big household, since Chu Yao's marriage is irreversible, there must have been a lot of rumors outside. You just need to find a way to get out from here," the system said, hesitating a bit when it mentioned "getting out". "So, I want to ask, what exactly do you want to do? Do you know the wedding date?"

Xia Ge slammed the table and gritted her teeth, "I want to snatch the bride!"

Chu Yao is such a good girl, who deserves her except for Xia Ge herself? She doesn't even deserve her, let alone the scum of the Chang family!

The system said, "No, won't people misunderstand you like this?"

If she rejected Chu Yao, and the latter became disheartened and decided to marry an honest man, how could Xia Ge, who kicked her away like a scum, turn around and snatch her bride?

"She can marry whoever she wants, but she can't give herself away to the Chang family so easily!" Xia Ge retorted.

The Chang family really has no good people!

The system suddenly said, "Why not marry you?"

Xia Ge: "..."

... Anyway, with the reminder from the system, Xia Ge, who was angry and dizzy, finally gained some rationality. It's rare to have such a special item as a tool to check someone's wedding date, but the system store is full of all kinds of teleportation tools.

Because of a special array, all teleportation arrays in the Qianhun Sect cannot be used. Xia Ge simply spent a lot of money in the system store to buy a Ground Diving Pearl - if you can't fly, can't use arrays, and can't teleport, then she could simply burrow underground and no one could catch her, right?

The Ground Diving Pearl is a good thing. As long as you throw the pearl on the ground, a large hole as if gnawed by a giant gopher will appear, and you can enjoy the pleasure of burrowing underground for about half an hour in the darkness... However, due to the product's imperfection, where you come out and how many meters you can cross is entirely a matter of luck.

Therefore, the Ground Diving Pearl is not very popular. Who would use this expensive and useless thing to act like a gopher under the protection of Mother Earth when there are teleportation arrays and scrolls with precise locations?

But, it has to be said that no matter what, everything has its use.

The fact that it could ignore the Qianhun Sect's ban on teleportation thanks to the protection of Mother Earth made it a treasure in Xia Ge's eyes, from a useless chicken rib to a valuable tool to escape.

Because she didn't know the specific date of Chu Yao's wedding, Xia Ge didn't dare to delay too much, but she also couldn't act too obviously - every time she escaped, she was always caught by Su Chan in a variety of ways, and anyone would have gotten used to it.

Bah.

What escape? She was going to save a lost girl!

Xia Ge angrily threw the Ground Diving Pearl onto the ground like a firecracker, and it disappeared into the ground without a trace.
There was no movement for a while.

Xia Ge: "... Xiao Gui, you don't sell fake goods, right?"

The system pretended to be surprised: "... Wait, let me check."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge didn't believe it. She went up to take a look, but in an instant, she stepped on nothing and the ground opened up into a deep hole, like the cellar next to the stolen well cover with a yellow warning sign that she encountered when she was a child.

Xia Ge didn't even have time to scream, and she fell straight down.

And in the second after she lost her voice.

System: "Ah, I just checked the information and you left before I could tell you... I mean, this is a semi-finished product, and you have to step on it to make it work."

Xia Ge, who had stepped on nothing: "..."

In the darkness, the system said deeply: "Trust me, I am invincible Gui, and I never sell fake goods."

Xia Ge's brain was congested as she fell upside down, expressionless: "You'd better sell fake goods next time."

Selling fake goods is better than being a pitfall who doesn't even say a word when someone falls upside down!
