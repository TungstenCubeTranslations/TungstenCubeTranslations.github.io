"She is my path of righteousness in this world."

Xia Ge was stunned. In that instant, tears almost fell from her eyes.

...Never before had there been a person who could make her heart beat so fast.

In that moment, Xia Ge felt that this person was her hero. She didn't need a colorful cloud or a golden armor. She just needed this person by her side.

Despite her slender figure, standing there was like an army fighting for her, able to withstand all the storms and criticisms, bringing peace of mind.

Without a word, she reached out and embraced her waist, her voice muffled, "Senior Sister."

Gu Peijiu's voice softened, "Hmm."

Pausing for a moment, she comforted her again, "I'm here."

Xia Ge sniffled, wanting to say something emotional, but after holding back for a while, she could only hear her voice choking, "Senior Sister, do you also think I'm like Lei Feng?"

She couldn't help but feel that the path of righteousness was not quite her style.

System: "..." How the hell are you supposed to get ivory from a dog's mouth?

Gu Peijiu's lips curled slightly, about to say something, when suddenly a black light burst into the white light and shot towards Xia Ge!

As expected, the Chang family was related to disaster!

Gu Peijiu's gaze suddenly turned cold, her fingers slightly curved, and a black spatial rift immediately tore open in mid-air. The Wenqing Sword emerged and crushed the black light to death on its way!

Because the Wenqing Sword contained the ashes of a god, Xia Ge had accidentally touched it before and had red hands as a result. Gu Peijiu had put it in the mustard space - but for disaster, this was undoubtedly a fatal weapon.

Under the endless dazzling white light, disaster failed to get any benefits. Chang Ren's pupils barely shrank.

"Zila..."

The sound of a slight pain was fleeting, and Xia Ge, who was immersed in her own emotions, didn't even notice this little incident.

The white light passed.

Those who had come to test the power of the ancient clothing were all lying on the ground, their eyes tightly closed, their bodies twitching in pain.

As for those who did not come forward due to their status, they looked at those lying on the ground with various expressions. However, when they looked at Gu Peijiu, their expressions were full of hesitation and contemplation.
Among them, Chang Ren and Yan Zhangmen had the most unpleasant expressions.

Chang Ren's expression was unpleasant because Huoming's surprise attack had failed. Wenqing Jian had killed the small black smoke in the air and entered the mustard seed space, but under the endless white light, no one had noticed this small anomaly.

"Gu Peijiu..." Huoming, who had missed his shot, returned to Chang Ren's side, his voice cold. "Just wait, I won't let go..."

Yan Zhangmen's expression was bad because of what Gu Peijiu had said earlier: "She is my righteous path in the mortal world."

It was simply outrageous!

An insult!!

After Huoming's defeat, Chang Ren swallowed his frustration and said, "Miss Gu is indeed powerful...I just don't know what realm she has reached?"

Xia Ge was also a little curious. Since her senior sister had returned, she couldn't sense her realm with her reconnaissance technique.

Gu Peijiu casually said, "Just a nameless pawn, what realm I have reached is not worth mentioning."

Everyone looked at the person lying on the ground, who was considered a prominent figure.

If you were a nameless pawn, what were these people? Garlic or scallions?

The red vines around the white-clad girl rolled lightly, and Gu Peijiu raised her eyes and said, "The people here are not something you can handle. Please leave."

It seemed that someone didn't want to give up and wanted to say something, but was suddenly pulled by the hem of their clothes.

"Why are you pulling me..."

"Look over there..."

Only then did everyone notice that the entire small courtyard had been covered by a barrier, and on the courtyard wall, countless black-clothed people were waiting in formation. Sharp arrows were placed on taut bows, and the arrowheads were hooked with fierce spiritual power. No one would doubt that if someone was shot in the head by one of these arrows, even if they had extraordinary abilities, it would not be a pleasant experience.

"Where did these people come from..."

"This...isn't this the territory of the black market?"

Yan Zhangmen looked at Gu Peijiu, her expression complicated. "...You already know?"

Gu Peijiu didn't say anything, just glanced at her lightly.
Gu Peijiu was a child picked up by Yan Sect's head, with excellent bone structure and an ancient charm in her hands. She only knew her name and said she couldn't remember anything else clearly, but she clearly expressed her desire to go to Lingxi Peak.

A rare talent fell from the sky, and it would be foolish not to accept it.

However, this matter was too sudden. While it was good to have a pie fall from the sky, it would be awkward if the pie was poisonous. After Yan Sect took her in, they investigated her identity, which was not difficult to find. They found out that she was the precious daughter of the Gu family who was born without crying. After her parents died, she became the leader of the black market, but for some reason, she suddenly ran away from home and lost all her memories, and then joined Yan Sect.

But since she had such an identity, it was not difficult to explain the origin of the Tianzhu Ling in Gu Peijiu's hands.

After a pause, Yan Sect's head suddenly realized and said, "No...you should have known it a long time ago."

Perhaps amnesia was just an excuse. After all, no matter how you looked at it, Gu Peijiu was half a black market person. If she wanted to enter Lingxi Peak, a famous and upright sect, she would have to use some extraordinary means. And these black-clad men with arrows were probably the guards of the black market.

Gu Peijiu did not deny it.

Xia Ge was hiding in the back and saw the black-clad men pulling their bows and arrows on the wall. She didn't bother with Yan Sect's head and Gu Peijiu's riddle, but quietly said to Gu Peijiu, "Can you lend me a bow after they leave? There's a bird thief on the mountain that annoys me every day, and I want to shoot down its nest at night."

Gu Peijiu transmitted her voice secretly, "Why do you need a bow?"

Xia Ge said, "I want to try the feeling of hitting the bullseye at fifty steps before I shoot the nest."

Gu Peijiu laughed and said, "Okay," then pointed to Chang Ren among the people, "That's Chang Ren. Now, you can try to hit his head at fifty steps."

Xia Ge's eyes lit up when she saw Chang Ren. She gritted her teeth and said, "Great idea! I'll practice hitting the bullseye before I shoot the nest!"

She hadn't used her "One-Hit Kill" for a long time, and she didn't know if this person's head was hard enough.

As soon as she spoke, a black-clad man beside her respectfully put the bow and arrow bag into the barrier without anyone noticing.

Chang Ren saw the look in Gu Peijiu's eyes when she looked at him.

The lips of the smiling girl were as cold as ice when she looked at him.

Chang Ren's heart trembled, and Yan Sect's head also saw the murderous intent in Gu Peijiu's eyes. He stepped forward and unintentionally blocked Chang Ren's path, saying, "Since that's the case, we won't force it." 

Xia Ge had just received the bow and was about to put an arrow on it when she saw Yan Sect's head blocking their way. She suddenly felt disappointed, "Ah, he blocked it."
"The bow feels great in hand and has a good amount of elasticity," said Gu Peiju, pausing for a moment. "It's okay, you can also try that person."

Xia Ge looked at Gu Peiju's "that person" and realized it was the leader of Lingxi Peak.

She couldn't help but be surprised. "Ah? Her? Did she... betray her master and destroy her ancestors?"

Gu Peiju glanced at her and calmly withdrew her gaze. "She bullied you," she listed the reasons. "She even called you a traitor, little witch."

Having regained all her memories, Gu Peiju had no emotional attachment to the leader of Lingxi Peak. The reason she guided herself to stay in Lingxi Peak this lifetime was because she had once vowed to protect everything behind her.

But what the strict leader did and said had seriously crossed Gu Peiju's bottom line.

The reason she didn't take action was ultimately because she was considering that the leader was still the head of Lingxi Peak. But if Xia Ge took action herself, then it wouldn't matter.

"It's okay, it's okay. She's not the first one to say that," Xia Ge said nervously. "Let's not betray our masters and destroy our ancestors... I've been freeloading in Lingxi Peak for three or four years, it's not good to do this."

...Well, if she wanted to kill her, she had plenty of opportunities.

Gu Peiju's eyes darkened slightly and she spoke to the "leaders of the righteous path" who were being aimed at with arrows. "Since Leader Yan has spoken, please leave, we won't see you off."

The crowd was frustrated, but also helpless. They weren't really afraid of the arrows that were imbued with spiritual power from these black-clothed archers. It was just that staying here had no meaning - Gu Peiju was like a barrier that they couldn't break through. Even without these black-clothed archers, they had no way to deal with her.

Rather than saying that these black-clothed archers were threatening them, it was more like Gu Peiju was giving them a way out.

This made it seem like it wasn't Gu Peiju who "fought against the heroes and made them retreat in a sorry state," but rather the heroes who were "surrounded by a group of black market thugs and had to temporarily avoid the sharp edge."

In any case, it was a mess.
