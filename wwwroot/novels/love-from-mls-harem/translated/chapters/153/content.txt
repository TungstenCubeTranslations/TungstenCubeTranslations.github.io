"...two people."

Something was tied around her neck, a thin and soft rope, with a small, icy object pressed against her chest like a piece of jade.

Her nervousness was slightly calmed. She wouldn't be harmed.

Chu Yi reached out and felt a small, icy object that felt like a small horn.

Then came the sound of rustling.

Her other hand was gently taken and placed on the warm handle of a knife. The boy's voice was light, "Whether it's two people or a hundred people, you still need to hold the knife handle properly."

"I know..."

"You won't be afraid if you hold the knife."

She wasn't powerful enough to protect herself, so there was no reason to deprive the child of the right to hold a knife.

Xia Ge's eyes dimmed slightly under her eyelashes.

...In the end, she was too dangerous to be around.

The Evil Ghost Camp was watching them, Ye Ze was still missing, and they could easily be killed.

She looked at the small dragon horn that had just been cut off from the Ghost Dragon Jade on Little Butterfly's chest, paused, and took her hand, chuckling softly.

"But it's just that..."

Little Butterfly felt her hand slowly moving forward, passing over the blade of the knife - the sharp edge of the blade was now covered with something, something thin and warm. Even when she passed over the blade, she didn't feel its sharpness.

The blade was sheathed.

"Well, you can have the knife, but sometimes you need a sheath more."

"A sheath..."

A sheath is something that covers the blade.

The little girl rubbed the small jade horn on her chest with her hand, "Then...what is this?"

"It's something that won't let you have nightmares." Xia Ge couldn't help but pat her head. "Okay, go to sleep. I promise you won't dream of any ghosts."
"...I'm not afraid of ghosts," Little Butterfly said. "It's my brother who's afraid, I'm not afraid at all."

Xia Ge replied, "Who's afraid? I'm not afraid!"

Little Butterfly said, "Brother is afraid, Brother is lying."

Xia Ge stopped arguing, "I didn't say you were afraid of ghosts, I meant you wouldn't have nightmares."

Little Butterfly stood on her tiptoes and touched her head, "It's okay, I'm here, Brother isn't afraid either."

Xia Ge said, "...Go to sleep."

"Okay." Little Butterfly obediently replied, snuggling into Xia Ge's arms and playing with the dagger. As she played with it, she asked uncertainly, "Is this firewood?"

The Meteor Star Dagger was extremely sharp, how could it be covered by a few pieces of firewood?

Xia Ge stared at the firewood she had touched a few times, and said with difficulty, "No, this is a sheath."

After a moment of silence, the little girl put the sheath that had been disassembled into pieces into her arms and said, "It's firewood."

Because it was all gone.

Xia Ge was depressed, "..."

Of course, there was only firewood in the woodshed.

"It's okay." The little girl hugged him tightly, her voice still muffled, "You are my sheath."

So, don't...leave me.

The memories abruptly stopped.

In reality, the rain was cold and Chu Yi stared at the bottomless abyss. All the past events were like a fleeting moment, and no one could understand her.

Life is just a cruel dream, and after waking up from the dream, no one loves her.

- No one.

No one can save her now.

The person who could save her fell in love with someone else.
"No one will love you.

And no one can save you.

- From beginning to end.

The only one who can save themselves is themselves.

Like that day, with the blood-stained meteor blade piercing through the heart of the offender in her hand.

The handle of the knife... must always be in her hand.

It seems that she has finally realized the reality, and the girl slowly loosened her grip on her clothes.

And her sheath.

She must take it back.

It's hers, she must take it back.

Either destroy it, or take it back.

It cannot belong to anyone else.

Otherwise, she will die.

She will die, and no one will save her.

The girl's gaze slowly became gloomy.

"Boom-"

Thunder suddenly appeared in the sky, followed by a dazzling flash that tore through the dark sky, illuminating the girl's dark and cold eyes.

"How is it?"

There were faint footsteps behind her, but the girl didn't turn around, her voice was extremely gloomy.

"Return to the young mistress..." The voice of the white-clothed person sounded hollow amidst the thunder, "The evil spirit mountain has appeared, the lord is seriously ill, and the Chang family has completely grasped the movements of the Chu family, waiting for your command."

If Chang Nian was here, he would be able to discover that this was the person from the Hundred Ghosts Cave who had been revealing the movements of the Chu family to the Chang family all along!"
"...It's been three years."

Chu Yi slowly stood up, her wet clothes dripping with water, her almond eyes sweet but with a hint of coldness, "What I lost...I will retrieve them one by one."

Three years of preparation, three years of planning, she wanted to make the family that once abandoned her taste the despair of losing everything.

The person who abandoned her...

Thinking of Xia Wuyin, Chu Yi closed her eyes and clenched her fists.

Time and time again, for three years, her Silver Butterfly had passed by her window countless times. She vividly remembered the maple leaves outside the person's window, from autumn to spring, from red to green. She also remembered that one winter, the silver-white snow covered the butterfly wings, and the person sat quietly on the rooftop playing the flute.

The flute sounded particularly beautiful and gentle, like a melody of homesickness. Every note carried longing.

That year's snow was the gentlest.

She knew that Danfeng's Xia Xiaozhang was not only skilled in alchemy, but also in formations. So her Silver Butterfly hid under the thick white snow, just to listen to her melancholic short song.

As she wished, her brother and Ye Ze went their separate ways.

Her brother never went to Jianfeng again.

She wanted to go see her, to ask her why she left back then, why she left without saying goodbye, why she abandoned her...

But she didn't dare.

The dead butterfly cannot fly, the loved one is as far away as the ends of the earth.

She was afraid of disappointment, afraid of being hurt again - that person was the closest to her heart, and perhaps an unintentional word would make her unable to get up again.

But Chu Yi couldn't just lie there like that. The things that the Chu family owed her, she had to get them back.

So she could only watch from afar, and then, with cold blood, quietly do what she should have done.

After a pause, Chu Yi brushed her wet hair, "How is the situation with the Chang family?"

"...It seems like they are destined to win against the Chu family."

Thunder was frequent, blurring the voice of the person in white.

"Occasionally giving a sweet taste is not a big deal." The girl looked up at the dense blackness above, her eyes no longer showing any sadness, only the cold and mercilessness of a superior, with a hint of bloodthirstiness, "But mine will always be mine."
"Yes," the person in white respectfully bowed their head.

Feeling someone's presence, the person in white disappeared in a flash.

The abyss was pitch black, with no end in sight.

The young girl's gaze was icy.

Not long after.

"What are you doing there?" The voice of the young man rang out, gentle and calm. "Why didn't you bring an umbrella? And where is your protective butterfly?"

Chu Yi stared at the bottomless abyss for a moment. "They're all dead."

"What nonsense are you talking about?" Ye Ze said. "It's cold and raining. Let's go back."

Three years had passed, and the young man had grown up. He wore a blue and white sword robe, and in the pouring rain, his eyebrows and eyes were gentle, his lips curved into a smile. He was a handsome young man.

"What nonsense," Chu Yi stood up. The rain was cold, and she turned back. "I didn't say anything nonsense."

She walked slowly to the young man's side, her voice tinged with a smile. "After all, no matter how cold the rain is, or how cold the butterfly corpses are, they can't compare to your heart, which is as hard as iron, and my heart, which is as dead as ashes."

Her brother had hidden and risked his life to save this person, even abandoning her in the end. She and her brother had endured countless hardships and wanderings for this person.

But now, this person had abandoned her brother.

How wonderful.

Chu Yi thought.

"Oh?" The young man tightened his grip on the umbrella handle, his eyelashes drooping to cover his pitch-black eyes. "What are you talking about?"

Are you trying to avoid something?

Are you afraid of something? Are you cowardly? Are you afraid of the pain of knowing the truth?

This person was someone she hated so much.
She wanted this person to die quickly. She hated this person who made her brother wander around, unable to find him, and suffer. She wanted to dig out his eyes and show them to her brother. She wanted to rip out his heart that occupied her brother's heart. She wanted to tear him apart into pieces - what was this little bit of pain?

Three years ago, she did it on purpose.

She deliberately helped him to go and kill Qin Yue.

Because - was it fear? Was it because she was scared when she saw Qin Yue?

After her brain, clouded by hatred, cleared up, did she become weak and suffer when she discovered some things that should not have been discovered?

Qin Yue and Xia Wuyin, do they look alike?

Do they look alike, the brother who rescued you from the demon camp, the brother who accompanied you through life and death, and your mortal enemy who wiped out your clan?

Very similar, right?

When she was choking her brother, did she feel that it was very similar?

Did she discover something that should not have been discovered?

It must have been painful. For three years, day and night, it must have been painful.

She dared not think, could not believe it, tried to forget, and even dared not look at it. She put herself in an unreasonable position, made herself ungrateful, and made herself a despicable person. Was it painful, Ye Ze?

If you are in pain, it's really good.

You and her are the same kind of people now.

But... it's not enough.

"It's nothing." Chu Yi smiled sweetly and said, "I just fell in love with someone, but she fell in love with someone else."

"So what?" Ye Ze asked.

How did he become so heartless?

"I just envy you for being able to let go so easily," Chu Yi looked at the gray sky, "Oh, but it's okay, you're a man after all."

"Or maybe..." Chu Yi thought for a moment and smiled innocently, "Successful people... don't care about trifles?"
A few years ago, the shadow of a young man flashed by. Ye Zexin's heart suddenly tightened, and there was a faint dark color in his eyes, but he didn't reply. He silently split his umbrella in half and gave it to Chu Yi, who was soaked through, and casually asked, "What happened to you today?"

They had an umbrella, but no rain, yet it was still very cold.

The heart was colder than the rain.

Chu Yi smiled and replied expressionlessly, "Guess."

Ye Zexin said, "I can't guess. Did someone from your family come today? Your father is seriously ill. Won't you go back and see him?"

Chu Yi looked at the bare stones of Jianfeng, and in the gaps between the piled stones, there was a faint green sprout poking its head out. That green sprout kept swaying in the wind and rain, but still stubbornly held its head up.

It was such a cute and competitive look.

Chu Yi walked out from under Ye Zexin's umbrella, and Ye Zexin was slightly startled. Chu Yi turned around and gave him a glance, and Ye Zexin froze, not moving again.

Chu Yi squatted in front of the small green sprout, her long eyelashes drooping. The wind and rain fell on her, and she murmured, "Seriously ill."

Ye Zexin made a sound of agreement.

Chu Yi reached out and shielded the green sprout from the wind and rain. Her long eyelashes were stained with raindrops. "I understand now."
