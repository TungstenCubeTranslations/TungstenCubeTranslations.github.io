Chapter 151: The Heartless Rain

The rain was pouring down relentlessly, as if the heavens themselves were weeping. The streets of the city were deserted, with only the occasional sound of footsteps echoing through the empty alleyways. 

In a small apartment on the outskirts of town, a lone figure sat hunched over a desk, illuminated only by the dim light of a single lamp. The person was a translator, working tirelessly to bring a Chinese novel to an English-speaking audience. 

Despite the sound of the rain pounding against the window, the translator remained focused on their task. They knew that every word they translated was a step closer to completing their work and bringing the story to life for a new audience. 

As the night wore on, the rain continued to fall, but the translator refused to be deterred. They worked through the storm, their fingers flying over the keyboard as they brought the characters and their world to life. 

Finally, as the first light of dawn began to filter through the window, the translator sat back with a sigh of satisfaction. The novel was complete, translated from Chinese to English, and ready to be shared with the world. 

Though the rain had been heartless, the translator's dedication had been unwavering, and the result was a work of art that would touch the hearts of readers around the globe.
