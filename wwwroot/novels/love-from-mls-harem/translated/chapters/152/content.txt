This kiss was hot and crazy in the cold rain, slowly becoming more gentle and lingering. At first, it was intense and wild, with their lips and tongues intertwined and the back of her head held tightly. It was like a burst of long-hidden desire and darkness, without pity or restraint. In the midst of the madness, there seemed to be a hint of resentment, but behind that resentment, there was also tenderness.

Xia Ge felt like she couldn't breathe anymore. In the midst of the stormy wind and rain, she was like a small boat, enduring the violent taking. She opened her eyes wide, her head feeling a little dizzy and confused, not knowing what was happening or what had happened. Suddenly... it became like this.

She just... didn't want her to leave.

Why, why did it become like this?

She didn't know if this was right or wrong, or even understand her own heart.

But she knew.

She didn't want to lose... this person.

Xia Wu Yin, who had always lived aimlessly, didn't want to lose this person.

She had always, always, always lived for others.

For Dou Dou, for Ye Ze, for Chu Yi, for every person she met on this inexplicable journey, for every word they said to her. She wandered, collected the Ghost Dragon Jade, saved Ye Ze, and obtained the Heavenly Eye Grass.

But now, she didn't want to do this anymore.

She wanted to be selfish for once.

She knew that some people, regardless of love or anything else, would disappear if they were missed. She couldn't figure out if she liked him or loved him, but she knew that Xia Ge didn't want to lose this person.

Xia Ge felt like she couldn't breathe anymore, and she didn't know what to do, just standing there stupidly.

The kiss slowly became tender.

Gu Pei Jiu's voice was hoarse, "Breathe."

Xia Ge: "Oh..."

As her hazy mind slowly regained its senses, in that moment of clarity, she knew that this was wrong.
Xia Ge tugged at her senior sister's clothes, her pupils slowly tightening -

No, this is not right, it cannot be like this.

You cannot be so selfish.

This is not acceptable, this is not fair, it is not fair to senior sister at all.

Do you know what love is?

Do you know how to respond to a girl's love?

Do you know how to love a girl?

You know nothing.

You don't understand anything, you're just lonely, you're just greedy for someone's tenderness, you just feel that she is good to you, so you want to be good to her.

But do you love her? Are you willing to take the initiative to kiss her? Can you love her like she loves you? Touch her like a lover, love her?

- You don't know how to love her.

But you do know, you understand, as long as you reach out your hand, she will grab it, she will respond to you, without hesitation, without reservation.

But... will you hold her hand forever?

Will you? Can you?

Xia Wuyin, who didn't know the ending, Xia Xiaozhangling who took responsibility, Xia Ge who carried the name of a puppeteer, do they have the ability to love someone? Or, can you protect her?

...None, not even one.

The only thing you can do, from beginning to end, is

She is good to you, and you are good to her.

So, why are you so selfish? Is it because she loves you?

The wind and rain were shaking.

Gu Peijiu could feel the stiffness of the person in her arms very clearly.
It was probably because she was too impatient.

The person in her arms carried too much burden, but received too little in return.

She dared not love, and sought it in vain. In the end, after everything had passed, she could only look at everything with indifference, play along with the world, and laugh innocently.

She paused for a moment, let out a sigh, and held the person tightly in her arms.

The cold rain made their body temperature feel scorching hot.

It was scorching hot, but also warm.

In the corner, a silver butterfly quietly fell from a branch, and then turned into scattered dust, disappearing in the pouring rain like the withered maple leaves in autumn, unnoticed by anyone.

Xia Ge didn't know what to say. After a long time, she felt that she should say something - no, she must say something.

In life, there are many things that cannot be obtained, and because of the ability to endure the inability to obtain, Xia Ge had many things that she couldn't get.

It's just that the inability to obtain is very bitter.

She couldn't bear to let this person not get what they wanted.

She asked softly, "What did senior sister come here for?"

The soft white hand gently stroked her wet hair, slowly smoothing it down. With one hand wet, Gu Peijiu whispered softly, "It's raining."

So.

"...to see you."

The sound of the wind and rain, the rustling of the leaves, the piercing sound of thunder, and all the sounds in the world, only her voice and demeanor could sound so gentle.

...what should she do, say sorry? Or say that she couldn't... or just laugh it off, as if nothing had happened?

How could she not hurt this person?
How can I be more gentle?

Why did she rush out? Why did she grab her senior sister? Why? She couldn't do anything, she couldn't give anything, why was she so impulsive?

Why?

Xia Ge's voice was slightly hoarse, "I..."

Gu Peijiu's eyes darkened as she covered Xia Ge's lips with her finger, her long eyelashes fluttering like butterfly wings. "The evil spirit mountain has appeared."

Xia Ge's eyes widened slightly.

"I'll go," she said.

"Wait for me to come back," Gu Peijiu's voice was gentle. "Then give me an answer."

==

On the sword peak, on the rocky cliff.

It was raining heavily, it was cold, it was freezing.

A girl hugged her knees and sat quietly on the most protruding part of the cliff. Her pair of pitch-black eyes looked at the abyss and the cold stream. The cold rain soaked her hair, her wet clothes clung tightly to her body, outlining her slender legs and graceful figure.

What is love?

Chu Yi placed her hand on her chest, her fair hand slowly exerting force, creasing her wet clothes. She was wearing a dragon jade horn that was close to her body. Her finger bones turned pale, and little by little, she embedded the right horn into her palm -

She couldn't breathe.

It was so uncomfortable.

Chu Yi's face gradually turned pale.

Everything that Silver Butterfly saw was like a fatal poison, pouring into her heart without leaving any room.

...It was so uncomfortable.

It was so uncomfortable, so uncomfortable, so uncomfortable - 

Why? Why... it was supposed to be hers alone, why did it turn out like this?
"It hurts, it's painful, it's uncomfortable, more painful than when her mother destroyed her eyes, more bitter than when she was demoted from her legitimate daughter status, more uncomfortable than knowing her brother didn't want her.

She accepted and endured all of these.

But why- why didn't her brother want her, yet he liked someone else?

It's so uncomfortable, so painful, she's almost dying, it's so uncomfortable that she's almost dying- the rain is so cold, so cold, who will save her, who can save her?!

The only answer to her is the pouring rain.

The cold, ruthless rain.

So cold.

"...Brother, I'm cold." Chu Yi curled up on the cliff, murmuring, "I... am cold."

She stared at the gray sky, her empty eyes devoid of stars and moon, and her palm shaped like a dragon horn.

In a daze, she returned to a long time ago.

At that time, her brother had retrieved the Ghost Dragon Jade, looking for Ye Ze while hiding from the people of the Evil Ghost Camp.

They hid in a family's woodshed.

The woodshed was also cold, but not as cold as this.

"Are you cold?"

The boy's voice was low, "Lean against me."

Little Butterfly's voice was soft, "I'm very cold, Brother will be cold too."

The boy coaxed her with a slight smile, "Little Butterfly, come closer and you won't be cold anymore. If one person is cold, it might be very, very cold, but if two people are cold, they won't be cold when they're together."

The two snuggled together, curled up in the corner, and her brother's embrace was not cold at all, it was warm, very warm.

But that night, perhaps because she was too exhausted, she dreamt of many things she didn't want to dream of- at that time, a sharp dagger was aimed at her eyes, and then, fiercely hacked down-

"Ah-"

She suddenly woke up."
She seemed to be embraced by someone, feeling warm all over. But her heart was as cold as ice.

"What's wrong?" The boy's voice showed no sign of sleepiness. When he asked her, it was gentle. Chu Yi realized belatedly that he had not rested.

"I...I dreamed of a ghost." Chu Yi pulled on the boy's clothes, thinking of that knife. After a moment, she continued, "But I'm not afraid of ghosts."

Xia Ge comforted her by patting her head, "It must have been a very scary ghost, but don't be afraid. Brother is here."

"I'm not afraid of ghosts," Chu Yi said firmly. But at that moment, she didn't realize she was gripping the boy's clothes so tightly that her knuckles were turning white. "I killed the ghost with a knife."

No one would hurt her anymore.

No one could hurt her.

"You little liar." The boy's voice had a hint of amusement. "If you're not afraid, why did you scream?"

The little girl blushed, "I didn't scream, I...I wasn't scared!"

"Oh, I see. I'm not scared either. I'm the bravest little butterfly," the boy teased.

The little girl let go of his clothes and silently took out her knife. The Meteor Blade shone brightly, reflecting the starlight.

Xia Ge said, "..." He had lost.

"I'm not afraid of ghosts." The little butterfly held the knife firmly and spoke with determination. "I'll become stronger and stand in front of you. No one can hurt you."

Just like no one could hurt her.

"So," Xia Ge looked at the knife point less than three inches away from his chest and said helplessly, "before that, you have to learn to aim the knife at the enemy."

"But someone taught me," the little butterfly's voice was childish, and her hand holding the knife handle trembled slightly. "The handle of the knife should always be in my hand."

Xia Ge said, "..." 

"Okay then," he said, "fearless and super powerful Miss Butterfly, can you let me play with your knife handle for a while?"

The little butterfly hesitated for a moment, then handed him the knife, "Okay."
Xia Ge teased her, "Isn't the handle of the knife supposed to be held in your own hand forever?"

"But I'm afraid," Little Butterfly's voice was small, "I'm afraid I'll hurt you."

Little Butterfly gently tugged at her clothes, "I've always been...alone."

"When you're alone, the handle of the knife must be in your own hand..."

But now, someone told her that when you're alone, it's very cold, but when two people are together, it's not cold anymore.

She slowly put her head on Xia Ge's chest, hugging her tightly, "Teach me, what does it look like when two people are together?"

"Clearly...when the handle of the knife is in your own hand, it will never be wrong."

"But why do I get...so scared when you're around?"

She was afraid that the knife in her hand would hurt her brother, and she didn't know what to do.

Xia Ge was slightly startled, holding the meteor dagger in her hand, still warm from the girl's touch.

For a long time, the little girl didn't get a response from the young man. She leaned against his chest, listening to the sound of his heartbeat, feeling warm and at ease.

Even if her brother never answered her, it didn't matter.

Because she had thought of it.

It was...

"Snap."

The sound of a sharp blade cutting through something was crisp, almost instantaneous. The little girl's hair stood on end and she became alert!
