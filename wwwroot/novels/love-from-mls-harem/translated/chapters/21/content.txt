The old man finished speaking and waved his hand. "It's currently the time when the Qing and Huang seasons are not prosperous at the Lingxi Peak, and the Demon Cult is also stirring... Jiu'er, if you have any good sword apprentices, send them to the Sword Peak as well."

"Yes," Gu Peiju replied with a bow.

"Other than that, there's nothing else. You may leave."

After leaving the council hall, Gu Peiju looked at the brightly blooming red embroidered ball flowers at the entrance of the hall, her dark eyes calm and unruffled.

Currently, Lingxi Peak was indeed not prosperous. Among the three peaks, Dan Peak, Sword Peak, and Beast Peak, only Dan Peak and Beast Peak had formal senior apprentices.

Dan Peak was declining, with many disciples learning alchemy, and there were few new talents. Therefore, the senior apprentices of Dan Peak could be appointed by the sect leader with just a word. Baili Qing, the senior apprentice of Beast Peak, stood out with his extraordinary talent in taming beasts and became the senior apprentice.

Sword Peak was the most special.

The inner disciples of Sword Peak were all the pride of their families, practicing martial arts since childhood. Each of them was proud and arrogant, and there were many new talents.

Therefore, they naturally coveted the position of senior apprentice, and the competition for the position at Sword Peak was particularly fierce, with the selection process being especially strict.

The "Sword Edge Asks the Spirit," which inner disciples of Sword Peak must participate in every three years, is the most important reference standard for selecting senior apprentices.

The inner disciples who have won the "Sword Edge Asks the Spirit" for three consecutive sessions can be directly promoted to senior apprentices of Sword Peak. Those who have won two or one session will become candidates for senior apprentices.

The newcomer who won the "Sword Edge Asks the Spirit" for three consecutive sessions in previous years is now the acting senior apprentice of Sword Peak, Chang Lan. However, Chang Lan refused the position of senior apprentice under the family's requirements and chose to go down the mountain and join "Zhi."

But Sword Peak cannot be without a leader. Under the sect leader's request, Chang Lan still agreed to come back and temporarily assume the position of senior apprentice of Sword Peak until the next senior apprentice is selected.

The sect leader of Lingxi Peak will be selected from the senior apprentices of the three peaks.

Generally, it is the senior apprentice of Sword Peak who becomes the sect leader of Lingxi Peak.

That is the newcomer who truly stands out among the pride of their families.

The warm sunshine shone down, and the girl in the red and white maple clothes quietly looked at the towering mountain not far away, her gaze indifferent.

After Chang Lan left six years ago, only one person had won the "Sword Edge Asks the Spirit" twice and became the only candidate for senior apprentice of Sword Peak.

Chu Yao, the pride of the Chang'an Chu family.

After Chang Lan, no one could match her with a cold sword.
If nothing unexpected happens, after the third Sword Edge Asking Spirit, this proud daughter of heaven can step into the Lingxi Peak Conference Hall with the identity of a senior disciple of the Sword Peak.

Chang'an is the legendary imperial city, while Chu is the imperial surname from a hundred years ago.

Noble families with royal blood have an inherent arrogance that is untouchable.

Gu Peiju murmured softly, "The eldest daughter of the Chang'an Chu family..."

Chu Yao.

Three days later.

Suxi is a small stream that flows down from the top of Danfeng Mountain, full of spiritual energy. A small Dange was built by the stream.

Because of the abundant spiritual energy, the success rate of alchemy is extremely high, but only inner disciples who submit special applications have the opportunity to use the Suxi Dan Pavilion.

The warm sunlight passes through the mountains and is cut into countless small spots by the dense leaves, scattered on the clean grass, some falling into the clear and transparent stream, reflecting the scales of the fish swimming underneath, and the pebbles are colorful.

Gu Peiju wore a red and white Danfeng plain clothes, with delicate and exquisite red maple cuffs. Her long black hair was tied into a bundle with a red hairband, and her soft and gentle hair draped over her snow-white neck. She looked at a phoenix tree in front of the Dan Pavilion. A cicada was lying on the tree with its wings trembling weakly, buzzing.

Noon had passed.

The person who should have come still hadn't arrived.

There was no expression on Gu Peiju's delicate porcelain-like face, she just quietly waited in front of the fiery red door of the Dan Pavilion.

Gu Peiju and her companions were very patient.

However, the fact proved that some people wouldn't come just because you were willing to wait.

The scorching sun slowly went down the mountain, and the cicadas' cries gradually became lighter and no longer sounded weak like in the afternoon.

Gu Peiju stood at the door for a long time, and her slender eyelashes were tinged with a bit of frost.

--He didn't come.

He won't come.

Gu Peiju waved her sleeve and left.

The Suxi stream water was still clear under the moonlight.
On the other side, Gu Peiju waited for someone by the stream all afternoon, while Xia Ge happily ran to a small tavern in the neighboring village to drink all afternoon.

The system couldn't help but speak up.

"Host, did you forget something?" 

Xia Ge picked up a peanut and pretended to be innocent. "Huh? Did I forget something?"

"I remember that Senior Sister asked you to refine medicine today...?" 

"You must be mistaken. I don't remember that," Xia Ge said.

"Then why did you come here to drink without telling Ye Ze?" 

"Ye Ze has bad breath. Bringing him here to drink would ruin the taste of the wine," Xia Ge said with a straight face.

"..." 

You skipped class and came here to drink secretly from Ye Ze. You're just guilty!

At this moment, Ye Ze, with his bad breath, was sitting in the Dan Hall where they usually held meetings.

Although it was still early in the night, the Dan Hall was brightly lit, and Ye Ze lowered his head, accepting Senior Sister's cold scrutiny.

"...I told him!" 

Ye Ze cursed Xia Wu Yin in his heart. That stinky brat skipped Senior Sister's remedial class and now it was his turn to be here, delivering the news!

"Where did he go?" 

Gu Peiju's voice was cold.

"...I'm not sure," Ye Ze said, sweating profusely.

"Where does he usually go?" Gu Peiju looked at the nervous boy with pale black eyes.

"..." 

Ye Ze was at a loss.

Xia Wu Yin had too many usual places to go.
"Where did he say he was going?"

Gu Peijiu could tell from Ye Ze's expression that he was struggling. "Where do you think he would go?"

Ye Ze thought for a moment, uncertain. "...the tavern?"

Gu Peijiu's eyes turned cold. "No."

Ye Ze: "..."

From her tone, it sounded like he had already been there...

He had been there!?

Sweat dripped from Ye Ze's forehead. "Teahouse, brothel, tavern, and..."

...and the Beast Peak Beast-Keeping Mountain, where he often went to dig for bird eggs.

"No."

Gu Peijiu stood up, her red and white Danfeng plain clothes swaying in the flickering candlelight, her long eyelashes trembling slightly. She gazed quietly at Ye Ze, her voice clear like a babbling brook. "Ye Ze, he's not in the villages at the foot of the mountain, nor is he at the Lingxi Peak."

Waiting for Ye Ze's response, Gu Peijiu looked at the flickering candlelight, her black stone-like eyes shimmering.

Why?

Danfeng was busy with many affairs.

But why had she waited for an outer disciple at the Susu Creek for so long?

Clearly, he was just an outer disciple... never mind.

Even if he was suspicious, with her in charge, no matter how cunning the other party was, they wouldn't have much of an impact on Danfeng.

Why... did she care so much?

Ye Ze was taken aback.

...if he wasn't in those places, where would he go?

-"Ah, Brother Ye, I heard there's a small tavern in the Mo Family Village three miles away that does really good business..."
——"When are we going to that place for a drink?"

Ye Ze's temple twitched slightly.

Gu Peiju looked at him, with a shallow shadow in her eyes.

Ye Ze hesitated for a moment, "Master Sister, Xia Wuyin... might be at the Tao Yuan Tavern in the Mo Family Village..."

As soon as he finished speaking, a red shadow flashed before his eyes. When Ye Ze looked up again, there was no trace of his Master Sister.

She came and went like the wind.

On the other side, Xia Ge was still happily drinking the unique peach blossom wine of the Mo Family Village, chewing peanuts, and listening to the anecdotes of the rivers and lakes.

"Is there any news about the elusive Yimei in the world recently?"

"Ah, how can we easily catch such a powerful Yimei..."

"Besides the current Demon Cult Leader's 'Blood-Stained Spring and Autumn' and the Chu Family's 'Chu Knife Sacrifice Spirit', it is really hard to find a third set of ancient Yimei..."

"..."

Yimei.

A troublesome thing that everyone loves.

Xia Ge remembered the setting of Yimei in the original book.

The dead puppets have "emotions" given by the puppet masters, and these emotions will emerge from the puppet's body when it is destroyed, becoming wandering remnants with the ability to possess. These remnants combine with wandering evil spirits or other miscellaneous spirits, and can possess clothes or utensils, preserving the power that the soul had before it died, becoming Yimei.

When someone comes into contact with them, there are only two outcomes.

Either they are controlled by powerful Yimei and become a puppet of Yimei.

Or they control Yimei and become the master of Yimei's power.

And the ancient Yimei that those people just talked about...

In legend, there were gods in the ancient Fengyue Continent.
However, all those gods have fallen, and the reason is unknown.

The ancient clothing spirits, also known as puppet remnants, are formed by combining the souls of gods with clothing and taking shape.

Clothes that can accept the souls of gods are naturally extraordinary.

So whenever an ancient clothing spirit appears, it is natural for the world to change, and people will compete for it endlessly. But few people can truly control these ancient clothing spirits.

Most of them are used for worship and burning incense. After all, the ancient clothing spirits contain divine souls. Even if they don't borrow their power, just getting a little protection is enough to make life smooth sailing and everything go smoothly.

"When will I have a powerful clothing spirit too?" Xia Ge drank his wine and sighed.

"After passing the exam, you will naturally have one."

A clear voice sounded like spring water, and the entire tavern suddenly became quiet. Everyone looked at the door in astonishment, where a beautiful woman draped in moonlight, like a fairy, had appeared.

Senior sister?!?!

Xia Ge's hand trembled, and his wine glass shook, suddenly slipping from his hand -

Oh my god, is she drunk today, the one who can drink a thousand cups without getting drunk, Xia Wu Yin?!?!
