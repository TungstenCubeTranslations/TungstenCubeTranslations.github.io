On this side, Chu Yi could only see a faint glimmer of light with her eyes closed. When she opened them again, everything slowly became brighter. The enthusiastic "eunuch" from before seemed a bit strange to Chu Yi, but she couldn't put her finger on why. It was just... familiar?

She called out "stop" but there were still many blind spots in her vision, and she couldn't see clearly. By the time she could see clearly, the person she told to stop had already disappeared.

Chu Yi thought to herself, "That guy is definitely strange!" She stood up with pursed lips and a slightly gloomy expression. She lightly hummed and casually waved her sleeve. The exquisite butterfly on her sleeve began to flutter as if it had come to life. Chu Yi's voice softened, "Butterfly Soul, what did you see just now?"

In the next moment, the girl's clothes lit up and her black pupils shone with a butterfly-like white light. In almost an instant, Chu Yi saw everything that had just happened through the eyes of the silver butterfly on her sleeve.

Under the soft sunlight shining through the old wooden window of the bookshelf, a red-haired boy looked at her. Because she was only borrowing the butterfly's eyes, Chu Yi couldn't hear his voice, but she could see his eyes. It was only for a moment, but Chu Yi felt like this person's gaze had stepped on the most painful part of her heart!

This kind of gaze... only made her more angry!

"Hey..." The girl's voice was tinged with a cold chill, full of anger and hatred. "Who are you..."

There was no one around, so of course no one could answer her, but Chu Yi was only talking to herself. She saw the boy wave his hand towards her eyes, as if he had realized she couldn't see anymore. In the midst of her astonishment, a hint of complexity and heartache appeared in his eyes.

But in this situation...

Heartache?

Or sympathy?

Chu Yi only felt that he was sympathizing with her.
Ridiculous.

Really ridiculous.

Who does he think he is? Who is he sympathizing with? Who is he pitying?!

"Who do you think you are..."

- Really, what kind of trash can come and sympathize with her?

She's just blind, not stupid!

What kind of trash can pity her?! Who is worthy of sympathizing with her?!

Chu Yin would rather be trampled in the mud, and everyone pointing at her spine calling her a slut, calling her a disaster, rather than this useless sympathy and pity!

Chu Yin felt a burst of evil fire in her heart, the evil fire burning wildly in her heart, forcing her to relive all the bitterness, despair, darkness and pain she had experienced.

"Who do you think you are?! Why do you pity me?! Why?!"

"Boom--"

With a loud noise, the fragile bookshelf collapsed suddenly. The servants rushed over, only to see the sunlight shining down, and in the dust and pages, there were the icy black eyes of their young miss.

"Second Miss..."

After the outburst, Chu Yin took a breath and her vision went black again. She stumbled back two steps, and the servants rushed up to help her, only to be violently pushed away by the girl. "Get out of here! Don't touch me!"

Unexpectedly, her movement was too strong, and something in her pocket was thrown out fiercely, bouncing a few times on the ground before finally settling quietly on a page of the book.

Chu Yin's gaze fell on that thing. Her pupils shrank slightly.

It was a candy.

The candy wrapper shook open slightly, revealing a pink candy wrapped in cherry blossom petals. In the warm sunshine, it lay quietly on the page of the book, peaceful as if it had entered a painting.

Chu Yin stared at the candy, dazed.

It seemed that someone had said this to her a long, long time ago.

- If you feel that life is too bitter.
——Just eat the candy.

But...what about that person?

Chu Yi hesitated for a moment, then stumbled over to the page of the book. Finally, she knelt down with a "plop," trembling hands carefully reaching for the candy. However, in the instant she touched it, she recoiled as if shocked, covering her eyes with her hands.

What about that person?!

After a while, tears slowly flowed through her fingers, drop by drop, soaking the page.

"Brother..."

You don't want me anymore.

It's really painful.

= =

After Xia Ge left, he naturally didn't know about the commotion upstairs. He only knew that he had just reached the corner of the stairs on the second floor when he heard a loud "boom" from the third floor, as if something had collapsed.

The disciples below were in an uproar, curious about what was happening on the third floor. Some who enjoyed watching the excitement even wanted to climb up to see the situation. Xia Ge thought of the girl leaning against the bookshelf, with a lifeless look in her eyes, and looked at the crowd eager to watch the fun. Suddenly, a clever idea struck him. He shouted at the top of his lungs, "Hey, hey, I think I just saw a ground-level pill formula in the pill formula area. I don't know if it's real or not!"

The people upstairs immediately focused their attention on Xia Ge.

"Who are you?"

"Hey, isn't this Xia Wuyin?"

"I'll be damned, he found a ground-level pill formula?"

"Where is it, where is it!?"

"..."

Xia Ge said, "I don't know either, come with me and take a look."

Someone noticed something was wrong, "Wait a minute, isn't the pill formula area on the first floor? How did you come down from the third floor?"

Xia Ge said, "I saw it before, but I didn't pay attention. Now that I think about it, hey, it looks a lot like a ground-level pill formula."

"Really?"
"Come with me and see for yourself!"

"..."

Some believed, some didn't, and some were skeptical, but their attention was all diverted from the third floor. Xia Ge led the way to the Danfang District, and upon arrival, someone asked, "Where is the prefecture-level Danfang?"

Xia Ge pretended to walk up to a bookshelf, suddenly looking shocked and panicked. "Huh, where did the Danfang go? I just saw it, it couldn't have been taken, could it?"

"Huh?"

"Are you trying to trick us?"

"..."

Just as Xia Ge was about to speak nonsense, a faint voice suddenly spoke up.

"Prefecture-level Danfang?"

Xia Ge's back stiffened, and the disciples who followed her were stunned at the sight behind her. Xia Ge turned around stiffly and saw Gu Peijiu at the end of the bookshelf.

The young girl wore a red and white maple dress, her face as white as jade. She stood at the end of the bookshelf, twisting a page of Danfang in her slender white hand. Her long eyelashes framed a pair of black eyes that were calm and unruffled. She looked at Xia Ge and asked, "Are you looking for the prefecture-level Danfang?"

Xia Ge's false smile suddenly became stiff. "Uh...this...I..."

The prefecture-level Danfang was just something she made up to divert attention from the third floor. There was no such thing. 

Gu Peijiu walked up to her, holding a torn piece of Danfang, and asked, "Is this it?"

Xia Ge: "..." The Danfang was really made up. None of them were the real thing.

But looking at the suspicious eyes of the crowd, Xia Ge didn't dare to look at Gu Peijiu and said, "Ah...yes, yes, that's it."

Although the crowd did not speak, they looked at the half piece of Danfang in Gu Peijiu's hand and then at Xia Ge's evasive expression with suspicion.

Gu Peijiu raised her voice slightly, "Hmm?"

Xia Ge snapped out of her thoughts and immediately said confidently, "Yes! That's it! I saw this one!" 

The crowd: "..."
Gu Peijiu paused for a moment and glanced at her, "This is a fragment of a ground-level pill recipe that I left here before. It's useless, and I just wanted to retrieve it. Maybe you saw it just now."

She paused again, "If you want to see it, I'll leave it here."

After speaking, she placed the fragment on the bookshelf. However, no one dared to touch it. Gu Peijiu looked at Xia Ge and said, "Come with me."

Xia Ge replied, "Oh."

Gu Peijiu led her to the second floor.

The people left behind looked at each other and then at the ground-level fragment on the bookshelf. After a few seconds of silence, they rushed forward.

"Mine!!"

"Nonsense, I saw it first!"

"Bullshit, I was the first one!!"

"..."

The commotion attracted the disciple in charge on the first floor. He rushed over and scolded them, "Hey, what are you doing? If you want to fight, go outside. Don't gather here and fight!!"

The second floor was well-lit. Gu Peijiu brought Xia Ge up there without saying a word. She casually picked up a book from the shelf and started to read.

Xia Ge followed her, feeling a little nervous. She glanced at the book in Gu Peijiu's hand.

"Carved Wood."

...What was that about?

Xia Ge turned her head and looked at the section of the bookshelf. She realized that it was the "Folk Arts and Crafts" section.

The girl in front of her was flipping through the book with a straight back, and the atmosphere was quiet.

Xia Ge couldn't calm down. She blinked her eyes and tried to make small talk, "Senior Sister seems to be interested in carving?"

Gu Peijiu's hand paused as she turned the page. After a while, she glanced sideways at Xia Ge.

Behind her was a young man in a coarse linen robe, holding a book and tying a red hairband. His hair was slightly messy, but his eyes were bright. The dragon jade that was originally hanging from his waist and missing a corner was gone, replaced by a black-haired wooden doll.


The doll had black hair, black eyes, and delicate white skin with red lips, making it extremely cute.

Gu Peijiu made a sound of agreement and put the book back, her voice indifferent. "Just flipping through it."

"Oh..." Xia Ge responded.

Gu Peijiu glanced at the doll on her waist and asked, "What about your jade?"

"Huh? The jade?" Xia Ge realized that Gu Peijiu was referring to the Ghost Dragon Jade. She scratched her head. "Uh, that belongs to someone else. I have to return it."

Seeing that Gu Peijiu didn't say anything and was just staring at her doll, Xia Ge didn't know what to do. She felt a little embarrassed to say that she had carved it herself, so she pretended not to notice that Gu Peijiu was looking at her doll.

"Marionette," Gu Peijiu said.

"Huh?" Xia Ge asked.

Gu Peijiu looked at her and repeated, "Marionette."

Xia Ge couldn't pretend anymore. "Uh, this marionette...it was a gift from someone else!"

Gu Peijiu looked into her eyes.

Xia Ge felt a little guilty and looked away. "Haha, it's pretty, right?"

Gu Peijiu pondered for a moment. "Do you like it?"

"It's...okay," Xia Ge replied.

Gu Peijiu made a sound of agreement and was about to continue reading her book when she suddenly lifted her head and seemed to have seen something behind Xia Ge. Her eyes narrowed slightly, and she pulled Xia Ge behind her.

Xia Ge was caught off guard and was pulled behind Gu Peijiu. The bookshelf and the red and white maple-clad girl blocked her view. Xia Ge let out a cry of surprise but immediately shut her mouth after hearing a voice. She curled up behind Gu Peijiu, clutching her clothes tightly and making herself even more hidden.

She heard Chu Yi's cold and gentle voice drifting from behind the bookshelf. "Who was the person with the red hairband just now?"

The servant who followed her cautiously replied, "I'm not sure."

The servant was at a loss. This was the Danfeng Library, and although there were disciples from Jianfeng and Shoufeng, most people wore the red hairbands of Danfeng. How could the concept be so vague?

When Chu Yi walked to the shelf where Gu Peijiu was, she paused for a moment and glanced in Gu Peijiu's direction. Gu Peijiu was holding a book that she had just opened, but she felt the other's gaze and slightly raised her head, turning her body to block the person behind her. Her eyes were pitch black, with a hint of coldness.
Chuyi felt a slight sting from the look she received. She furrowed her brows and her gaze turned cold. Finally, she looked at Gu Peijiu and a chilly smile appeared on her lips. "It's okay, I'll find it myself." With that, she left, flipping her sleeves.

As Chuyi's voice gradually faded away, Xia Ge breathed a sigh of relief.

Gu Peijiu held a book in her hand and glanced at Xia Ge, her voice indifferent. "Why are you avoiding her?"

Xia Ge didn't know how to explain, so she pretended to be clueless. "I just... wanted to avoid her."

Gu Peijiu lowered her head slightly and looked at Xia Ge's hand, which was grabbing her belt.

Following her gaze, Xia Ge realized that she was still holding onto the other's clothes, or rather, her belt. She quickly let go and stammered, "Ah, that, it wasn't intentional, I..."

Gu Peijiu seemed to have not noticed that Xia Ge had grabbed her belt and continued to ask, "If you wanted to avoid her, then why did you go up to her just now?"

Evidently, Gu Peijiu had seen Xia Ge sneak up to Chuyi when she wasn't looking.

Xia Ge felt embarrassed and said, "Oh, so you saw that..."

Gu Peijiu made a sound of agreement and said she had seen Xia Ge as soon as she entered the book depository.

As for following Chuyi to the third floor, Gu Peijiu thought that she just happened to have a book she wanted to read on the third floor and followed her up.

Well, Xia Ge accidentally saw Chuyi receiving candy from someone, that's all.

Xia Ge hesitated for a moment and said earnestly, "I felt like she needed help at the time."

She was really a helpful disciple of the Danfeng Academy.

Gu Peijiu fell silent for a moment, apparently thinking. After a while, the book in her hand slipped and fell to the ground with a "clatter."

Xia Ge was taken aback.

Gu Peijiu looked at her seriously and said, "I need help too."

Xia Ge: "..." No, no, that's not what I meant, you...
In a moment, Xia Ge picked up the book with a black face and handed it to Gu Peijiu, saying, "You better hold onto this."

Gu Peijiu took the book with one hand and said "Hmm" before extending her other hand to Xia Ge. Her hand was fair as jade, palm facing up as she held it out to Xia Ge without saying a word, just looking at her.

Xia Ge was confused, wondering why Gu Peijiu was holding out her hand when she already gave her the book. As she stood there, Gu Peijiu turned her head slightly, her long eyelashes fluttering as her black eyes reflected Xia Ge's bewildered expression.

After a moment, Gu Peijiu slowly withdrew her hand. Xia Ge didn't know why, but she suddenly felt like Gu Peijiu was a little unhappy.

Why is she unhappy now?

Gu Peijiu left with the book, her proud figure in the red and white maple dress disappearing from sight. Xia Ge couldn't help but feel a sense of regret emanating from her.

Wait a minute...

Thinking of Chu Yi, Xia Ge suddenly understood something, but wasn't entirely sure.

"Hey! Senior sister! Wait, wait..."

Gu Peijiu didn't turn around, but her steps slowed down. Xia Ge hurried over and grabbed her sleeve.

Gu Peijiu looked at Xia Ge's hand and walked out of the bookshelf area where there were more people. Xia Ge didn't want to be too presumptuous, so she sheepishly let go of Gu Peijiu's sleeve and smiled, "Um, just now, thank you."

Gu Peijiu looked at Xia Ge's eyes, her pupils reflecting her gaze. Xia Ge thought for a moment, then boldly said, "Senior sister, can you hold out your hand?"

Gu Peijiu lowered her eyes and looked at her for a moment before obediently holding out her hand.

Xia Ge grinned and put a candy in her palm. The fair as jade palm held a pink candy wrapped in transparent paper.

"I'm offering a small gift, I haven't tasted it myself, so I don't know if it's good." Xia Ge didn't know if her guess was correct, so she turned her head and looked out the window, feeling a little embarrassed for the first time. "I don't usually give candy when I help people, but... oh well."

If the black-cloaked person in the black market was this person...

...it was just a piece of candy, nothing special.
"Hmm."

The sugar in the palm of her hand still had the warmth of the other person's fingertips. Gu Peijiu tightened her grip on the sugar and casually changed the subject, "The puppet looks very well made."

Xia Ge suddenly felt like she had been caught doing something wrong. "Ah, this, this was a gift from someone else!"

Gu Peijiu made a sound of understanding. "I know."

Xia Ge felt like she had just punched cotton with her fist. 

Seeing Xia Ge looking upset, Gu Peijiu reached out and touched her hair, a hint of a smile playing at the corners of her lips. "Let's go back."

Two weeks later.

The sun was shining.

"On alchemy, one must pay attention to timing and location..."

On the stage, the bearded master stroked his beard and shook his head.

The disciples of Dan Feng sat below, all dressed in plain clothes, sitting upright. On the small table in front of them was a small incense burner, a book on alchemy, and their own notes and papers. They listened with rapt attention, creating an atmosphere of intense study in the small hall.

Xia Ge sat at the back, dressed in a clean and tidy Dan Feng robe, her book standing tall in front of her. She buried her head in her notes, her charcoal pencil moving swiftly across the paper, while a pile of messy draft papers lay beneath the book.

The master looked at the last disciple, who seemed to be there just to make up the numbers, and narrowed his eyes.

"Xia Wuyin."

"Ah...yes!" 

Xia Wuyin stood up with a "squeak", her book falling down messily. She hid her pile of draft papers under her red leather book and put on a serious expression. "Master, what do you want to know?"

The master stroked his beard and narrowed his eyes. "Can you tell me which herbs are used in the blood pill formula?"

Xia Ge thought to herself, "Wait, you didn't just talk about this, did you? Weren't you talking about how to set up the alchemy furnace?"

Seeing Xia Ge unable to answer, the master's face darkened. He rolled up his book and walked over to her, spitting as he spoke, "Xia Wuyin, you must remember that you are not like the other disciples. They need to know one thing, but you need to know ten things!"
"You are a specially recruited disciple!"

"And..."

Master was about to take this opportunity to teach a lesson to this lazy student who skipped class, but suddenly heard Xia Ge say seriously, "The three main ingredients of the Blood Replenishing Pill are Blood Refining Grass, Blood Coagulating Sand, and a flower called White Bone Flower."

Master: "..."

Xia Ge looked sincere and said, "Do you want to know about the auxiliary materials? I know those too, like Luli Sand and Coagulating..."

Master: "..."

"Okay, okay, sit down." Finally, Master glared at her and said, "Don't make any more nonsense movements!"

Xia Ge sat down obediently and nodded, "Yes, sir."

After Master finished lecturing her, he turned his gaze to Huo Bai and said, "Okay, Huo Bai, tell us about the Greedy Pleasure Drunk method?"

- Greedy Pleasure Drunk?!

Xia Ge's hand holding the book suddenly slipped, and the thick pill book "bang" fell on the incense burner on the table. The small incense burner "clang" fell off the desk, and the book fell under the table. The messy drawings she had hidden under the book were suddenly exposed to the daylight and were clearly seen by Master.

Xia Ge: "..."

Before Huo Bai could speak, he heard the goat-bearded Master's angry voice, "Xia Wuyin, get out and stand as punishment!"

Xia Ge: "Um, Master...I can explain..."

The goat-bearded Master sneered, "Explain what? Explain why you have diagrams of formations in your pill class, or why you were reading a wild history book during formation class instead of doing your homework and left it for pill class?"

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge said, "Um, sir, I also want to know how to refine the Greedy Pleasure Drunk Pill."

The goat-bearded Master didn't even look at her and snorted, "Go ahead, Huo Bai, tell us about the Greedy Pleasure Drunk method?"

Huo Bai: "..."

Huo Bai pondered for a moment, then suddenly lifted his head and recited confidently, "Madman's laughter, Drunken Linglong, and..."

He recited them one by one, sounding very confident. For some reason, Xia Ge looked at the goat-bearded Master's expression and saw that it was getting worse and worse.
Huo Bai kept talking and became more confident as he went on, "And finally, there's the herb, Si Nv Cao!"

Goatee's hand, holding the book, was tense with visible veins.

Xia Ge felt a sense of unease and subconsciously stepped back. Huo Bai still didn't realize anything was wrong and was somewhat pleased, "Master, did I answer correctly?"

Goatee seemed to have reached his limit of patience, "Get out and stand outside as punishment!"

Huo Bai was confused, "Huh?"

Seeing Huo Bai's confusion, Goatee sneered, "Do you not know why I told you to leave? Fine, what did I ask you?"

Huo Bai replied, "Tanhuan Zui."

Goatee shouted, "What did you answer?"

Huo Bai was still confused, "Tanhuan Zui."

Goatee roared, "Get out! Both of you get out! You answered Tanhuan Yin! At such a young age, your heart is already so corrupt! Who asked you for the recipe for Spring Poison? This is outrageous!"

Xia Ge thought to herself, "..."

Huo Bai thought to himself, "Damn it."

Outside the room, the autumn sun was shining brightly. Xia Ge stood outside with a water jug on her head, obediently sunbathing. Huo Bai stood next to her with a water jug on his head as well.

One was a special student with brilliant achievements in Dan Feng, the other was the top student with brilliant achievements in Dan Feng. And now they were both here, basking in the glorious light of autumn.

One was a puppeteer who was sneaky and suspicious, the other was a spy for the demonic cult with a corrupt heart. Ah, after all the brilliance, there must be some unsightly darkness.

Xia Ge was lost in thought with the water jug on her head.

"Hey."

Xia Ge was lost in thought when she suddenly heard a muffled voice next to her, "Did you make your doll yourself?"

Xia Ge instinctively lowered her head to look at her doll. The water jug on her head almost fell off, but she leaned to the side and stabilized her body. After adjusting the water jug on her head, not a drop of water spilled.

After getting used to this life-saving escape skill, it had become a natural instinct for her.
"... um, I guess."

Xia Ge glanced at Huo Bai beside her. The young man was dressed in a red maple robe, his face not as pale as when he was wielding his sword, and his cheeks had a hint of rosy color. He didn't seem as crazy as before, and was very reserved, like a silent person.

He's really an actor.

Xia Ge thought to herself. Apart from mistaking "greed for pleasure" as "greed for addiction" and revealing the method of indulging in pleasure, which was a bit foolish, but well, she also misheard it at the beginning.

Huo Bai responded with an "oh" and didn't say anything else.

Xia Ge thought, she couldn't let the conversation freeze like this, she had to find a topic.

But what to ask?

Ask: When did you steal the key?

Or ask: Who is your brother in Jianfeng, can you tell me?

Or ask: Do you have a route to the demonic sect, can you reveal it a little?

Any of the three questions would be stupid.

After careful consideration, Xia Ge decided to shut up. The more she said, the more mistakes she would make.

On the other hand, Huo Bai hesitated for a while, "Actually..."

Xia Ge asked, "Hmm?"

Huo Bai was very confused, "I seem to have seen you somewhere?"

Xia Ge's heart suddenly tightened, and when she came back to her senses, she wished she could write a hundred thousand blood books.

... Big brother, you didn't just see her "somewhere".

She could see you everywhere, except for that time when she accidentally went to the tomb of Lingxi Patriarch. Counting it out, she met you when she went out for a drink, when she took an exam, when she went to the black market to sell pills and was hunted down by you, when she came back to pick up clothes, and even when she was punished to stand in class.

Life really is full of surprises.

Xia Ge silently swallowed a mouthful of old blood, maintaining a fake smile on her face, "... Ha, it must be an illusion, I also feel like I've seen you before."

Fortunately, after upgrading her soul-stealing ability, she had the function of fuzzy memory. The previous Bai Ren, now Huo Bai, didn't remember her, otherwise the situation now would be hard to say.
"Hmm... maybe."

Huo Bai didn't say anything more.

But Xia Ge felt that he still had some doubts.

"Huo Bai, come in."

The master inside seemed to have calmed down and felt that compared to Xia Ge, who was his rebellious student in his alchemy class, Huo Bai, who could recite every ingredient of the spring poison, was more malleable. He waved his hand and let Huo Bai in, ignoring Xia Ge.

The hall door slammed shut.

Xia Ge: "..."

Okay, even though they're both not good people, you can't be so obvious in your favoritism, can you?

Xia Ge sulked and looked down at the doll hanging from her waist.

The black-haired, black-eyed doll had white skin and a faint smile on its lips.

Looking at it made her feel better.

The system spoke up: "Are you just going to let him go like that?"

Xia Ge: "...What do you mean let him go... I don't have the ability to let him go."

System: "He's a spy, you know he's a spy."

Xia Ge: "Oh, yeah."

System: "...Aren't you going to do something?"

Xia Ge: "Of course... it's such a good opportunity."

System: "What are you going to do?"

Xia Ge: "Send me twenty sanitary napkins and I'll tell you."

System: "Oh, just shut up."

The sun was getting hotter on her head. Xia Ge looked at a nearby plane tree and decided to lean against it quietly.
Although it seems meaningless, I still don't want to get tanned...

Suddenly, something was thrown at her. Xia Ge dodged and caught it in her hand. It was a chilled purple jade grape, cool to the touch and covered in frost.

"Hey, you're about to turn into a raisin. Let me hydrate you," came a voice from the tree. Xia Ge looked up and saw a leg dangling from a branch, clad in a riding boot and white trousers that hugged a slender calf. The owner of the leg kicked it lazily and said, "Can't handle a little sun, huh? Feeling lazy?"

Xia Ge: "..."

"You can be lazy if you want," said Chu Yao, her voice lazy. She sat on the branch, holding a bunch of grapes. "Do you want to come down the mountain with me and have some fun?"

Xia Ge protested, "No, I'm a good student."

Chu Yao sneered, "A good student at Danfeng? What's the point of that?"

Xia Ge decided not to continue this topic and asked, "Why are you here at Danfeng?"

Chu Yao replied matter-of-factly, "Poaching."

Xia Ge: "..."

Chu Yao laughed maliciously, revealing her shiny white teeth. "As long as you fail every exam, you can become a special student at Jianfeng soon."

Xia Ge: "..."

Hey, even if you're poaching, don't say such malicious things in front of the person you're trying to poach. Do you think saying that will make her interested? That's ridiculous! Who would want to fail every exam and become a special student? You're a moron.

Chu Yao said, "You can do whatever you want, drink or whatever. I'll treat you."

Xia Ge peeled the chilled grape and bit into it, sobbing, "Actually, there's a restaurant I've been wanting to go to!"

System: "..." You're probably lying.
"But you have to tell the master," Xia Ge said firmly, emphasizing, "You have to say that you are taking me away, not that I am willing! It has nothing to do with me, I am innocent."

The system sneered coldly, "What a pure lotus flower."

Xia Ge said, "Shut up."

Chu Yao squinted her eyes and looked at the young man below with an expression of "if you take me away, you have to take full responsibility." She clicked her tongue and said, "Fine."

After speaking, she leaped down from the paulownia tree in a graceful arc, her blue clothes fluttering lightly in the air. She landed lightly by Xia Ge's side, not dropping a single grape from the bunch in her hand. She handed the grapes to Xia Ge, then took the water bottle from his head with one hand and walked towards the hall with her clothes fluttering.

Xia Ge felt a lightness on his head and said, "Hey," coming back to his senses. He then noticed that she was carrying a sword on her back.

... disciples of Jianfeng always carried a sword with them.

But no matter how you looked at it, it seemed a bit disruptive...?

Chu Yao walked to the door, which was tightly closed. She thought for a moment, then lifted her foot.

"Hey--"

She turned around and looked at Xia Ge.

The Danfeng's Dan Fengsu clothes fit the young man well, and he looked energetic. His soft black hair was tied up with a red hairband, and a puppet doll of indeterminate origin was hanging from his waist. His black eyes looked at her expectantly, and then he made a knocking gesture.

She cautiously spoke up.

"Um, knock."

Chu Yao: "..."

"When adding ingredients..."

Chu Yao snorted, put her foot down, and instead of knocking or kicking, she pushed the door open and walked in.

The goat-bearded man was taken aback and squinted at the unexpected guest. He recognized the Jianfeng clothes and said, "Hmm?"

"Hey, old man." Chu Yao hugged her shoulders and tilted her chin towards the outside. "I'm borrowing someone from you."

The goat-bearded man's face looked a little unpleasant. "You Jianfeng people, what are you doing causing trouble in my Danfeng?"

"Causing trouble?" Chu Yao's lips curved slightly, and her eyes showed a hint of anger. She raised her chin towards the outside and said, "I'm causing trouble, but people come to Danfeng to study and I don't see you planning to teach them anything."
The goatee man immediately understood that this was the reinforcements brought in by someone. He snorted, "If a student makes a mistake, they should be punished!"

Chu Yao clicked her tongue and glanced at Huo Bai sitting beside her, squinting her eyes. "Students should be punished for their mistakes, but it depends on the punishment. People all require a clear distinction between rewards and punishments. Although people's hearts tend to favor the long, as a teacher, you can't be too biased."

She casually threw the water kettle in her hand, which was filled with water, and her light brown eyes narrowed. "Alright, enough nonsense, I'll just be wild."

She flipped her hand and threw the water kettle to the ground with a crisp sound. Water splashed around, and she laughed wildly. "I'll take the person away!"

The disciples were stunned by her words, and the teacher's face turned white with anger, trembling. "You," he started to say but couldn't finish his sentence. Chu Yao snorted and slammed the door shut with a loud bang. Then she patted Xia Ge, who was still standing outside in the scorching sun. "Alright, let's go."

Xia Ge, looking around, said, "..." No, I didn't mean that...

Xia Ge was desperate.

You might as well not say anything...

"Why are you like a block of wood?" Chu Yao looked at her sideways. "Don't you want to go drink?"

Xia Ge looked up at the geese flying south in a straight line and held the grapes, her voice drifting. "Ah, I suddenly want to roast a wild goose, the kind that's braised in red sauce..."

Okay, after this battle, she was afraid she would become famous for being reckless again.

Blue thin ah.

"A wild goose?"

Chu Yao squinted her eyes and looked up, pondering for a moment before clapping her hands. "We don't have wild geese, but can we use cranes? They have a lot of those on Sword Peak, the ones with red heads. Have you seen them?"

"If you haven't seen them, it doesn't matter." She paused for a moment. "If you want to eat them, I'll catch a few for you."

Xia Ge: "..."

Who the hell dares to eat a nationally protected animal? Will they get parasites from it?

Xia Ge: "...no, I was just joking. Let's go drink."

Chu Yao said, "Whatever makes you happy."
There is a small city located 40 miles east of the Lingxi Peak called Dongqing. The trees in Dongqing City are evergreen trees that thrive in the winter, and the people living there are prosperous and content. The restaurant that Xiaoge wants to go to is called Dongqing Restaurant. They didn't change their clothes when they came down from the mountain, and the waiter noticed that they were wearing Lingxi Peak school uniforms, so he became even more attentive. Xiaoge ordered their famous bamboo leaf liquor and some small dishes, and asked for extra alcohol. They found a window seat on the second floor, and Xiaoge had already finished her grapes on the way there, so she was in a good mood. She asked why Chuyao suddenly had time to come see her, and Chuyao replied that he was happy. Xiaoge didn't know how to respond to that. Chuyao looked out the window and commented on how Xiaoge was becoming more feminine. Xiaoge didn't know how to respond to that either. Chuyao then asked if Xiaoge would come to Jianfeng, but Xiaoge declined, saying that she couldn't handle the hardship. Chuyao was surprised and insulted, calling Xiaoge short and useless.
Xia Ge: "...why is this mouth even more poisonous than Little Puppet's?"

...forget it.

Zhu Ye Qing brought more dishes and when Xia Ge saw the alcohol, her eyes lit up slightly. She filled Chu Yao's cup and said, "I've heard that Zhu Ye Qing from his family is delicious, try it."

Chu Yao frowned and let Xia Ge fill her cup. They drank and chatted casually.

"Do you have anything that you really hate?"

After three rounds of drinking, Chu Yao was a little tipsy. She squinted her hazel eyes and looked at the sunset outside the restaurant, feeling more sober.

It was very comfortable.

Xia Ge wasn't drunk, she propped her chin up and looked outside as well, playing with peanuts. The gentle breeze brushed their faces and she felt extremely comfortable. When she heard the question, she didn't hesitate and said, "Of course, I hate not being able to eat enough, not having money, and being poor."

Chu Yao took another sip of her drink, her hazel eyes filled with drunkenness. "Is that all?"

Xia Ge nodded. "That's all, what else is there to hate?"

Or rather, besides these things, she didn't have the capital to hate anything else.

Chu Yao said, "Oh, then I envy you."

Xia Ge found it strange and a little funny. "What's there to envy about being poor?"

Chu Yao shook her head. "If you have money, you won't go hungry. Even if you don't have money, you can still earn it. Being temporarily poor doesn't mean you'll be poor forever. You can change the things you hate."

She paused and looked at Xia Ge, her voice soft and hoarse. "And you have the ability to change them."

Xia Ge looked outside the window and didn't say anything.

"You can change the things you hate and you have the ability to change them," Chu Yao said. "But the things I hate are things I can't change."

Xia Ge was slightly surprised and turned to look at her eyes.

The girl's hazel eyes reflected the sunset outside the window, warm and strange.

Xia Ge was used to seeing colored contacts in modern times, and since she had the ability to turn her own eyes purple after transmigrating, she didn't think there was anything wrong with Chu Yao's eyes at first. But now she suddenly realized that the eyes of people around her were all pure black.

Chu Yao murmured, covering her eyes with her hand, her knuckles turning white. "I can't change my identity, nor can I dig out my eyes."
"This is... the thing I envy most about you."
