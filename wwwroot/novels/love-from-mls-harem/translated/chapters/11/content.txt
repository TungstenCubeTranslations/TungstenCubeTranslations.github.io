"Quick, run!"

The teenager who grabbed her shoulder was about eighteen or nineteen years old, his voice urgent. He wore a linen robe and tied his long hair high with a blue hairband. "It's a demonic puppet! We can't defeat it. Let's retreat and wait for the people on the mountain to come down-"

Before he could finish his sentence, his wrist was suddenly grabbed.

The panicked teenager froze.

The lazy boy with a green hairband around his head stuffed a paper-wrapped pancake into his chest with his left hand, and held his wrist with his right hand. His gaze was indifferent, but inexplicably chilling.

He said, "Hey... kid."

Being called a kid by a twelve or thirteen-year-old boy should have been ridiculous, but Li Liu couldn't come up with a retort.

Xia Ge said, "There... is a child. Did you see him?"

"Wow-"

The demonic puppet wearing a black cloak and fangs mask stood in front of the crying child. A black-cloaked puppet raised a sharp black sickle high above the crying child, and in the sunset, the blade flashed with blood-red light-

Xia Ge's gaze was as sharp as a sharpened knife, and for a moment, Li Liu was speechless.

Was he questioning him? Asking why he didn't go save that child?

"I know!" Li Liu regained his senses, his face turning red. "But-"

Before he could finish his sentence, the grip on his wrist disappeared. A black shadow flashed before his eyes, and the green-haired teenager holding the pancake was gone too!

"Clang-"

The sound of clashing swords was so loud that it was almost piercing!

[Emergency warning! Unable to compete in strength! Host must evade in time!!]

[Blue warning!! Host must act within their capabilities and not be reckless-]

Li Liu suddenly turned around, taking a step forward. His pupils shrank to the size of a needle. "Hey-"

That teenager... was so fast!

He stepped on something under his foot, but Li Liu didn't have time to see what it was. In his eyes, there was only the crying child, whom the teenager held in his right hand, his back facing death, and the green-haired teenager, whom he held in his left hand, stopping the sickle aimed at the child's neck.
- Does he... have a death wish?!

A powerful shock wave transmitted from the palm of her hand, and the blade's sharp aura ruthlessly cut the edge of her palm, causing a slight pain to spread from her hand. The child in her arms seemed to have been frightened and was staring at her with wide eyes, even forgetting to cry.

Li Liu beside her even forgot to breathe.

Did that young man really catch the sharp sickle with his hand?

Of course not.

Xia Ge slightly turned her head to look at the puppet behind her. Her black pupils flashed with a cold light, and in the palm of her hand, which was in contact with the sickle, there was a piece of dragon jade.

The dragon-shaped jade pendant looked like jade but was not made of gold or jade. It was impervious to knives and guns and was not affected by fire or water.

This was her only weapon.

The air was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.

The scent of blood permeated the air.

[Host, impulsiveness is the devil.]

In her mind, there was the system's calm and somewhat indifferent voice, [You will pay the price for your impulsiveness.]

Xia Ge seemed to have not heard the system's warning. The light in her eyes softened, and she hugged the little girl's neck with her right hand as if nothing had happened. "Hey, little girl, let's make a deal. Close your eyes, and the little boy and I will play a game with you, okay?"

The child was a little girl with two buns on her head, about five or six years old.

She was held by Xia Ge in her arms, with her chin resting on Xia Ge's shoulder, looking at the tall and demonic puppet behind her. She looked like she was looking at an insurmountable mountain barrier, with an expression of extreme fear, a despair that did not belong to a child but to death. She couldn't even hear what Xia Ge was saying.

Xia Ge: "She's really scared, this child."

System: "I think you should consider yourself."

Xia Ge: "The little puppet is really smart. The little puppet is right."

System: "..."

As the sky darkened, the demonic puppet, who had not drawn blood with his first attack, became restless. He suddenly withdrew his sickle and raised it high, slashing towards Xia Ge again!

The attack was as sharp as the wind!
Xia Ge's pupils grew cold, ignoring the slight pain in her hand. She rolled on the ground with the little girl in her arms, the sickle blade grazing her ear and cutting off a few strands of hair. She stepped aside and activated her Ghost Shadow technique, transforming into several illusory figures that quickly passed by. The demonic puppet was caught off guard and its motion of swinging the sickle blade paused for a moment. Xia Ge thought she could escape unscathed, but then "bang" - she collided with another demonic puppet!

The sensation of hitting a puppet covered in iron knots was unbearable for Xia Ge's mortal body.

It was like an egg hitting a rock -

This puppet was incredibly fast, even faster than the Ghost Shadow technique by three points!

[You asked for it, this is a C-grade puppet!]

Xia Ge's eyes were filled with stars, and she couldn't hear the anxious voice of the system. In that instant when she was bounced away, she instinctively held the child tightly in her arms -

In a flash of lightning, Xia Ge looked up and met the gaze of the puppet she collided with!

The mask had a green face and bared teeth, with the eyes hollowed out and a pair of blue flames flickering inside. It stared at her, and the black sickle in its hand was raised high in an instant.

Xia Ge's pupils dilated slightly.

- She could save the child without a scratch.

- At the cost of exposing her identity.

- A mouse crossing the street, everyone shouts to kill.

- Enduring hunger and avoiding pursuit, wandering the streets.

- Drifting and homeless.

The sickle, carrying a sharp wind, was already approaching!

There was no time left -

Everything came with a price.

But in Xia Ge's dictionary, there was never the word "give up"!

She must strive for the best result once she made a decision!!!

"Hey... look here, little girl. The young man will perform a magic trick for you..."
On the sidelines, Li subconsciously closed his eyes and his legs were trembling, unable to bear the sight of the impending disaster below.

"Why are the reinforcements from Jianfeng so slow?!"

The villagers around them shouted:

"The reinforcements have come - hurry!"

"Why is there only one person..."

"It's Lord Chu!"

Reinforcements? But... it was already too late.

Xia Ge's pure black pupils turned deep purple in an instant!

Puppet secret technique - Soul Snatching!

In the blue-faced and fang-toothed puppet's eyes, the blue soul fire met the young man's deep purple eyes for a second. The scythe in its hand suddenly stopped.

"Clang!"

In the blink of an eye, the blue and white cloak swung out a beautiful arc, blocking the blue flames that were gradually turning purple in the puppet's eyes. The light blue headband fluttered in the last rays of the setting sun, giving off a color similar to blood. The black-haired girl held a long sword with one hand against the black scythe, making a clanging sound as sparks flew!

Her sword was like autumn water, her eyes like sharp waves.

In Xia Ge's eyes, there was only the blue and white short-sleeved outfit and the blue and white cloak that symbolized the identity of a swordsman.

"Hey." The girl's voice was slightly mocking. She glanced at Xia Ge, who was holding a child, and her beautiful almond eyes raised a curve that was almost provocative. She exerted a little force with her sword.

"What's the point of learning to be a hero when your strength is so rubbish?"

"Chirp!"

As soon as her words fell, the curved scythe in the puppet's hand was effortlessly cut off by the girl's long sword!

Half of the scythe flew out and was embedded directly in the head of another puppet that was trying to rush over!

A group of miscellaneous puppets.

Every move and every style flowed seamlessly. Chu Yao didn't even move her gaze.
She looked at Xia Ge, who was lost in thought, with a mocking expression in her eyes that was about to overflow.

However, just as Chu Yao was about to take down a few troublemaking puppets, she suddenly found that she couldn't take her eyes off the green-haired boy in front of her.

A moment of trance.

...What beautiful eyes.

Purple?

Upon closer inspection, isn't this the same Meng Lang boy from the other night?

...Did he have the same eyes back then?

Xia Ge snapped out of it and suddenly realized that the sword-wielding heroine who had saved him was staring at his face without moving, so he instinctively touched his face.

I didn't get any sesame on my pancake earlier...

If you don't understand, just ask.

Xia Ge looked at the heroine who had saved him and said, "...What are you looking at?"

Chu Yao looked at those captivating purple eyes and couldn't bear to look away.

At the same time, there was a sharp warning from the system!

[Orange warning! Host, close your eyes immediately! Once the captivating ability is activated, it will be forcibly maintained for a day! Anyone who sees the host's eyes will be unconsciously controlled by the host!]

Xia Ge: "What the f*ck!"

He was too handsome just now, and she forgot that she had activated her captivating ability!

Author's note:

Xia Ge: What are you looking at?

Chu Yao: Looking at you.

Xia Ge: Stop looking, I know I'm good looking. (smug)

Chu Yao pondered: Would he still be good-looking if I gouged out his eyes?
Xia Ge: "...You said it out loud, bastard."
