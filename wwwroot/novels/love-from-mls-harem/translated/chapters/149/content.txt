"..."

The text was a mix of formal and informal language, making it a bit difficult for Chu Yao to understand at first. But after reading it a few times, she could taste the joy and happiness between the lines.

Eventually, she figured out the meaning of the sentence:

"Have you ever seen peach blossoms covering the mountains and fields? They are so beautiful!"

Her suppressed emotions gradually relaxed.

Chu Yao rubbed her temples. In the latest letter, the child wrote that he had planted a peach tree by the stream and invited her to come see it when it bloomed.

Chu Yao's eyes softened. They had exchanged many letters in the past three years, and she couldn't help but notice that the child had signed his name as "Ge" instead of "Yin".

But she didn't find it strange because the first time they met in the village at the foot of the mountain, he had introduced himself as "Xia Ge".

Meeting him was like reuniting with an old friend.

Chu Yao carefully folded the letter and put it back where it belonged. Then she opened the account book on her desk.

Take it slow.

That snake that was spying on her in secret...

If only...

Chu Yao let out a sigh.

The worst-case scenario was that it was her.

The next day, Su Chan received a package of sugar-coated chestnuts.
The sweet smell of sugar filled the room as the candied chestnuts were being made in February, an unusual sight. Many people turned their heads in her direction, looking curious.

The chestnuts were placed on the table with a small note underneath. Su Chan pulled out the note, which had a delicate line of words written on it.

"Yesterday's promise to you~ - Xia Wuyin."

There was also a small tongue-out emoticon drawn at the end.

Su Chan: "......"

Su Chan glanced at the empty seat next to her, squinted her eyes slightly, then chuckled. In front of everyone, she calmly tore the small note into pieces.

Su Chan felt that she had been very calm and composed all along, at least since she woke up, and rarely felt so angry.

It wasn't really anger, though.

Su Chan thought carelessly.

It was more like feeling a little annoyed?

The melodious sound of the flute floated from the back mountain.

The guards were obediently arranged in a circle, kneeling in front of her.

System: "Aren't you going to class today?"

"No."

After finishing the song, Xia Ge put down the Eight Wilderness Flute. The faint purple light in her eyes dissipated, and the blood-colored thread inside the translucent jade flute moved like a snake, agile and lively. She stretched lazily, "There's nothing good to attend."

Perhaps it was because she hadn't seen Ye Ze for so long, or maybe the feeling of oppression when practicing puppetry had decreased a lot. In the past three years, her puppetry skills had made great progress. She would go to the black market to collect some materials and make some small puppets to practice. Finally, after Mao Qing came back, she stepped into the threshold of advanced puppetry.

The puppet level set by the system is divided into four stages: Puppet Master - Great Puppet Master - Puppet Grandmaster - Puppet God.

Each stage is divided into three sub-stages: elementary, intermediate, and advanced. Only by entering the Puppet Master stage can one truly enter the four major stages. Before that, she had been struggling as a puppet apprentice and couldn't even control a demonic puppet.

Although it was said that she had made great progress, she was still struggling in the Puppet Master stage. If she wanted to break through to the Great Puppet Master, she had to complete the tasks given by the system... The tasks were actually simple, just make an A-level puppet and it would be considered complete.
"But letting Xia Ge, a noob who can't even make a C-grade puppet, make an A-grade puppet is like a dream."

After entering the intermediate puppeteer level, there are two paths for puppeteers to upgrade: one is to continuously promote through making puppets, and the other is to upgrade by manipulating very powerful puppets.

Since the first path is very expensive and the puppets made are completely space-consuming, and with the divine artifact, the Eight Desolate Flute, in her hand, Xia Ge chose the second path without hesitation -

There are very powerful enchanted puppets available.

Xia Ge bought information from the black market and went to the wilderness swamp where A-grade enchanted puppets were said to appear. As a result, she didn't see any A-grade enchanted puppets there, but she met an S-grade enchanted hippopotamus puppet made by some big shot.

Yes, a hippopotamus.

It can breathe fire and ice, teleport, and stomp people into the swamp with one foot... an enchanted hippopotamus.

The system's forced explanation for this was: "... It was originally a normal A-grade puppet hippopotamus, but it was possessed by something powerful, so it became an awesome S-grade enchanted hippopotamus."

Xia Ge: "..."

She used all kinds of martial arts, but the hippopotamus had thick skin like iron, and was immune to her attacks. Xia Ge rolled in mud and water in the swamp, and activated the Eight Desolate Flute, which was still a heavy burden for her at that time. But fortunately, she had elixirs and the pressure brought by the Jiao Dan, and finally, after seven days and seven nights, she managed to grind this hippopotamus to... sleep.

...It didn't really die, as puppets don't die, but when their power is depleted, they automatically go into hibernation. For puppets of B-grade or higher, they will automatically replenish their spiritual energy, and they generally won't go into hibernation. But if they can't make ends meet, no matter how much they charge, they can't withstand the high energy consumption. When the poor little hippopotamus woke up relying on its automatic charging system, Xia Ge, this black-hearted little puppeteer, vividly demonstrated what it means to take advantage of someone's illness to kill them. She stepped on the hippopotamus's fragile little belly, her purple eyes with dark circles shining brightly, and successfully manipulated an S-grade sick horse in the wilderness swamp, becoming an advanced puppeteer with a fierce expression on her face.

The sun was shining brightly in the back mountains.

Bathing in the sun, Xia Ge said, "Actually, I think something's not quite right."

"What's wrong?" the system asked.

Xia Ge pondered, "It's too smooth."

The system recalled the countless times Xia Ge was stomped into the mud by the hippopotamus - those seven days and seven nights were unbearable. "Is it smooth?" the system asked.

Xia Ge: "..."

The system suddenly realized that what it just said was not quite right, "Smooth is not good?"

"...It's good," Xia Ge replied.

She didn't say it wasn't good, but...
The hippopotamus, although an S-level creature that can breathe fire, spray water, and teleport, is actually much weaker compared to an S-level humanoid puppet. To be honest, its stupidity made her doubt that it was an S-level creature at all. It was like someone had purposely beaten it into idiocy before leaving it there for her to fight. Even with all sorts of cheats, a puppeteer relies on the fragility of their puppets, and without other cheats, her level was only at D-level, even with the help of dragon blood and regular training. She wouldn't be surprised if she was pinned down and trampled by that S-level hippo in the swamp for a year or two, let alone seven days and nights. When she first saw the S-level hippo, she was planning on running away. However, its teleportation was faster than her Ghost Shadow Steps... It was a true teleportation! A turn of the head and a hoof was coming at her face... And she was really pinned down and trampled. She covered her face expressionlessly. She never wanted to see that garbage hippo again. Ever. 

Back to reality from the unbearable memory, Xia Ge couldn't help but look world-weary. "Does the black market sell fake news too?" After all, the information she received was "a high-level humanoid puppet had appeared in the wilderness swamp." The Wind and Moon Continent had a simple and crude classification of puppets, divided into the four major levels of Heaven, Earth, Mysterious, and Yellow, with each level having upper, middle, and lower tiers. The third tier of Heaven level corresponded to SSS, SS, and S, while the third tier of Earth level corresponded to A, B, and C. The higher the level, the stronger the puppet. However, what she saw was... an S-level, or rather, a Heaven-level hippopotamus... "Maybe it was just bad luck," the system thought for a moment and comforted her. "But you have to think positively. If you really encounter an A-level humanoid puppet, you won't be able to escape like you did with that stupid hippo." "No, Little Puppet, let's discuss this. I think your level setting is a big problem..." Xia Ge converted her puppetry level. "You see, my puppetry level is at the advanced puppeteer level... what level would that be?" The system's voice was calm and steady. "Yellow level high rank." Xia Ge: "..." Yellow level high rank! How could it say that with a clear conscience!!! A yellow level high rank puppeteer manipulating an Earth level high rank puppet!!!
Xia Ge smiled, "What about your conscience?"

"The upgrade condition is just manipulating an A-level puppet, even if it's just for a second, it still counts as an advancement for you," the system said cunningly, "And your overall evaluation level is at D-grade, although your puppeteer level is very low, your overall level is quite high."

"...You yourself said it's a messy overall level."

Xia Ge said, "You evaluated my overall level as D-grade, which translates to high-level Profound grade for puppetry."

The system visibly brushed it off, "Oh, D-grade, A-grade, just round it up and it's only two levels difference, it's almost the same."

Xia Ge once again recalled the suffocating feeling of being stepped into the swamp by the Heavenly level hippopotamus.

"...That was S-grade."

After arguing, the system changed the subject, or rather, returned to the main topic, "You can't keep hiding here."

Xia Ge didn't want to think about the suffocating problem of the Heavenly level horse anymore. She rubbed her temples with a headache and looked up at the sky, "Sigh."

What to do if she didn't hide?

Should she directly go to see her senior sister? Then shamelessly say, "Hey, it's super normal that I like myself, I also like myself very much, ha ha ha?"

Or pretend nothing happened?

Or should she directly tell her, "I'm not a good person, don't like me, it's not worth it."

The last one was rejection.

What would happen after rejection?

The Spirit Guardian still circled her obediently, Xia Ge leaned against the tree, hugged her legs, and rested her chin on her knees. The temperature of the Eight Wilderness Jade Flute was cold.

Senior sister... would she be upset?

She didn't dislike her senior sister, and she didn't want to see her senior sister upset, but... what kind of like was it?

She didn't know, and she didn't understand.

That warm kiss that day opened a door for her.

A door that she often saw, occasionally observed, and then smiled and casually ignored - a door.
After that kiss, she was suddenly pulled into the door. She panicked and tried to leave, but couldn't find the way out. She could only wander in the world behind the door, which seemed to be the same as outside, but her world began to twist from the moment she entered the door.

... Everything became abnormal.
