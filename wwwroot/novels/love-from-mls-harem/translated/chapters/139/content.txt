The night was deep and lonely.

Ye Ze lay in his dormitory, tossing and turning, unable to sleep.

Li Liu's words lingered in his mind like a dark hand that reached into his heart and slowly pulled out the hatred buried deep inside.

Autumn cicadas sang faintly. Ye Ze forced himself to close his eyes and not think.

But with closed eyes came obsession, and with open eyes came infatuation.

Closing his eyes, he heard his mother's soft voice and his father's stern teachings.

Then came a scene of bloody carnage.

The voice of a girl wearing silver bells rang out, "Don't even leave a dog behind."

The woman under the tree responded with a grunt.

Beside her lay the corpses of her parents in a pool of blood.

...Qin Yue.

Qin Yue!!!

Ye Ze suddenly opened his eyes, his eyes bloodshot! He got up, grabbed the sword on the wall like a madman, and pulled out the Wenqing sword with a "chi" sound. The cold moonlight shone through the window, reflecting the intricate patterns on the sword, making it even more mysterious.

Sharp as a knife, it cut through iron like mud.

Revenge...for Qin Yue!!

In an instant, a powerful and icy breath emanated from Ye Ze, as if something had awakened in him. Under the cold moon, the Wenqing sword rang out, the young man's face was sharp and angular, and his black eyes were faintly glowing with red light, like a demon from hell, cold and lifeless.

Around his waist, the Ghost Dragon Jade with a missing right horn was faintly shrouded in black mist.

Ye Ze slowly raised the Wenqing sword.

After hearing that the former leader of the demonic cult, Qin Yue, was imprisoned in the Jianfeng Mountain prison, the suppressed anger and resentment in Ye Ze's heart finally erupted at this moment!

Two hundred wronged spirits!! The two hundred people of the Ye family who died in vain!!

The grudge of the extermination of his family was irreconcilable, and the enemy was within reach. How could he...how could he lie here like garbage and do nothing?!
"He wants to chop that woman into pieces and feed her to the dogs in order to appease the two hundred grudges of his Ye family!!! He won't rest until he succeeds!!!

The ghost dragon jade at his waist suddenly emitted a bright light!! In an instant, a huge dragon formed from the condensed black mist shot out from between the ghost dragon jade, coiling up in the small bedroom. The black mist ghost dragon with its eyes closed slowly opened its reddish-golden pupils and stared at the cold-eyed boy in front of it.

It felt...a strong emotion.

This emotion was different from the last time.

It was...hatred.

Very strong, suppressed, like a feeling that had been suppressed for a long time suddenly bursting out, incredibly terrifying.

Therefore, after three years, it was once again awakened by such intense emotions.

"Child..."

The misty body of the ghost dragon wrapped around the boy, its golden pupils deep, "Do you want revenge?"

Feeling surprised by the sudden appearance of the ghost dragon, Ye Ze quickly calmed down. His black eyes reflected the cold moonlight, "Born as the heartless cold jade, died and reborn as the heartless ghost dragon."

It was the ghost dragon jade.

The ghost dragon jade itself was just a soulless stone. Later, a divine dragon descended, died from divine punishment, and its soul, which had not dissipated, was absorbed by the stone, becoming the heartless ghost dragon jade.

Because it lost its heart, it often felt that the world was boring. Most of the evil spirits and grudges were people with strong obsessions in the mortal world. Therefore, the heartless ghost dragon liked to devour evil spirits and sleep in their dreams, experiencing the coldness of the world and the various human emotions.

Over time, the ghost dragon jade became a talisman for exorcism, and no evil spirit dared to approach it.

However, if it felt a stronger obsession and emotion than an evil spirit, the ghost dragon would awaken from its dream and lend its power to that person as a way of showing gratitude for "feeling emotions".

Obviously, Ye Ze's hatred for Qin Yue awakened the ghost dragon jade from its dream.

Ye Ze paused and said again, "Yes."

He said word by word, "I want revenge."

The boy held the love sword, his eyes devoid of any emotion, "I heard that anyone who wakes you up can borrow your power."

"Yes." The ghost dragon slowly twisted its body and approached Ye Ze, suddenly saying, "I recognize you."
Ye Ze looked at him.

"I have a bad memory, sleeping all day in the jade without asking about the world, always forgetting some people, some things," said Ghost Dragon. "But I recognize you."

"Do you know why I recognize you?" 

Ye Ze shook his head.

"Three years ago... I saw you," Ghost Dragon recalled. "The last time I lent my power to someone was three years ago."

"There was a child."

Three years ago... 

Ye Ze thought of something, and his face turned pale.

"That child broke a leg. Since she awakened me, I asked her what she wanted as usual..." 

Ghost Dragon's voice was slow and gentle. "Do you know what she said?"

The question was simple.

But Ghost Dragon still remembered.

That child was alone, with one leg broken by a half-human, half-ghost monster. However, she endured the pain and did not fall down, with only her eyes shining like flames. Her true form, Ghost Dragon Jade, was taken away by a puppet, losing its protection. Countless evil spirits covered the sky and the earth, and the child's lonely soul endured the torment of the evil spirits piercing through her. Her soul was about to break, but she stubbornly refused to disperse.

Ghost Dragon didn't know how an ordinary person's soul could withstand such pain.

For thousands of years, it had always enjoyed watching the various human experiences that evil spirits went through in the world, the world's coldness, and often refining the resentment of evil spirits before entering its dream, because there were not many souls that could easily withstand the pain of being pierced by thousands of evil spirits. 

However, that child endured it.

Painful to the point where her lips almost bled, but she still stubbornly stood in place. Although she was just a child, she stood there, letting the evil spirits pass through her body, only standing there, becoming a kind of elegance.

That was the temperament and spirit that came from the soul. In that moment, the strong soul and the weak body flickered with a bright light.

At that moment, that strong emotion burst outâ€”

Cannot die, don't want to die, cannot die!!!
"No matter what you go through, you must keep living!"

It was the contradiction of being brave and fearless of death, yet also greedy for life, that mixed into a strange emotion, awakening its true self from slumber.

At first glance, it remembered this child.

Ye Ze closed his eyes and when he opened them again, they turned cold. "What did he say?"

The Ghost Dragon spoke slowly, "She said..."

-"I can lend you strength, or try my best to fulfill your wish. Tell me, what do you want right now?"

The child stood in the midst of countless ghosts, enduring the pain of being pierced by them. Its eyes glared fiercely at it, but deep in its pupils was emptiness. Perhaps the pain was too much, and its mind had become muddled. She muttered incoherently, "You're asking me what I want?! Fine, can you save the people? Can you help me save them?! They're in so much pain - why is life so painful?! Why - tell me, how can I save them?!"

...It's no wonder.

The resentment of evil spirits would amplify all the countless horrors experienced in the mortal world, and the Ghost Dragon had experienced this kind of pain.

What did the destruction of a clan matter?

The despair of a nation's downfall, the pain of being pierced by countless arrows, everything the evil spirits had experienced in life, this child would experience it all as the protagonist, over and over again.

That's why the Ghost Dragon remembered the powerful soul within the frail body at first glance.

Save the people?

It couldn't even save itself, how could it save the people?

When it saved her.

She knelt on the ground, looking dazed. "Seven hundred and seventy-seven...," she said, "...three hundred people starved to death, twenty people were dismembered, some were wrapped in horsehide, some were puppeted to death, some were pierced by countless arrows, some elderly people died alone at home with no one to care for them, some children were strangled to death by their starving mothers..."

As she spoke, she laughed, crazy and foolish. "I want to...save the people."

Laughing and laughing, she began to cry again. "I can't save the people, I can't do anything, but at least...at least, I want to bring one person out of here..."

Amidst countless despair, no one came to help.

Ye Ze remained silent.

"Saving the people may just be empty words," the Ghost Dragon floated away a bit, its golden eyes fixed on Ye Ze. "Or perhaps, it can only be empty words. She can't save the people, she can only save you from that place of countless evil spirits."
Previously, Xia Wuyin rescued him from the Demon Camp, covered in blood, using the power of the Ghost Dragon Jade.

Ye Ze tightened his grip on his sword, his face slightly pale.

The Ghost Dragon Jade sighed, "Three years ago, that child borrowed my power and used his compassion, born out of despair, to save you."

"Three years later, you awakened me with hatred."

"Do you have to do this?"

Ye Ze thought of the time when he had entered the Demon Camp alone and saw the young boy coming towards him with a broken leg, surrounded by demons.

At that time, the people in the Demon Camp were ready to kill him the next day.

Xia Wuyin was covered in blood, holding the stolen key to the shackles, and finally collapsed on him.

Demons are not merciful.

The child, who seemed to be crying in pain because of his broken leg, held his neck tightly, his voice hoarse like a demon crawling out of hell, yet gentle like a Buddha covered in holy light.

"Does it hurt?"

Ye Ze had been tortured before and said dazedly, "Yes... it hurts."

The boy with the broken leg slapped him hard on the face, his hand heavy, but Ye Ze didn't feel much pain. He heard him hoarsely say, "Who the fuck is alive and not in pain? Do you think you're the only one suffering? How can you be so naive! I'm in a lot of pain too! I'm in so much pain!!! You're nothing!"

Ye Ze was stunned.

After the bloodied little boy finished speaking, he seemed unable to stand and staggered a bit. He took a breath, held his neck, and whispered, "So, please don't be stubborn next time, okay?"

"It's hard to find you."

- Can you call me...big brother?

"...Big brother."

In an instant.

Ye Ze, who claimed that men don't easily shed tears, cried.

For the first time, he felt that he was truly foolish.
He originally thought that no one would come to save him. He originally thought...

Before breaking into the Evil Ghost Camp, Xia Wuyin revealed the hiding place of the Evil Ghost Camp to various sects, and with the clamor of people from various sects, the Evil Ghost Camp was destroyed.

After that.

After the destruction of the Evil Ghost Camp, he met the head of the Lingxi Peak, who praised Xia Wuyin's wit and bravery, gave him medicine to heal his broken leg, and the token of the Lingxi Peak, allowing him to join the Lingxi Dan Peak after he recovered from his injury.

During that time, although Xia Wuyin had medicine to heal his leg, his bones were connected, but he still couldn't sleep due to the pain of healing. Even if he slept, he was plagued by nightmares and woke up every night.

In order to let him sleep well.

Ye Ze brought wine.

"Drink it," Ye Ze said, "I heard that it won't hurt after drinking."

It was a burning throat liquor.

But Ye Ze remembered that Xia Wuyin had been plagued by nightmares for half a month, and that was the only time Xia Wuyin had not been awakened by nightmares in the middle of the night.

From that time on.

Xia Wuyin, who never drank, fell in love with drinking.

After that, maybe because he didn't want to mention his injury again, or maybe because he wanted to ease the guilt on his face, Xia Wuyin became a more smiling person.

He would call him Xiao Zes, make him do all kinds of things, make him drink with him, talk and laugh, and his cat eyes would bend into a crescent moon, as if he would never be sad.

Ye Ze never saw Xia Wuyin shed a tear.

Even if his legs were broken and he was in pain every night.

He would only say that it hurts, but he never shed a tear.

Ye Ze closed his eyes, then opened them, and gripped his sword, word by word.

"Yes, I must do this."
