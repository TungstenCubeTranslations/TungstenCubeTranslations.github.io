Chapter 214: Song of Returning Home

在这个寒冷的冬夜里，杨明独自一人踏上了回家的路程。

On this cold winter night, Yang Ming set out on the journey home alone.

他已经在外面漂泊了很久，思念故乡的家人和朋友已经让他无法忍受。

He had been wandering outside for a long time, and the longing for his family and friends in his hometown had become unbearable.

虽然他在外面经历了很多，收获了很多，但是他仍然觉得，家才是他最终的归宿。

Although he had experienced a lot and gained a lot outside, he still felt that home was his ultimate destination.

他走在路上，回忆着小时候和家人一起度过的欢乐时光，心中充满了感慨和思念。

As he walked on the road, he recalled the happy times he had spent with his family when he was a child, and his heart was filled with emotion and longing.

他想着他的母亲，她总是为他操劳，为他做好吃的，为他祈祷。

He thought of his mother, who always worked hard for him, cooked delicious food for him, and prayed for him.

他想着他的父亲，他总是默默地支持他，为他撑起一片天。

He thought of his father, who always silently supported him and held up the sky for him.

他想着他的兄弟姐妹，他们一起玩耍，一起成长，一起分享快乐和悲伤。

He thought of his brothers and sisters, who played together, grew up together, and shared happiness and sorrow together.

他想着他的朋友，他们一起打闹，一起学习，一起憧憬未来。

He thought of his friends, who played together, studied together, and looked forward to the future together.

他的心情变得沉重起来，他不由得想起了他曾经的错误和过失，他也想起了他曾经的伤痛和挫折。

His mood became heavy, and he couldn't help but think of his past mistakes and faults, as well as his past pain and setbacks.

但是，他也想起了他曾经的勇气和坚定，他也想起了他曾经的信念和追求。

But he also remembered his past courage and determination, as well as his past beliefs and pursuits.

他知道，只要他回到家，他就能够重新开始，重新面对生活的挑战。

He knew that as long as he returned home, he could start over and face the challenges of life again.

最终，他终于走到了家门口，他看到了他的母亲和父亲，他的兄弟姐妹和朋友，他们都在等待着他。

Finally, he arrived at the door of his home, and he saw his mother and father, his brothers and sisters, and his friends, all waiting for him.

他感到一阵温暖和感动，他知道，他终于回到了他的家。

He felt a warmth and emotion, and he knew that he had finally returned to his home.
