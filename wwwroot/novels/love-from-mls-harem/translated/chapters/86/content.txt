Xia Ge went bankrupt.

When she came out of Jinjiang Sugar Shop, Xia Ge felt that even today's golden sunshine revealed the poverty of not having enough to eat.

System: "Don't worry, you still have me."

Xia Ge: "Can you eat?"

System: "... No."

Xia Ge: "Shut up."

Mao Qing got some sugar and persimmon cakes and was satisfied. "Hey, Xia Wuyin, you're really good."

Xia Ge: "..."

Mao Qing held the sugar and persimmon cakes and assured her, "Don't worry! I won't tell him!"

Xia Ge covered her eyes to prevent tears of poverty from flowing out. "Thank you very much."

After walking a few steps, Mao Qing widened her eyes slightly and pointed to someone not far away. "Hey, who is that?"

"That person seems to be at the place where you used to live before. Is he here to find you?"

Xia Ge was slightly startled. Her old shabby house at the foot of the mountain seemed to have been judged as a dangerous building by Danfeng because it was too old, so there were no new disciples living in it temporarily. Thinking of this, she wanted to complain. Damn it, it wasn't a dangerous building when she lived there before. It became a dangerous building that cannot be lived in after she moved out. Does anyone have any humanitarian spirit?

She looked up and saw the person Mao Qing was pointing at. "Ye Ze?"

Mao Qing said, "Oh, you really know him? Why isn't he wearing the clothes of Lingxi Peak?"

Ye Ze on the other side also saw her and wanted to come over, but when he saw Mao Qing next to her, he stopped.

He seemed a bit at a loss.

Mao Qing picked up her things, and Xia Ge just noticed that he wasn't even wearing the clothes of Jianfeng, just a simple black outfit with his hair tied up with a black hairband, making him look a bit melancholy.

"Ah haha, he's a friend of mine. You go back first, I have something to say to him."

Mao Qing didn't say much, and just went back happily with her spoils. "You guys chat well."

After Mao Qing left, Xia Ge walked over and the corners of her lips slightly curved. "Oh, why did you think of coming to see me?"
Ye Zechen remained silent for a moment. "Who was it?" he asked.

"A friend," Xia Wuyin said with a slight surprise that he asked.

Ye Zechen didn't say anything more and turned to enter the "dangerous room".

The sound of a slightly decayed wooden door being pushed open was somewhat harsh.

Xia Ge couldn't help but say, "This is a dangerous room."

Ye Zechen glanced at her. "Someone who can sleep even while facing a sickle is now concerned about whether a room is dangerous or not."

Xia Ge argued, "It's not the same. Besides, back then, a grass hut of our own was better than a golden or silver nest of others. Other people's gold is theirs, but our own even if we have a sickle hanging over our heads, it's still ours."

Ye Zechen's eyebrow twitched. "So, what you mean is that this dangerous room isn't your grass hut anymore?"

"No, actually what I meant was that we could only live in this at the time."

"..." Ye Zechen was expressionless as he looked at her inside the dangerous room.

Xia Ge fell silent for a moment and then gave in.

The door behind them "slammed" shut. Ye Zechen wasted no time and got straight to the point. The dragon jade in his hand was missing a corner and was emitting a warm light in the gloomy room.

"I want to hear your explanation," Ye Zechen said.

Xia Ge put on a surprised look. "Huh! You actually found it? I accidentally lost it a few days ago, but I was planning to give it to you anyway, so you don't have to return it."

Ye Zechen sneered. "Xia Wuyin, why is your acting so exaggerated now?"

"..." Xia Ge was speechless.

Xia Ge silently asked the system in her mind, "Was it too exaggerated?"

The system replied, "..." A little fake.

"Lost it? Fine, lost it," Ye Zechen's voice was slightly cold. "Then who do you think stole your jade pendant and left it in that place at that time? Was it the spy from the demonic cult who attacked Chu Yao that night or was it Chu Yao herself?"
Xia Ge's eyes drifted slightly, "Ah... it might be a spy."

Ye Ze tightened the jade in his hand, seeing Xia Ge speaking vaguely, and anger surged in his heart, "What spy! Xia Wuyin, do you think I'm stupid, or do you think everyone is stupid? Who do you think you are? Do you think you can manipulate everyone?!"

"If I hadn't seen it, if I hadn't picked it up, if someone else had picked it up - do you not have a brain?!"

"Everyone will think you're a spy! You'll be caught! You have no idea what you're doing..."

"Do you not think that I'm a spy?"

Xia Ge suddenly looked up at him.

Ye Ze: "How could you be a spy?"

Xia Ge was pleased, "You're so good, Little Leaf. I didn't raise you for nothing."

Ye Ze: "Get lost."

Xia Ge sighed and coaxed him, "The jade was originally yours. If you picked it up, it means you have a connection with it. What does it matter where and when you picked it up? Even if you found it in a dung heap, who knows its origins after you've cleaned it? Fate brings people together. Benefactor, please accept it."

Veins popped on Ye Ze's forehead, "..."

Xia Ge hurriedly said, "Oh, by the way, don't worry, I didn't pick up this jade from a dung heap."

The system choked, "Your analogy is so appropriate."

"I don't care where you picked it up from!" Ye Ze said, suddenly feeling exhausted, "Can't you just..."

- I don't care where you picked it up from.

Xia Ge fell silent for a moment at his words.

For some reason, she suddenly felt sad.

Ye Ze didn't understand, but the system knew that when Xia Ge was just ten years old, what did she go through to get the Ghost Dragon Jade? She didn't have Ye Ze's luck, nor was she a child of destiny. To snatch something from a child of destiny, it was naturally not an easy road.

But she had no other choice at the time.

Ye Ze took a deep breath and decided to end the topic, asking, "How did you get into Senior Sister's room at the time?"

Xia Ge snapped out of her thoughts and sighed, "Ah, it's all because I'm too beautiful, it's all my fault."
System couldn't hold back: "Speak in human language."

Ye Ze: "Speak in human language."

Xia Ge: "...I'm going to help my senior sister with the case files."

Ye Ze looked at her for a while, "I understand."

He walked past Xia Ge, pushed open the door behind her, "Xia Wuyin."

"No matter what you say now, I will believe you."

"I believe everything."

After speaking, he left.

Without looking back.

Xia Ge turned around and looked at his back. After a while, she took out a piece of cherry blossom candy from her pocket, slowly peeled it open, and then threw it into her mouth.

System: "...You actually hid a piece?!"

Xia Ge chewed on the candy, "Shut up."

After a long time.

As the sweet taste melted away with the candy, there was no trace of sweetness left.

When there was no sweetness left, a slightly bitter taste slowly crept up.

"Xiao Gui, I'm still a little sad."

System: "What are you sad about?"

Xia Ge: "Sigh."

If Ye Ze really believed her.

He wouldn't have asked her why she was in Senior Sister's room at that time.

"...So sometimes it's like this." Xia Ge pushed open the half-rotten door, felt the bright sunlight outside, and squinted her eyes. "Although I've lied countless times, I always think it would be nice if someone believed everything I said."
"You can rest assured." The system said, "There's no such idiot."

Xia Ge replied, "…Just think about it."

The system thought for a moment, "I'm afraid that you'll be too smart for your own good and won't be able to please anyone."

"That's my problem," Xia Ge said.

"But what if you regret it later?" The system asked.

"Later?" Xia Ge smiled, "Who knows what will happen in the future."

Besides, in the future…

She was a puppeteer.

She never thought that she could hide her identity forever.

If no one found out, and she couldn't go home, it wouldn't be a bad thing to spend the rest of her life in Danfeng. But since she had decided to search for the town soul and move towards the great puppeteer, she had to be prepared to be discovered.

When the time comes and the truth is revealed, it's almost predictable what will happen.

"It's nice to live freely by oneself for a lifetime." Xia Ge said to herself, "At least for now, it's good."

No one will be involved.

She is alone.

She will always be alone.

So, perhaps, no matter what.

She won't regret it.

"I'm leaving, going back to class."

= =

It's raining.

The mountain rain started to patter, but no one paid attention.
Then it slowly grew bigger.

Recently, they started their alchemy practice class. The smoke from the furnace was misty, and the teacher's task was simple: make three Revitalization Pills. Whoever finished first could leave. Xia Ge was very fast at making pills. While others were still figuring out the amount of herbs to use, she had already thrown everything she needed into the furnace. Revitalization Pills were simple and she had also opened her spiritual aperture, so she was very meticulous in controlling the fire spirit energy in the air. Therefore, making pills was as fast as using cheats.

After giving the pills to the teacher, Xia Ge could leave. The teacher who taught the pill formula looked at the pills she made. Even though he didn't have a good impression of Xia Ge, he couldn't help but show some appreciation, "Not bad, not bad."

However, outside, the rain continued to pour down. The raindrops, as big as beans, fell from the misty and gloomy sky and formed long rain threads. They pattered on the red tiles and paper windows, and some fell into puddles, splashing water like crowns.

Xia Ge squatted at the door for a while. She didn't bring an umbrella.

System: "...Why are you squatting here?"

Xia Ge: "I didn't bring an umbrella."

System: "Is there a direct connection between not bringing an umbrella and squatting here?"

"In the TV dramas I watched before, the female lead would squat here and someone would bring an umbrella to her after a while." Xia Ge thought for a moment. "Then I would have an umbrella."

The system was speechless for a moment, then said, "You need to wake up."

Xia Ge: "I am very awake."

System: "Stand up."

Xia Ge: "I won't."

System: "You are still not awake."

Xia Ge: "..."

System: "Think about it, in the TV dramas, the female lead usually squats here after a heartbreak, feeling sad and upset. Moreover, they are squatting in the rain, which is why someone would bring them an umbrella. But you are not heartbroken, not sad or upset, and you are also squatting under the eaves..."

The system sounded a bit distressed, "If you want to act, you have to do it properly."

Xia Ge nodded, "Yes, you are right."

After speaking, she deftly stepped out of the eaves, passed through the pouring rain, and squatted next to a puddle.
Next to a puddle, a frog croaked "ribbit".

Xia Ge moved her feet to give it some space.

System: "..."

The heavy rain fell relentlessly, soaking the young girl through. Her soft black hair clung to her shoulders, and her longing heart yearned to weave a cloth to shield her from the rain.

"Xiangsi."

Xiangsi paused, her red hair drooping.

She was completely drenched.

Her clothes stuck to her body, making her feel both cold and uncomfortable.

The system felt suffocated: "Have you been drinking water instead of using your brain lately?"

Xia Ge: "..."

System: "Listen to the sound of the water. Do you want to shake your head to listen? Never mind, I'll tell you. It's rushing and gurgling, full of water."

The system wanted to say more, but Xia Ge suddenly said, "I feel uncomfortable."

System: "..."

The sound of the pouring rain drowned out the young girl's faint voice, which sounded like she was talking to herself.

It seemed like no one could hear her.

The system paused: "What's making you uncomfortable?"

Xia Ge: "No one is here to give me an umbrella, and it's making me uncomfortable."

System: "...I think you not only have water in your brain, but also a pit."

Just as Xia Ge was about to say something else, the cool rain hitting her suddenly disappeared.

A light scent of sandalwood mixed with the faint smell of vegetation in the rain slowly spread out.
Summer slowly lifted her head.

The girl in the red maple dress had a slightly furrowed brow, and half of the white oil-paper umbrella painted with landscapes was held over her head, while the other half leaned towards her, blocking the sharp rain like a knife. But her shoulder was already soaked by the pouring rain.

She looked like a fairy who didn't belong to this world, willing to endure the wind and rain for someone and come down to the mortal world.

Summer was a little dazed.

After a while, she smiled and looked at her, "Senior sister, you're so kind."

Gu Peiju looked at the girl squatting on the ground like a mushroom, her whole body soaked by the rain, her wet hair sticking to her white cheeks, her black cat eyes wide open and watery, perhaps because the rain had flowed into her eyes, her eye sockets were slightly red.

Although she smiled, her eyes seemed to be crying.

Gu Peiju thought.

Raindrops hit the umbrella, and Gu Peiju reached out to her, "Get up."

Her white hand was as clean as snow, and her voice was clear and gentle in the rain.

Summer shrank her hand and lowered her head, "I don't want to move."

What a white hand.

The system: "..."

Gu Peiju's outstretched hand paused for a moment, then withdrew, but she didn't leave, just silently held the umbrella.

The sky was cloudy, and the rain was pouring down. The girl in the red maple dress was already completely soaked on one side, but the girl under the umbrella hadn't been touched by a single drop of water. A rain frog next to them croaked twice, then jumped into a puddle, splashing mud onto Summer's skirt, as if mocking her lack of self-esteem.

Summer lowered her head, "Are you here to see Master?"

Gu Peiju nodded.

"Then go quickly." Summer paused, "I'll be fine squatting here for a while."

Gu Peiju was silent for a moment, "Why are you squatting here?"
"I'm sad, I want to crouch down," Xia Ge said. "Maybe if I get rained on a bit and clear my head, I won't be sad anymore."

"Why are you sad?" Gu Peijiu asked.

"Do you want to know?" Xia Ge replied.

Gu Peijiu made a sound of agreement.

"Then I'll tell you," Xia Ge said. "I was sad before because no one held an umbrella for me."

Gu Peijiu looked at her.

"Now I'm sad because someone held an umbrella for me, but it got you wet," Xia Ge continued. "You're so kind. I feel a bit reluctant."
