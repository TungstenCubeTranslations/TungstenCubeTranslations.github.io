"Have you heard? The Sky Brilliance of the Chang family has been stolen..."

"Who did you hear that from? It can't be true, without the Sky Brilliance, the demon tide..."

"..."

The warm sunshine made people feel a bit lazy.

It was on such a lazy day that the Chang family, led by the call of the Martial Heroes Order, broke into the mountains.

Xia Ge was sitting on a rocking chair, reading a book and swaying back and forth, feeling a bit uneasy. Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the courtyard, with shouts and screams constantly ringing in her ears.

"..."

She lifted her head from the rocking chair, still a bit confused. "Why is it so noisy outside?"

Gu Peijiu, who was behind her, reached out and touched her head. "Stay put."

Xia Ge suddenly came to her senses and asked, "Is it the Demon Cult coming?"

As someone who had escaped from the Demon Cult, her first reaction was that Su Chan had found her. After all, Ye Ze had come before, and maybe Ye Ze was just a decoy, and Su Chan had brought people over...

"It's the Chang family's people," Gu Peijiu said, "from the Martial Heroes Order."

Xia Ge was relieved that it wasn't the Demon Cult, but was still amazed. "They found me so quickly?"

Gu Peijiu nodded, thinking of the demonic energy she had felt a few days ago and realizing something.

That was the breath of disaster.

The Chang family's people came right after sensing the breath of disaster... There must be some connection between the Chang family and the disaster.

Gu Peijiu narrowed her eyes slightly.

Soon, the courtyard door was knocked, and then kicked open!

"Is anyone here?!"

Two muscular men in purple clothes opened the door. They were very powerful, obviously experts in internal martial arts.

Chang Ren and his men followed in.
The courtyard was neither big nor small. Several persimmon trees and other plants were planted in the west of the courtyard. A row of embroidery ball trees had yet to bloom and were clean and tidy. Only a young woman in white sat quietly under a plane tree. The ancient rocking chair swayed gently, and her black hair hung on her fair neck. She flipped through a book, and the snow-white wide sleeves slipped down slightly, revealing the emerald green ribbon with a butterfly knot on her white wrist.

Even if someone rushed in, she remained calm and unperturbed.

Xia Ge hid behind Gu Peiju, and her whole person was hidden by Gu Peiju's barrier. Therefore, people could only see Gu Peiju but not Xia Ge.

Gu Peiju raised her eyes and spoke calmly, "I apologize for not welcoming the distinguished guest who came today."

Someone impatiently stepped forward and said, "Cut to the chase, where did you hide that witch?"

Gu Peiju didn't even lift her eyes.

The next moment, a strong gust of wind swept by, and the person who spoke widened his eyes as he was lifted off the ground by the violent gust of wind. He spun horizontally like a top and fell heavily on the huge plane tree outside the courtyard, with the sound of branches breaking and his screams ringing in everyone's ears.

For a moment, everyone was horrified, and their eyes on Gu Peiju carried three parts of vigilance and probing.

Gu Peiju turned a page of her book and said lightly, "Bring someone who can speak human language."

Everyone: "..."

Chang Ren stepped forward and said, "Miss Gu, there's no need to be angry. We all came here for the whereabouts of that... "

Thinking of the fate of the previous person, although he was a master of Tianji, he was not afraid of Gu Peiju. He had to give face to Gu Peiju, who carried the ancient charm, so he paused and said, "The whereabouts of the witch cult's little priest."

But Gu Peiju murmured to herself, "Is it pleasing to the ear?"

Xia Ge, who had been hiding behind, was stunned and asked, "Huh?"

Then she thought, "Not pleasing to the ear! 'Little witch' and 'witch cult's little priest' don't sound good! All those with magic are not good! We want Lei Feng! We want little fairies!"

Everyone looked at Gu Peiju talking to herself, and they looked at each other in confusion.

Chang Ren couldn't help but step forward again, "Miss Gu..."

But he was met with the sharp Red Thorn coming towards him!

Chang Ren's eyes widened, and he unsheathed his long sword. He slashed fiercely, but Red Thorn was not to be underestimated. Electric light flickered, and she broke the sword arc with one move, forcing Chang Ren to take a step back!

Chang Ren widened his eyes suddenly. With his level of cultivation, even if Tianzhu Ling was an ancient charm, her ability to force him back with just one move was enough to illustrate her strength!

"It's said that disciples of the Lingxi Peak can block ten thousand moves with one strike. It's truly well-deserved." Chang Ren sheathed his sword casually and took another step back. Just as he finished speaking, he heard a voice say, "Rebel!"
The voice was old but powerful, fully displaying the level of a Heavenly-ranked expert.

An old lady with white hair stepped forward, holding a feather duster in her hand. "You disappeared suddenly, and everyone in Lingxi has been searching for you. It turns out you were colluding with that traitor!"

She was the head of Lingxi Peak.

Xia Ge, who had been squatting behind and shouting "666" continuously, couldn't say anything this time. She looked at Gu Peijiu uneasily, wanting to say something, but in the end, she said nothing.

Gu Peijiu raised her eyes calmly, seemingly expecting this. She said calmly, "She is not a traitor."

The head was furious. "It's already this late, and you're still speaking up for that traitor!"

Gu Peijiu put down her book and finally got up from her rocking chair. The white cuffs of her sleeves fluttered in the breeze. Her gaze was cold, but her voice was still calm. "I said she is not a traitor."

The head covered her chest and took a deep breath. "You... are you trying to kill me with anger? Don't forget the oath you made when you joined the sect. What are you now? You're such a disappointment!"

Oath?

Xia Ge looked at the head uneasily, then at Gu Peijiu.

Gu Peijiu said nothing. The Heavenly Punishment Ribbon was wrapped around her side, and the blood-red ribbon and the white clothes fluttered in the breeze. She seemed indifferent.

Someone beside them echoed, "You're shielding that little witch. Have you fallen into the demonic path?"

As soon as the words fell, the person was also lifted up and thrown out like the previous one, rolling outside the courtyard, completely disfigured.

"Why are you talking so much nonsense? We have so many people here. Let's go and catch her and torture her until she confesses everything!"

Another man with a ferocious face stepped forward, holding two wolf-tooth hammers in his hands. "Master Yan, let me go and take her down!"

The head of Lingxi Peak was surnamed Yan.

She waved her hand to stop the man's movements, stepped forward, and persuaded, "We all know that you were bewitched by that little priestess and accidentally fell into the demonic path. As long as you hand over that little witch, everything that happened before will not count."

Seeing that Gu Peijiu was not speaking, the head of Lingxi Peak asked again, "Don't you have anything to say?"

Facing the head, Gu Peijiu sighed lightly, shook her head, and said, "I have nothing to say."

"Don't say anything! She has already been bewitched by that little witch. Let me go and take her down!"

The man waved his wolf-tooth hammers and rushed towards Gu Peijiu!
Gu Peijiu looked at the head of Lingxi, her eyes unmoving. The red vines around her body trembled, and in an instant, they shook like waves, one wave higher than the other, as if throwing a stone into a calm lake and creating ripples, but each ripple carried a terrifying spiritual power.

The man couldn't even get close to Gu Peijiu within fifty meters before he was violently thrown back by the waves. Even the edges of the red silk didn't touch him. Amidst the flashing lightning, his body convulsed and a burnt smell filled the air.

Gu Peijiu raised her eyes and spoke calmly, "Is there anything else?"

"Or, are you all going to attack me together?" 

Xia Ge was shocked. Although she often acted recklessly in Danfeng, she could still recognize people who had real abilities. If they all attacked together... what about her senior sister?

She couldn't help but grit her teeth. Constant Blade had gathered so many people to hunt her down, leaving her no way out!

Shameless, truly shameless!

The crowd was in an uproar.

"...It seems that she has lost her mind and won't turn back!"

"Amitabha, this benefactor is really..."

"..."

"Don't waste time! Let's attack together!"

Constant Blade intervened, "No, no. You are all heroes. How can we bully someone weaker? "

Someone in the back shouted, "Then let the head of the Constant family go up! Doesn't he have the Radiance of the Sky? Gu Peijiu's Tianzhu Ling is powerful. If we don't attack together, only someone with the same ancient clothes and charm as the Radiance of the Sky can fight her!"

Xia Ge saw Constant Blade speechless.

She sneered, he had no ability to fight her senior sister even if he pretended to be a hero with a swollen face.

But Constant Blade was indeed a sly old fox. He looked at the head of Lingxi, sighed lightly, and covered up his discomfort, "After all, Miss Gu's matter is Lingxi Peak's internal affair...no matter how powerful we are, it's really not appropriate to interfere..."

Xia Ge was suffocating, "How shameless can he be?"

The system also commented, "He is truly shameless."

The head of Lingxi stepped forward again, and Gu Peijiu looked at her with a calm expression, but the Tianzhu Ling was still unfurled.
"I remember you once made a vow," said Master Yan sternly. "As long as you uphold the righteousness of this world every day, you will not hesitate in the slightest."

"But what about now?" Gu Peijiu looked uneasy.

"It is as it is," she replied.

Master Yan's voice and expression grew severe. "Then what about this? You woke up and didn't see me, that's one thing. But you have always been someone who keeps their word, why are you so stubborn now?!"

"Stop it!" someone behind them said. "It's no use talking! Let's just go and fight!"

Seeing that Gu Peijiu was unmoved, Master Yan finally sighed and said, "Master Chang, I won't hold back anymore...you don't need to worry about me, just take down this traitor. We'll sort things out later!"

In other words, even if it's a group of people fighting one person, this disciple should take them down for me, without worrying about face.

As soon as he said this, some impatient people rushed forward. "We've been wanting to learn from the Ancient Clothes Demon for a long time!"

All those who came were experts from various sects, which showed that the person who issued the call to heroes did indeed have some face.

The monk sighed lightly and said "Amitabha" before his golden staff trembled slightly in his hand. Countless sharp light rain fell from the sky, and the raindrops pierced through leaves and flowers like needles without hesitation. However, when they fell on the Thunderbolt Silk, they seemed somewhat powerless. Someone else was skilled in controlling beasts, and a red, double-headed fierce beast that Xia Ge had never seen before rushed towards the Thunderbolt Silk in the midst of the light rain. The monk's powerful light rain fell on its fur but didn't harm it in the slightest. When it opened its mouth, a fierce flame burst forth from its sharp fangs!

...

Xia Ge was dazzled by the spectacle. Under the relentless attacks of everyone, the Thunderbolt Silk finally showed some slight signs of wavering.

Chang Ren looked a little pale. "This isn't right, why..."

Master Yan's expression also didn't look good.

Gu Peijiu was very strong.

...It should be said, too strong.

The attacking people were not only of high status, but even the lowest among them were at the level of Earth Rank experts. Although their attacks seemed low-key, each strike was a real Earth Rank or higher attack. Even the Ancient Clothes Demon would have a hard time holding on for so long without a powerful backing!

Chang Ren couldn't help but ask, "Master Yan, has Miss Gu always been like this..."

As he asked, his eyes unconsciously swept towards Gu Peijiu's back.

Just now, the disaster-telling person told him that Qin Shuang was hiding behind Gu Peijiu and was concealed by her barrier.

Master Yan looked at the white-clad girl who remained unscathed amidst the chaos and explosions. His old voice trembled slightly, but he couldn't find the words to say.
"Very strong.

Too strong.

It was as if she had already broken free from the shackles of humanity.

The young girl stood in the middle, with vermilion lips and a pale face, her black hair fluttering. Her eyes reflected the myriad of colors attacking like fireworks, finally turning into indifference and chaos deep in her pupils.

"Why can't we break through-"

"We won't be able to..."

Everyone started to get anxious.

No one noticed that at some point, the entire courtyard had been enveloped in a barrier.

Xia Ge stood behind Gu Peiju, pulling at her clothes and whispering, "Sister, you're so amazing."

Gu Peiju didn't say anything, but her lips curled up slightly.

After Xia Ge finished speaking, she thought of what Lingxi Sect's leader had said, and for some reason, she felt down.

When Sister entered the sect... she must have made a vow, just like when she was a Young Pioneer and said, "I will always be loyal to Balabala."

When she entered Lingxi Peak as an unimportant outer disciple, no one forced her to make a vow to protect the righteous path of humanity for the rest of her life... Even if she had made a vow, she might not have followed it.

But Sister was different from her.

After a long time of attacking with no success, a powerful Taoist priest who was throwing fireballs and shouting frantically said, "Miss Gu, we have no intention of being your enemy. Why do you insist on hiding a demoness of the demonic sect and being an enemy of the righteous path of humanity?!"

Upon hearing this, Gu Peiju remained silent, and with a shake of her Red Lotus, the world changed in an instant!

...Being an enemy of the righteous path of humanity?

"Boom-"

- I vow, I will protect this righteous path of humanity from evil, and not be tainted by impurities until death.

"I have never broken my vow."

The brilliant white light that shook out of the rolling Red Lotus plunged the world into chaos in an instant, and countless screams and roars were instantly annihilated. Only the faint voice of the young girl, calm and safe, transcended the world.
"She is my righteous path in this world."

- This is the vow I have never broken from beginning to end.
