System: "..." Kick over this bowl of dog food!

As they kissed, Xia Ge suddenly realized something and looked horrified: "Did I chop off someone's finger before the disaster was driven away?!"

The system remained silent, secretly cursing.

It was not just fingers that were chopped off. If Gu Peijiu hadn't stopped the Chu family, it might have turned into a slaughterhouse by now, selling human flesh for one or two yuan per kilogram.

Gu Peijiu blushed slightly and her eyes shimmered with waves. She pressed Xia Ge onto the bed and almost stripped her naked, but her voice remained calm like an outsider: "Don't worry, the disaster has been driven away now."

She deliberately ignored the fact that Xia Ge had been possessed by the disaster before.

Xia Ge licked her lips and mischievously pulled Gu Peijiu's belt: "Those things you said before were all said by Ye Ze, right?"

Gu Peijiu stared at her with shimmering eyes and calmly replied, "Yes."

Xia Ge liked her serious look now.

The system couldn't stand their affection and maliciously said, "A beauty trap!"

But Xia Ge didn't care about the beauty trap. She murmured, "With such a beautiful face, she could rob me while I'm in trouble."

After speaking, she rolled over and pinned Gu Peijiu to the bed.

Now all she could think about was her senior sister's beautiful face, and she even emptied her brain to undo her belt, without considering the small language trap set by the other side.

The system was heartbroken: "Don't you have any thoughts of capturing the enemy?"

Who had time to think about the thirty-six strategies when faced with such beauty? Xia Ge automatically blocked the system's background music, decisively pulled the belt, and the soft belt fell apart, presenting an enchanting scene before her eyes...

Disheveled clothes.

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge was heartbroken: "Senior sister!"

Gu Peijiu looked at her, holding her hand and smiling mysteriously.
She had no more tricks up her sleeve, but her senior sister was different. After using the beauty trap, she came up with another devious plan out of thin air! She even wanted to use her wiles to get her to undress her!

This was a series of tricks!

The system coldly said, "Can you use your brain a little?"

Xia Ge: "......"

Xia Ge put her hand down and was about to squat in the corner of the bed head wall.

The system: "......"

"Isn't it too quick for you to give up halfway?"

Xia Ge languidly replied, "Giving up halfway is not one of the thirty-six strategies."

Feeling a slight warmth, Xia Ge felt someone embrace her from behind. Gu Peiju asked, "What's wrong?"

Her voice was soft and serious.

Xia Ge: "......"

Even if she had the thickest skin, she couldn't say that she wasn't wearing revealing clothing today.

She glanced at the beautiful slender hand that was unintentionally placed on her chest, restrained herself from touching it, and resisted the urge to say something vulgar like, "My senior sister saw me wearing revealing clothing." She hesitated for a moment before asking nonchalantly, "What else did Ye Ze say?"

Gu Peiju said, "I won't tell you."

Xia Ge looked at the soft gauze bed curtains and said, "Let me tell you about this girl I saw the other day. She was so cool......"

Without a word, Gu Peiju covered her mouth with one hand and unhesitatingly undid her clothing belt. Her calm and collected voice finally gained a hint of hoarseness, "Oh? Is that so?"

The system: "......" This diversion tactic was clever.

Tian Zhuling automatically hid under the bed, and her snow-white revealing clothing softly fell down. Gu Peiju's pale wrist was exposed, and a green ribbon with a missing corner was tied into a lovesick knot on her wrist.

Xia Ge recognized what it was.

The green hair tie was missing a corner and was tied into a lovesick knot on her pale wrist.

Her eyes became slightly moist.
The person behind her kissed her earlobe gently and tenderly.

Gu Peiju stopped and whispered, "Why are you crying?"

Xia Ge said, "I... senior sister, I feel... I..."

She turned around and hugged Gu Peiju tightly, biting her shoulder, "Don't leave me..."

Gu Peiju kissed her eye corner and said, "Hmm."

"You swear."

"Hmm, I won't leave you."

"For a lifetime."

Gu Peiju shook her head, "Not for a lifetime."

Seeing the tears in Xia Ge's eyes about to fall like tap water.

Gu Peiju bowed her head and whispered in her ear.

"Forever and ever."

"If you leave, I'll wait for you. If you come, I'll be with you."

Last life, this life, next life.

I have to meet you to be complete.

Xia Ge closed her eyes, let go of her fangs, and kissed her lips.

Sending my love to the bright moon, without saying goodbye or return.

The end.

Not really.

= =

After being possessed by a demon, Xia Ge lost all consciousness and wouldn't know what she had done. Perhaps it would appear in her dreams, but the images in her mind would be shallow.
Those shallow impressions remain in the subconscious, without careful consideration, they won't be remembered at all.

Just like the existence of calamity.

Watching Xia Ge, who was exhausted and sleeping soundly in bed, Gu Peijiu touched her forehead with relief, covered her with a blanket, and went to take a shower.

Gu Peijiu had only been gone for a few minutes.

Exhausted Xia Ge secretly opened one eye.

Xia Ge, even if she was bad, still had the strength of a land-level cultivator. How could she be defeated so quickly in bed? It was too embarrassing.

"Ah..." She sat up, feeling sore all over.

Xia Ge hesitated for three seconds, then lay back down and took out a pill, throwing it into her mouth.

System: "..."

The sound of the shower stopped.

Xia Ge immediately closed her eyes, and a tear of pain rolled down her cheek uncontrollably.

The sound of water continued. After the pill took effect, Xia Ge immediately opened her eyes and stared blankly.

Sex was really tiring.

Although it was really enjoyable, there had to be a limit, right? She pretended to faint for the sake of her senior sister's body. If she was fine but her senior sister was exhausted, wouldn't that be a sin? What was that saying again? "To flee is the best strategy"?

The system mocked her, "Stop insulting the 'Thirty-Six Stratagems'. What you did was shameless and cowardly."

Xia Ge thickened her skin, "I did it for everyone's sake..."

System: "..."

Xia Ge pretended to be dead in bed for a while.

After a while, she felt rested. The shower was still not finished.

Xia Ge wondered, did it really take that long to shower? Her senior sister was really delicate.

Wearing her senior sister's revealing clothes, she tiptoed barefoot to the door and whispered in her heart to the Xia Ge waiting outside, "Senior sister, please be even more delicate!"

Â 
She quietly pushed open a crack in the door, the little person in her heart rubbing their hands in excitement. Senior sister! Keep washing a little longer!

A beauty after bathing, oh!

The system went crazy: "Is this how you're supposed to use your lightness skill?!!"

As Xia Ge was still giggling and hadn't finished yet, she noticed a pair of quiet, pitch-black eyes through the crack in the door.

Xia Ge: "......"

Gu Peijiu, who had just put on her bathrobe, was squatting on the ground with wooden clogs, her snow-white bathrobe revealing her half-exposed chest. Her eyes were misty and dreamy as she quietly watched Xia Ge through the gap.

Xia Ge stared at the other person's chest that was about to burst out: "......"

It's said that looking at people through a crack in the door makes them look flat, but Senior Sister's chest doesn't look flat no matter how you look at it. It's round and smooth, and even feels elastic...

Can't think about it anymore!! Will die in bed!

Gu Peijiu looked at Xia Ge's nervous eyes through the crack in the door, and her lips curled up slightly, as if she had learned how to read minds: "Do you want me to take it off for you to see?"

Xia Ge quickly slammed the door shut with a loud bang, and ran barefoot to the bed, pretending to be dead.

Gu Peijiu casually came out and walked to the bed, doing nothing but staring at her.

After a while, Xia Ge, who was uncomfortable being stared at, pretended to be just waking up and asked Gu Peijiu, who was still staring at her: "Did I sleepwalk just now, Senior Sister?"

Gu Peijiu smiled meaningfully: "Yes, you did. You look pretty energetic."

Xia Ge: "......"

= =

Xia Ge was bored being stared at by Senior Sister, so she went out to look around. They were in a mountain courtyard with a small bridge and flowing water. Climbing up the wall, they could see the dense forest on the neighboring mountain. According to Senior Sister, this was a base of the black market, built here because there was a vein of high-quality spirit stones on the neighboring mountain.

"How did Senior Sister get involved with the black market?" Xia Ge squatted on the wall and admired the scenery for a while before realizing it.

System: "Because she's your senior sister."

Xia Ge: "......"

Alright then.
Xia Ge was feeling a bit melancholic. It wasn't good to keep going like this. Chu Yao was about to get married and she couldn't just sit around doing nothing. But she also didn't dare to tell her senior sister...

It was a bit like feeling worried about rescuing the other woman and getting caught by the main wife.

The system commented coolly, "I knew there was something wrong with your thinking."

Xia Ge replied, "I'm a proper young person with good morals. How could there be something wrong with my thinking?"

Apart from occasionally glancing at her senior sister's face and chest... which was just human nature, there really was nothing wrong with her thinking!

The system mocked her, "If there's nothing wrong with your thinking, then why don't you just tell her? You're so hesitant, it's like you're having an affair."

Xia Ge remained silent.

Just as she was thinking this, she saw Gu Peiju enter the courtyard from the kitchen, her clothes snowy white.

It was just like the countless times she had seen her come out of her room at Danfeng, with her black hair and red maple leaves fluttering in the wind, or her wooden clogs and delicate feet, her clothes soft and flowing.

Every time, she would secretly peek at her from behind the crooked-necked tree behind her own little house, feeling that her senior sister's appearance was indescribably beautiful.

Back then, she was young and ignorant and didn't understand the meaning behind her feelings. But now, looking back, those scenes were all imprinted in her memory, unforgettable, like the colors of spring in autumn.

Suddenly, she remembered that although it had only been a few days, she hadn't seen her senior sister wearing the red maple leaf dress.

Just as she was thinking this, Gu Peiju had already walked to the corner of the wall and was looking at Xia Ge, who was crouched on the wall. The gentle sunlight made her squint her eyes as she said, "Come down."

Xia Ge acted like a spoiled child and said, "I won't come down unless you answer a question for me."

"Hmm?"

"Why aren't you wearing the red maple leaf dress anymore, senior sister?" Xia Ge asked.

Gu Peiju remained silent for a moment.

After a while, she looked up and said, "Come down."

Xia Ge blinked and said, "If you don't tell me, I won't come down."
Gu Peijiu said, "I don't feel like wearing it."

Xia Ge said, "Just do it to appease me."

Gu Peijiu replied, "..."

Xia Ge asked, "Is Senior Sister planning to never wear clothes again?"

Gu Peijiu, not sure if Xia Ge was joking, absentmindedly replied with an "Mm."

Xia Ge covered her eyes in shock, "Senior Sister, how can you not wear clothes?! You're being a pervert!"

Gu Peijiu, who was properly dressed, remained silent.

After a while, seeing that Gu Peijiu didn't react, Xia Ge took her hand down and sat on the wall in a different position, saying boredly, "I still prefer Senior Sister wearing the Dan Feng plain clothes."

Gu Peijiu looked at her and said, "There's no need for that."

Xia Ge rested her chin on her hand and said, "Senior Sister doesn't have to do this."

Gu Peijiu paused and then said, "If you like it, I can wear it for you."

Gu Peijiu reached out to her.

The snow-white sleeve floated down, revealing the tender green hair tie on her white wrist. The beautiful lovesick knot was incredibly soft in the sunlight.

Xia Ge leaped down, the warm sunlight pouring down, her dress fluttering as she threw herself into Gu Peijiu's arms like a swallow.

Her voice was muffled, "If Senior Sister does this...I won't know what to do."

Senior Sister always wore Dan Feng plain clothes before.

Even if she went far away.

But now, Xia Ge has never seen that piece of Dan Feng on her sleeve.

What does this represent? Xia Ge is not stupid.

For her, Xia Ge made Senior Sister abandon the Lingxi Peak that she had always protected.

Xia Ge has no conscience.
"I also feel guilty," Gu Peiju held the person in her arms, her gentle voice scattered in the warm spring sun.

"You," she said with a mix of helplessness and cherishment, the remaining bit of tenderness hidden in the wind, silent and unnoticed.
