Xia Wushuang's puppetry was exquisite, coupled with the assistance of the government and widespread publicity, there would always be people who were on the brink of death, but still held onto a glimmer of hope and came to her.

When the first person was resurrected through the puppet's body, faced with the frenzy of ordinary people, Xia Wushuang understood that with her help, the King of Chu could surely reign over the world.

According to the usual way, cultivators were already going against the natural order and should not interfere with worldly affairs. Once they took action, it could result in hindrance in their cultivation at best, or even heavenly punishment at worst.

Other cultivators cherished their feathers and would naturally not wade into these muddy waters.

But Xia Wushuang was a latecomer to this world, not even knowing who she was when she arrived and was even kidnapped by bandits. If it weren't for Chu Shi's intervention, she probably wouldn't even know how she died.

Then, they pretended to be bandits, but never actually committed any banditry. Xia Wushuang also learned of the princess's identity, which saved her from the confusion and wandering.

Later, when she woke up with a hazy memory, she learned that she was not from this world, let alone bound by any rules.

She, Xia Wushuang, only did what she wanted to do, loved whoever she wanted to love, even if it meant sacrificing her life and dying without a burial place, it was all her own business.

Gratitude should be repaid with even greater kindness.

-There's nothing to regret.

Doudou looked at the memory of Xia Wushuang, who was once full of spirit and had gambled everything, and said with some sadness: "Those who say they have no regrets, just don't know the cost."

In a hundred years, Gu Peijiu naturally knew what the cost of the puppetry that could bring the dead back to life was.

But she couldn't do anything.

In this memory that had already passed, in front of the flowing river of time, she could only silently watch her step by step towards the endless abyss.

Once Xia Wushuang's reputation spread, the Lingxi Peak, which was originally a bandit's den, suddenly became famous. Countless people who wanted to seek immortality came to learn from her, and of course, there were also countless dying people who were willing to pay a high price to ask Xia Wushuang to extend their lives.

Xia Wushuang did not refuse anyone who came to learn from her, and directly taught the methods. For those who came to extend their lives, she made puppets to prolong their lives.

But for the puppets that were resurrected from the dead, whether they were made by her or by other puppeteers who had learned the secret technique, there was only one requirement.

That was to "join the army."

For unruly puppets, Xia Wushuang's response was simple. There was a prohibition in the secret technique, and those who violated it would explode and die.
The prohibition was written clearly for all those seeking survival.

Xia Wushuang worked day and night, not leaving her small workshop for several days.

Su Chan advised her not to tire herself out.

Xia Wushuang said, "No, I need to be faster."

Su Chan asked, "Why must it be like this? Would Chu Wang definitely be defeated without these puppets? Can't the soldiers also..."

Xia Ge interrupted her and said, "It's not the same."

"In this way, with more puppet soldiers, the people won't be forced into conscription, taxes will also decrease, and with one more puppet, there will be one less widow or orphan."

"...Giving hope to the dead and a dream of peace to the living."

Xia Wushuang looked at the puppet materials, her eyes shining brightly. "When the war is over, I believe A Shi can bring light to this country."

Su Chan was unhappy, but she didn't say anything and just crouched at the door with Gu Peiju, watching over Xia Wushuang.

"She'll kill herself," Su Chan said. "People who cultivate the Dao cannot interfere with worldly affairs. She's like this, and I'm not happy."

Gu Peiju, with her snow-white sleeves untouched by dust, stood on the other side, not saying anything.

"And that Chu Shi, she doesn't even like her," Su Chan said. "Why does she have to do this for her?"

Gu Peiju glanced at her.

"What are you looking at?" the red-clothed little girl said, her fair feet bare. "I hate her, and I don't like you either."

After speaking, she stopped talking.

Gu Peiju thought, this little girl is really too much. Clearly, she was the one speaking, but when she looked at her, she was the one accused.

Soon, with the secret method of resurrection and the homemade small puppets helping out, Xia Wushuang prepared a puppet army of thirty thousand for Chu Shi.

Doudou said, "This is really not right."

"It's just that at the time, everyone was dreaming and forgot to look at the abyss beneath their feet."

When Xia Ge woke up again, she was already back at the Thousand Soul Sect.

The soft white carpet covered the ground, and the silk on her body was soft and smooth. The desert was cold, but the warm fireplace flickered with flames, filling the room with warmth.

The black Zhentian soul was still on her body.

How did she suddenly come back?

Xia Ge was a little confused.

There was a blank in her memory, and she struggled to think about it. It seemed like she had been caught in the rain, saw her senior sister's shadow... and then nothing.

She didn't remember anything.

"...Miss, you should rest a little longer."

A cautious voice sounded, and Xia Ge raised her eyes to see a young maid in a green dress kneeling under the bed, holding a tray with a bowl of bird's nest soup that was steaming with fragrance. "The leader said that Miss suddenly fainted from being caught in the rain and may be a bit weak... and asked you to wake up and have something to drink."

Xia Ge pursed her lips and lifted the quilt off the bed. "I don't want to drink, take it away."

The little maid was so scared that she cried, but didn't dare say anything, only nodding timidly. "Yes... yes."

Seeing her like this, Xia Ge's heart softened a little, but she still sounded harsh. "If I don't drink it, what can she do to you?"

The little maid shook her head like a drum. "Nothing..."

"I won't do anything to her."

The door was quietly opened, and a girl came in wearing a soft white fur cloak, her footsteps light.

Xia Ge didn't want to see her and put on her shoes to leave.

Su Chan didn't stop her, just flipped her hand and draped the cloak over Xia Ge's body, smiling. "It's cold outside."

Xia Ge said coldly, "Then let me freeze to death."

"Why are you so stubborn with me?" Su Chan paused slightly, then smiled again. "You're like a child."

"Are you mad that the person hasn't woken up yet?"

Xia Ge clenched her fists.
"I gave you the antidote, it's your own fault for not believing me." Su Chan shrugged, a faint smile on her lips. "There's no need to be upset at this time."

Xia Ge didn't say anything and walked out the door.

It was indeed very cold outside.

...

Xia Ge snapped out of her thoughts.

The barren wilderness of the north in early spring still had the chill of winter. She wandered aimlessly, still thinking about her senior sister whom she had seen that day.

Her senior sister was sleeping peacefully.

The design of the Qianhun Sect was quite clever. Although it looked like an endless wilderness outside, inside it was a winding corridor with flying eaves and corners, and planted with holly and iron trees. In a small corner, there was a trembling and towering winter jasmine tree in bloom.

She walked around and, unconsciously, came to a spacious courtyard. She looked up and saw a pear tree in the middle of the courtyard.

It is said that the pear blossoms bloom overnight, covering thousands of trees.

However, this pear tree had no blossoms, no snow-white color, and was just a withered tree without even a single leaf. Xia Ge felt a little strange and depressed.

Planting trees in the courtyard was considered a taboo in feng shui, and few people would plant a tree in the center of the courtyard, and this tree seemed to be...dead?

But even if it was withered, it was still tall and imposing. She had to look up to see the dense, slanting and black branches that intertwined with each other, and could imagine how prosperous it would be when it bloomed.

"This tree has been planted here for many years." The woman's voice was very soft. "It's hard for you to come and see it."

Xia Ge was startled, and in the next moment, the pitch-black sickle with the town soul cloud pattern swung out, but stopped just before it was about to cut the woman's throat.

The sickle was sharp, and the sound of the chain was piercing, but the woman didn't even move, looking at her with gentle eyes.

The snow-white cloud pattern on the black sickle slowly faded away, but Xia Ge didn't retract it. "...Who are you?"

She had a vague guess in her heart.

The woman sighed softly.

"...You should call me mother."

-Qin Yue.
Xia Ge put away the sickle, feeling complicated.

She couldn't really treat this person as her own mother, but if she ignored her, she felt that something was not quite right.

"Speaking of this pear tree, there is a story behind it."

Seeing Xia Ge not speaking, Qin Yue didn't insist and didn't approach her. The distance between the two was only four steps, just the length of a sickle. She also looked up at the withered pear tree and spoke casually about irrelevant past events. "When you were very young, Bai Luo told you that there was a Zhuchen village in the north, where a large area of pear trees were planted outside the village. In April and May, the pear trees would bloom..."

Xia Ge had been silent all along.

"You kept pestering me to take you there to see it, and if I didn't let you see it, you would throw a tantrum." Qin Yue said, "At that time, when you threw tantrums, you only threw bottles and miscellaneous items..."

But for some reason, she became more and more irritable and liked to see blood when doing things. At a young age, throwing tantrums turned into chopping off people's fingers, gouging out people's eyes, and wiping out entire families.

Xia Ge glanced at her.

To be honest, she was not very interested in the past of this body.

But even if she didn't want to, she still had to take some responsibility for occupying someone else's body.

The body belonged to someone else, and it was also raised by parents. It was not easy to come by.

Qin Yue paused, shook her head, and brought the topic back. "At that time, there were many affairs, and although Qianhun Sect seemed peaceful, it was actually turbulent. I had few confidants, and Bai Luo and Bai Ren were still young. When I finally had time to accompany you, the pear blossoms had already withered."

"...You were very sad." Qin Yue said, "And angry that I didn't care about you and had someone else move this tree here without knowing where it came from, and insisted on planting it yourself."

Xia Ge looked at the masterpiece in the center of the courtyard.

"...Everyone advised you to move the pear tree to the side and not plant it in the middle, but you were the young master of the sect after all, and you were stubborn and didn't listen to anyone." Qin Yue sighed lightly. "My words, of course, were not listened to either."

"Why did it have to be planted in the middle?" Xia Ge asked.

Qin Yue said, "Just wanted to see the courtyard filled with pear blossoms. I was too lazy to plant a whole courtyard of pear trees, so I just planted it in the middle so that no matter which angle you look at it from, you can see it."

Xia Ge: "..."

"But this tree never bloomed until...it died." Qin Yue said, with a hint of regret.

Time passed, and the little girl who had hoped for a courtyard full of pear blossoms had grown into a graceful young woman, but she had long forgotten her childhood innocence and naivety.

"...Talking about this is meaningless."
After a while, Xia Ge heard her own voice, "I don't remember anything."

Qin Yue said, "You suffered."

"... "

After a pause, Xia Ge heard herself say, "I never felt like I was suffering before."

She turned to Qin Yue and said in a flat tone, "But after finding out who I am, I feel like I am suffering now."

She felt like she shouldn't be speaking in Qin Shuang's tone, as her position should only be that of a lonely soul occupying someone else's body. What she should do is remain silent and even turn around and leave.

But Xia Ge was clear that she couldn't do that, she couldn't remain isolated and helpless. She wanted to find someone who could stand by her side.

Qin Yue was silent for a while, then looked up at her with a calm expression and asked, "What do you want?"

"... "

Xia Ge clenched her fists.

"I know what you want," Qin Yue said with a light sigh when Xia Ge didn't respond for a while, "but the leader likes you."

Xia Ge was slightly startled.

"She likes you," Qin Yue walked to the pear tree and stroked the bark of the withered tree, "but she's also worried."

"... I don't want to hear this," Xia Ge felt a little uneasy all over.

Qin Yue said, "If you don't want to hear it, I won't say it."

"But I just want to say... you need to understand," Qin Yue turned around and looked at her, "If someone falls in love with you, then no matter what, you won't be at a disadvantage."

"When she looks at you... the way she looks at you, I'm very familiar with it."

It was the look she had when she was madly in love with someone, the look she saw in her own eyes when she looked back in the mirror, the infatuation of her youth.

Because of that infatuation, she did countless foolish things for him that she could never turn back from.
"..." Xia Ge said, "I don't understand what you're saying."

"She likes you, and you hold the blade that can hurt her," Qin Yue said. "Perhaps occasionally, your hand may be hurt by the blade that loses control, but... most of the time, she is willing to put the handle of the knife in your hand."

"Whether to break the knife or stab it into her heart."

"Even if it hurts so much that you can hardly bear it, it should be willingly endured."

A desperate, moth-to-flame kind of love.

Harming others and harming oneself.
