Xia Ge calmed herself down to think.

The system said, "...Did you get captured by a Yimei?"

Xia Ge was surprised, "Yimei?"

The system replied, "Yes."

From the system, Xia Ge learned that Yimeis were usually formed by incomplete souls that attached themselves to clothing, becoming something tangible from something intangible. However, some Yimeis would actively absorb strong souls to make themselves more complete.

Doudou was just a new ghost and couldn't move living beings. The only ones who could manipulate her were Yimeis.

But this place...

It didn't seem right.

A rustling sound was heard.

As the sky gradually darkened and the sunset stretched out, Xia Ge turned her head and saw a flurry of peach blossoms. However, the rustling sound disappeared.

Xia Ge narrowed her eyes and turned her head back as if nothing had happened.

The sound started again, softly and unconcerned.

With a flash of cold light in her hand, Xia Ge threw her sickle towards the source of the sound!

"Clang!"

The sound of clashing metal rang out, the wind howled, and Xia Ge's ghostly figure flashed away. Where she had stood, a large piece of land was shattered by the huge branches, and thick roots emerged from the broken soil. Xia Ge caught the flying sickle and her eyes turned into green animal pupils. Looking down...

The peach blossoms, which had been blooming gently, were now trembling and the petals were flying. They were uprooted and some pale bones mixed with the soil were overturned by the roots. Along with the scent of wine, Xia Ge's sharp eyes even saw several human skulls!

The whole village was shaking violently, and the oppressive resentment began to spread. The crazy branches stretched towards Xia Ge, but her sickle struck them, and the peach wood that had been gentle before was now as hard as steel. With one swing of the sickle, her arm went numb, but it was useless!

The scent of peach blossom wine came from underground, accompanied by the smell of decay.

[Peach Blossom Ghost: An evil ghost that parasitizes peach trees, eats human flesh, absorbs resentment, and brews peach blossom ghost wine, which can make peach blossoms bloom forever and make branches indestructible.]

Xia Ge jumped on the branches, her black hair flying, her figure like the wind, and the Peach Blossom Ghost could not catch her slightest trace.

This was actually a Peach Blossom Ghost village!
Doudou-

System: "...it's also possible that Doudou was captured by these peach blossom ghosts?"

Xia Ge asked, "What do they want with Doudou?"

System: "If Doudou becomes a demon, then it becomes one of them, right?"

Xia Ge was stunned. In the next moment, a tree shadow flashed by and tore a piece of her clothes.

Xia Ge quickly stepped back and held onto her sickle tightly, gritting her teeth. "You're quite clever."

System: "...it's easy to figure out."

Putting aside whether it's easy or not, with her there, these messy peach blossom ghosts won't even think about touching a hair on Doudou's head!

Xia Ge stood on a tree, took out the Eight Desolate Flute, and shook her spiritual power. The next moment, a melodious flute sound pierced through the sky and earth!

= =

The soft peach blossoms fell to the ground.

"The heavens do not tolerate it, the gods will fall." A gentle and mellow male voice, with a hint of melancholy, "The end is near."

A soft female voice comforted him gently, "Life is like a mayfly, there is always death. In the world, there are countless cycles, and the end is not necessarily not a relief."

Doudou felt warm hands holding both of her paws, one on each side.

"We can't stay here for long." The male voice sighed softly, "Fortune gods close their eyes, disaster gods hide in the shadows. Hopefully, we can come back before the end."

"It's hard to return to our homeland, but we should be indifferent to life and death." The female voice was calm, "The world is not bad either."

"Anywhere in the world is good." The male voice was gentle, "But we are ultimately gods, and the divine realm is where we should return."

Only in the divine realm can the gods rest in peace.

The female voice was silent for a long time.

Doudou was a little anxious. She really wanted to hear the two of them talk, say anything, anything would do.
"The peach blossoms here never wither and are very beautiful," the female voice murmured. "I... also really like this place."

"I placed the god's shrine under the largest peach tree," the male voice said. "Ayun, even if the days pass and no one worships, we will always be together."

"Okay," the female voice replied.

- Okay.

Dou Dou woke up suddenly.

Her soul was thin and fragile, as if it could dissipate at any moment. Her transparent body was tied up with thin ropes, and all around her were scattered peach blossom petals.

It was her father god and mother goddess.

She couldn't remember their faces, nor her own name.

But she remembered... she had to bring their ashes back to the god's shrine.

That was where they should rest.

But she couldn't remember where the god's shrine was.

The noise around her slowly brought her back to reality.

"Haha, look, look what we caught -"

"A god's soul!"

"An incomplete, restless god's soul?"

"Poor thing, the heavens won't accept the gods, so we'll have to make do with it."

"Little one, do you remember your name?"

Who was speaking?

Dou Dou looked around, all she could see were the swaying peach blossoms and the ropes binding her. She paused for a moment and said, "Let me go."

"Hey, don't be in a hurry, we'll let you go later - as long as you answer our questions."

"We're just curious, hehehe."
A voice asked, "Do you remember who you are?"

Doudou, who didn't remember anything, also sensed a strange malice.

Although she didn't understand much, she could sense that these things were different from Xia Jiejie.

Doudou said, "I don't remember."

The voice was sinister, "Do you remember what you want?"

Doudou thought for a moment and said, "I want to send my parents' ashes back..."

Ashes!

The ashes of her parents' souls!!

The peach blossom ghosts were extremely excited.

Legend has it that the ashes of gods can fulfill people's wishes...

"Where are the ashes?" they asked greedily.

Doudou said, "They're with my sister."

Sister? Who?

The black-clothed girl who is still at the village gate?

The peach blossom ghosts considered it and stared at Doudou. That girl is not easy to deal with. They decided to put the ashes aside for now.

At least there is still a soul with a obsession who has forgotten their real name in front of them...

Although the person at the door is a bit tricky, as long as this soul becomes a demonic ghost before she breaks in, then everything will be simple!

Once the soul becomes a demonic ghost, they will be invincible under its protection!

"You can't send them back," the peach blossom ghost deliberately said, "you can't do anything in your current state."

Doudou said, "I will send them back."

"Where does your confidence come from?" the peach blossom ghost's voice was sinister, "You can't even pick up anything now unless you become a Yimei-"
"Big sister promised me that she would help me... she would take me back," Dou Dou said. "I believe her."

"Oh, that's really touching," the Peach Blossom Ghost said, and a black piece of fabric floated in front of Dou Dou, caught by a thin branch. "Is this the thing you were talking about?"

The black piece of fabric.

Dou Dou could feel Xia Ge's presence on it, and her heart sank, but she tried to act as if nothing was wrong. "Yes."

The Peach Blossom Ghost sneered. "She's dead."

"You're lying!" Dou Dou blurted out.

"Why would I lie to you?" the Peach Blossom Ghost said. "She's really dead! It's all because of you. You made her help you, and she died for you. You can't do anything right now, you're just a burden."

Everyone was talking at once, as if it were all true.

"No, that's not true," the naive Dou Dou said, feeling flustered. "You're lying to me, it's impossible, you're lying to me."

"Why would I lie to you?" the Peach Blossom Ghost asked.

Dou Dou was at a loss for words.

"What a pity," the Peach Blossom Ghost said. "You definitely won't be able to fulfill your obsession now."

Xia Ge... is dead?

She won't be able to send Father God and Mother God home...?

"Do you really have to send them back?" the Peach Blossom Ghost asked.

The rope on her body had somehow come undone, and Dou Dou was floating in place, so...?

"It's all your fault!"

"It's all because of you!"

She had caused Xia Jiejie's death, she had asked her for help, and that's why Xia Jiejie died...

It was all her fault.

She should have done these things herself from the beginning, but because of her cowardice, her inability to complete them, and ultimately, because of her incompetence, she couldn't.
Why does she, who is so incompetent, still struggle to survive?

Why does she have to die?

Why... if she had to die, why did she have to drag Sister Xia down with her?

Faint black mist began to drift from her pure white soul, and the peach blossom ghosts stared at her attentively, holding their breath and suppressing their unparalleled excitement.

A powerful soul could have the power to surpass the ancient demons, while a fallen evil spirit also had the power to destroy the world.

And they were about to witness its birth!

The transparent soul was tainted by darkness, and the girl's bright eyes slowly became hollow.

There was no hope left, if she were to fall...

Sister Xia...

Just at this moment!

A long and melodious flute sound rang out!

The gentle flute sound and the piercing screams formed a sharp contrast.

"Ah--"

The peach blossom ghosts subconsciously looked towards the source of the sound, only to see a girl with a broken black dress, carrying a sickle on her back, standing tall on a frozen peach blossom ghost. Her jade flute stood upright, the moonlight like snow, setting off her cold and bright eyes.

In an instant, the terrifying pressure seemed to sweep across the sky, like a dragon emerging from the world, shaking for eternity.

Where the flute sound drifted, all the peach blossom ghosts trembled subconsciously, shivering and unable to say a word.

They were just peach blossom ghosts, nothing to fear.

Xia Ge's eyes were cold, her clothes fluttering. The pressure of the dragon and the violent power of the eight wilderness flute tearing through the void made these rural evil spirits deeply feel their own insignificance and ignorance.

Doudou's pure soul was already half blackened, and a gloomy and cold aura overflowed from her body. She looked up at the girl high above, and for a moment, she felt that she was particularly ugly.

So ugly.

Her hollow eyes reflected the girl's bright and cold pupils, and they looked at each other in silence.
... Sister Xia didn't die.

- She still looks so beautiful.

It's just that her pure soul has long been contaminated, her divine spirit is no longer there, and she is destined to sink.

Dou Dou stared into Xia Ge's eyes, and her empty eyes slowly lit up.

If the obsession of being born as a god is to find the hometown, then the obsession of turning into a ghost is you.

Love at first sight.

This is her hero.

It's her naive desire.

... It's the source of her downfall.

The black gas is still spreading.

Xia Ge felt uneasy and quickly jumped off the branch, touched Dou Dou's head, and the forest's black mist was about to wrap around Xia Ge's hand. Dou Dou murmured, "Aren't you afraid?"

"There's nothing to be afraid of."

Black mist is often the obsession that evil spirits cannot complete.

When Xia Ge broke into the evil spirit camp before... she had experienced this.

She has seen too much of the helplessness and sadness of evil spirits.

The only way to resolve their resentment is to tell them with full confidence-

"I can help you fulfill your wish." Xia Ge said, "I will definitely do it."

The black mist that was about to touch Xia Ge suddenly dissipated.

As if afraid of something, it shrank back.

Then the black color faded away, and Dou Dou's soul was as pure white as before.

There were only a pair of eyes, black as midnight, unable to see into the distance.
"I remember where my home is," Dou Dou touched Xia Ge's eyes and spoke softly, "Just keep heading east, and you'll get there."

- It doesn't matter anymore.

This person... is now her obsession.

What she found unacceptable just now wasn't that she couldn't find her hometown.

It was that she had lost this person.

"Let's go, I'll take you there," Xia Ge said, grabbing a peach blossom ghost with one hand and revealing a cold aura, "Hand over all the wine you've hidden!"

"Yes, yes, yes..."

The peach blossom ghosts trembled in fear of the dragon's pressure emanating from Xia Ge, and handed over the wine.

Xia Ge sniffed it, narrowed her eyes, and smashed the wine on the spot, laughing leisurely, "I don't want wine made with human blood."

Her smile was gentle, "What if I chop you all up now and turn you into wine?"

Then she looked ferocious, "If you dare to kidnap again, be prepared! Give me your best wine, or I'll chop you up!"

The peach blossom ghosts were scared stiff by her, and not a single tree dared to move. Finally, an old and aged tree shivered over and handed her a small gourd.

"This is a hundred-year-old peach blossom wine that I've been cherishing..." The old peach tree said, "Consider it as an apology, please don't laugh at us."

Xia Ge sniffed it, there was no smell of human blood, so she accepted it and left with Dou Dou.

Not a single peach blossom ghost dared to stop them.

The village where Xia Ge had stayed before was littered with corpses of peach blossom ghosts torn apart by the Eight Wilderness Flute. "Unbreakable" branches encountered the Eight Wilderness World that was strong enough to tear apart dragons, which was an absolute joke.

Xia Ge was satisfied and content, leading Dou Dou away. However, she felt like her hair had become a bit shorter, maybe due to excessive use of spiritual power.

It was as if her whole body was regressing.

Xia Ge took the opportunity when Dou Dou wasn't paying attention and asked the system.

The system's explanation was that it was due to the Time River she had crossed before.
