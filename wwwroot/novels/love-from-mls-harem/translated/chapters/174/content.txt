Su Chan pondered.

Did she regret it?

She had planned for so long, overcome countless obstacles, and sailed through a thousand storms. In the end, it was all because of a single look from her that she let go.

Su Chan felt like she regretted it, but she didn't really understand what regret felt like. She always thought she would come back.

But once a person leaves, how can they come back?

It was ridiculous that she, who had lived for nearly a thousand years, still couldn't understand this simple truth.

The girl in red walked slowly, able to hear the sounds of fierce fighting outside. Those who claimed to be righteous but actually coveted things that didn't belong to them were receiving their deserved punishment.

And the pain they suffered from their greed, the hatred they generated, and the price they paidâ€”

People always like to shift responsibility.

But someone has to take responsibility.

Su Chan thought of the girl who had to bear everything.

Whenever she thought of her, she always remembered their first meeting at the ancestral tomb.

She pretended to be bound by vines, barely alive.

Back then...

-"Trust me!"

-"...I will definitely save you!!"

She called her Xia Xia insincerely, but she sincerely risked her life to save her.

With pure sincerity and passionate enthusiasm.

Even Blood Stains the Spring and Autumn could be moved by those fervent eyes.
Su Chan, who was heartless, never showed any mercy to anyone she didn't care about.

"If she doesn't want you," Su Chan chuckled and brought up lovesickness, "why don't you be with me?"

The lovesickness remained motionless in her hand, giving no response.

"You're scared," Su Chan said casually, tying it into a butterfly knot on her fingertip, like a small red ring.

"But you don't have any room to refuse."

The lovesickness pretended not to hear.

Su Chan didn't care either. "Since you've been left behind, it means she came here with the town spirit."

But...

Without the power of the old ancestor's soul, no one could cultivate the heavenly symbol.

Although she vaguely felt that something was wrong, Su Chan wasn't worried.

Stepping into the stone chamber at the end of the corridor, Su Chan looked up and casually scanned the room. As expected, the abandoned wooden puppet from before was gone, presumably disposed of.

However, when she saw the intact red symbol on the golden symbol array on the stone table, Su Chan's pupils suddenly contracted!

"Impossible!"

Su Chan, who always smiled lightly and carefree, felt that she couldn't laugh anymore.

It was as if she had suddenly arrived at the extreme north of the ice field, her whole body suspended in the icy and bone-chilling seawater, unable to move a single bit.

"...Impossible!"

She remembered what she had said.

"Mount Evil Spirit is my life's work."

"...I hope...the innocent souls inside will rest in peace forever."

"I don't want anyone to get close to it..."

"..."
Su Chan remembered every word that Xia Wushuang had said.

"The heavenly talisman inside can only be moved by me, and only I can repair it."

Before Xia Wushuang left, she made a heavenly talisman that only her unique soul could approach as a "door" to seal the evil spirits.

Originally, Su Chan had no way to destroy the heavenly talisman.

But...

"I no longer... trust anyone."

"Can I trust you?"

But Xia Wushuang trusted her.

So, she gave her a soul wood seed that contained a trace of her own soul.

The grown soul wood could mimic her soul, approach the heavenly talisman, and destroy or save it easily.

And the puppet that destroyed the red talisman before was made of soul wood.

Su Chan closed her eyes.

...And now, the heavenly talisman has been repaired.

It took a long, long time.

Maybe it was just a moment, maybe it was a long time.

Su Chan laughed.

"Hahaha..."

The laughter was small, thin, and slow...

"Hahahaha-"

It got louder and louder, almost like crazy laughter.

Xiangsi was scared, holding onto her fingers, trembling all over.
Su Chan stared at the sky symbol rotating continuously on the golden formation, her eyes widened with ecstasy. "You're back!!"

So, it was true - so, it was true...

Su Chan covered her chest, her heart beating fervently. Her breathing was unstable, sometimes restless, sometimes gentle, and sometimes crazy, shaking the entire stone room.

Her eyes turned black and red alternately.

You're back, it's better than anything else.

Xia Wu Yin, Xia Wu Shuang, no wonder, no wonder!!!

She had felt the similarity a long time ago!

She had always looked down on Gu Peijiu, thinking that she had only fallen in love with a fake, but she never thought that she was the one who was blinded in the end.

It was just that she was too paranoid, thinking that no one except Xia Wu Shuang was worthy of her love.

No one could be similar to Xia Wu Shuang, even a little bit was not enough.

Even though she knew she was also moved.

But she could be cold to everyone, including herself.

So what if she was moved? In this life, the only person who could make Su Chan move to the point of death was Xia Wu Shuang.

However, when facing Xia Wu Yin, she would feel a little scared.

She didn't know what she was afraid of.

Perhaps she was just afraid that one day, she couldn't wait any longer.

So she treated Xia Wu Yin as a pawn that she could abandon at any time, playing with her in the palm of her hand.

She was more ruthless than Gu Peijiu and even more cruel to herself.

"It's really...dramatic."

It took a long time for Su Chan's breathing to calm down. She looked at the red symbol, and her eyes turned into different colors.

Her left eye was black, and her right eye was bright red, looking beautifully eerie.
Always like this.

Fate always finds a way to play with her.

After all the bad things she has done, fate suddenly reveals the truth, mocking her self-righteousness.

Maybe it's revenge.

But... it doesn't matter.

Su Chan laughed softly, her laughter low and shallow, not as crazy as before, but with an indescribable darkness and gloominess.

In this gloom, there is a mixture of joy, and some other things.

"It doesn't matter..." she murmured, her white hand gently stroking the red talisman, which had just been repaired and still had a faint smell of blood, "you have come back after all."

"...you have come back, that's good."

If fate wants to take revenge on her in this way, she has no complaints.

Those who have never waited will never know how painful it is to wait endlessly.

She slept through countless hopeless waits, and then woke up in anticipation, only to face disappointment again and again.

Her return is the sweetest gift fate has given her.

She only feels happy.

Even if the other person hates her.

She still thinks it's lovely.

- In this world, she finally has the person she loves.

That's enough.

Even if she seeks crazy revenge on her, even if she kills her, it's okay.

Anything is fine.

As long as you are in my world.
You can do anything you want.

However, since you've already become a bad person, you might as well be completely bad.

Su Chan stared at the red talisman, her two eyes shining with infatuation, one black and one red, while her smile was shallow and gentle. "I'll always be your lucky charm."

Convert to me.

Even if you're covered in sin and despised by the world, I'll always open my arms to you.

You are my follower.

You must listen to the gods.

Even if you kill the gods with your own hands.

You must stay in her embrace.

Su Chan's hand trembled slightly, and in it was a piece of soul wood.

Xiao Xiangsi twisted frantically, trying to stop her, but Su Chan said, "You can't stop me."

Xiangsi couldn't understand Su Chan's thoughts.

- Why do you love her and hurt her at the same time?

Su Chan laughed softly.

"Because of her, I fell in love with someone else."

"I can't change her mind." Su Chan looked at the soul wood in her hand, her voice gentle. "And I fought too late."

Xiangsi: Why was it too late?

"Because I made a mistake." Su Chan paused and laughed softly. "And I deserved it."

She had always thought that Bai Gu Ai was Xia Wushuang's destined soul weapon. If Xia Wushuang returned, Bai Gu Ai would surely react.

When Xia Wu Yin appeared, despite being terrifyingly similar in every aspect, Bai Gu Ai did not react at all.

- Why didn't it react?
Su Chan was slightly startled, as if she had remembered something, and took out the bone flute, lightly brushing her fingers over it.

The next moment, her expression became solemn.

...There was no soul imprint on it.

Looking back now, when Xia Wushuang said she entrusted the soul weapon to her, she actually... gave it to her.

So, she must have erased her own soul imprint from the flute a long time ago.

But for this flute, she had always treasured it as a beloved item, even learning to play it and mastering everything Xia Wushuang knew about it.

Su Chan was a genius, no worse than Xia Wushuang, and even surpassed her in some ways.

But in the end, she learned everything, the dust settled, and she still couldn't learn Xia Wushuang's carefree abandon.

She had never thought that this flute would be hers, so she never thought of engraving her soul imprint on it.

Perhaps if she had thought of it earlier...if she had been a little more carefree, maybe she would have realized that what she thought was the key to finding her lover was actually nothing.

It was just proof that Xia Wushuang had existed.

But she couldn't be carefree. She was deeply troubled by Xia Wushuang's departure.

So, facing the rightful owner, she was like a blind person, missing everything.

Love couldn't understand her thoughts.

-What you're doing is wrong.

"You're still too young to understand," Su Chan caressed the soul wood, the similar aura on it making her greedy for it, her gaze gentle. "By now, I don't care about right or wrong anymore."

She had walked down the wrong path and couldn't turn back.

Su Chan would always remember the ice-cold gaze of the girl looking up at her.

She stood in front of Gu Peijiu like a hero.

The cold blade pointed at her neck. 

Su Chan pondered Xia Wuyin's gaze.
She chuckled softly.

"...What lovely eyes."

Xia Wushuang, who had lived through one life and remembered nothing, still tried her best to protect everyone she could.

The cold blade always pointed forward, and her back was always for her loved ones.

In fact, there was no difference.

As long as you were in this world, there was... no difference.

Su Chan placed her left hand on her chest, feeling her heart beating incessantly.

"...As long as you're here."

"Nothing else matters."

The Soulwood turned into a palm-sized puppet in an instant, with small limbs and no face. It pattered onto the stage, grabbed the red talisman, and jumped up.

"Wait a minute."

The puppet holding the talisman tilted its head and looked at its owner, who was smiling gently and looking a little lost.

Su Chan bit her finger and used her blood to draw a brilliant smiley face on the puppet's face.

If Xia Ge were here, she would be horrified.

That face was exactly the same as the puppet that Gu Peiju had given her.

Su Chan chuckled softly. "This time, I won't let go."

The puppet was excited to have a face and raised both hands, tearing the torn red talisman into pieces.

From then on, the wailing of evil spirits echoed through the sky!
