However, Chang Ren's words were a bit unsatisfactory.

"What do you mean by 'if we catch that little witch earlier, we will definitely get an answer'? That's nonsense. If it were that easy to catch her, no one would be listening to you whining here about the Sky Shattering Jewel."

Although the heroes felt that Chang Ren's words made sense, they all had the feeling that they had been played for no reason.

Without the gimmick of the Sky Shattering Jewel, the Chang family was just a slightly interesting family recently. No one wanted to help them.

Sometimes bankruptcy is just that simple.

Rumors about the Sky Shattering Jewel being stolen by Qin Shuang were also spreading. However, after a few days, it was just like the previous rumor about the Sky Shattering Jewel being stolen, and it was talked about everywhere. The Chang family had lost all face in this matter.

In the north, the Thousand Soul Sect.

The pear blossoms were beginning to wither.

The red-clothed girl held a flute and looked silently at the scattered flowers.

Her back seemed a bit lonely.

Qin Yue poured a pot of tea and said, "Leader."

Su Chan rubbed the bone flute in her hand and murmured, "Hmm."

Qin Yue looked at the scattered flowers and then at the red-clothed girl's back. Finally, she turned around. The dazzling white light that used to shine on the Thousand Soul Mountain was no longer as bright as before.

Since Shuang Shuang left, the pear tree had started shedding its flowers, and the light on the mountain had become dimmer and dimmer.

Perhaps others didn't know, but as the high priest who would temporarily assume the leader's responsibility in the absence of a deity, Qin Yue knew what the light on the mountain represented.

It was the Pure Spirit Pearl.

The Pure Spirit Pearl was a divine pearl that the God of Blessings was born with. When the gods were benevolent, it could purify all evil spirits, and when they were malevolent, it could corrupt all good souls in the world.

But the Pure Spirit Pearl of the God of Blessings had always been a mixture of good and evil, especially after Su Chan fell from grace, it was more evil than good.

However, when Shuang Shuang was still there, Qin Yue had personally gone up the mountain to see the Pure Spirit Pearl.

That pure and flawless pearl had no trace of evil, only a thick, compassionate and redeeming divine light that purifies the soul. As long as one stood in front of it, they would feel their soul being cleansed, as if all darkness would be purified.

The Pure Spirit Pearl had always represented the state of the deity, like a divine attribute.
During that time, she had never seen Su Chan kill anyone.

She seemed to have become a completely different person with a calm state of mind.

There was not the slightest bit of malice.

She had once searched through the records of the past high priests for information on the Pure Spirit Bead, which for the fallen god Su Chan was indeed an anomaly. Several generations of priests had seen this bead, and without exception, it was sometimes black and white, and sometimes entirely filled with dark and evil energy that brought disasters without hesitation.

No generation of priests had ever seen a truly pure Pure Spirit Bead.

In other words, it was indeed an anomaly.

After all, as a fallen god of fortune, Su Chan always had more malice than goodwill, just like a bad person who had done all sorts of bad things trying to instinctively have some kindness, like helping an old lady cross the road - it felt absurd to himself.

But even if it was absurd, the pure Pure Spirit Bead shone brightly for a whole month.

As long as that person was there, the Pure Spirit Bead would always shine like this.

As if proving something.

But now...

Qin Yue couldn't help but glance at the gradually dimming light on the mountain, thinking that there was probably no way to maintain that state anymore.

After all, it was possible to let a bad person help an old lady cross the road once, but it was a bit ridiculous to let a bad person do it every day. After all, they still had to do some side jobs like smashing things... Of course, this example might not be appropriate.

Su Chan, of course, did not go to smash things over there.

But judging from the current state of the Pure Spirit Bead, Qin Yue estimated that although Su Chan had been calm and silent all along, he probably wanted to go over and smash something.

"Gu Peijiu has already woken up," Qin Yue carefully chose her words, "The Chang family called for people to go up, but they returned empty-handed. The little priest... is unharmed."

"I know," Su Chan's voice was calm, without any emotion or intention to smash things.

Of course, he was not very happy either.

Qin Yue didn't say anything.

The drifting pear blossoms seemed a bit desolate.
Su Chan didn't think about causing any trouble.

She just thought about a long time ago.

It was a very long time ago... for her, it couldn't be called distant.

At that time, Xia Wushuang was trying to atone for her sins, and she was waiting outside the Evil Spirit Mountain for the day when she would come out.

Just like Xia Wushuang said, with time, everything will be let go.

Whether it's emotions... or the sins she valued.

Of course, she didn't just wait blindly. Xia Wushuang had said to her to find something she liked to do.

But in the mortal world, besides Xia Wushuang, there was nothing she liked.

There were many things she hated... or people.

For example, King Chu.

A slight breeze blew, lifting the pear blossoms on the ground.

"..." Su Chan slightly returned to her senses, and most of the pear blossoms on the ground had already fallen.

She murmured, "A lot has fallen."

Qin Yue said, "It will bloom again next year."

Su Chan shook her head, "It's not the same."

These were the flowers she had made bloom with her divine power.

She sighed lightly, "Whatever it is, there will be a day when it withers."

Qin Yue didn't understand, so she stopped talking.

The two of them were silent for a long time.

After a while, Su Chan raised her hand and caught a falling petal, suddenly starting a conversation.

"A long, long time ago, I liked a girl."
"I did everything I could to win her heart," said Su Chan in a soft voice. "I watched her do as she pleased, watched her part ways with her childhood sweetheart, watched her lead puppet soldiers into battles, watched her succumb to the influence of dark magic, watched her bid farewell to her most trusted puppet, and more..."

"I used to hate a lot of people," Su Chan smiled faintly, "but when it comes to the person I love, there has only ever been one."

"God does not show favoritism," said Qin Yue.

This was not a saying of Qin Yue's, but something she had read in an ancient priestly text.

If God favored one person, it would be difficult to maintain a fair and just stance - after all, God should be impartial, compassionate, and merciful to all living beings.

"That's the work of demons," Su Chan said nonchalantly, then looked towards the direction of the Priest's Temple not far away. "...It's not favoritism."

When one loves someone to the point of obsession, they may do some outrageous things.

Although Su Chan never thought what she did was that outrageous, she knew that just because she could accept it, didn't mean others could.

For example, when Xia Wushuang was confessing her sins in seclusion at the Evil Spirit Mountain, Su Chan told the high and mighty King Chu about everything Xia Wushuang had hidden from Chu Shi.

Su Chan furrowed her brows slightly.

King Chu knew her.

In fact, she knew more about everyone around Xia Wushuang than even Xia Wushuang herself did.

She still remembered the cold snowflakes that drifted into the palace at that time.

When she went, the high and mighty king was looking at a painting in a trance.

The peach blossoms were in full bloom, and the young girl held a branch of peach blossoms in her hand, looking back with a radiant smile, so lifelike that she seemed to be stepping out of the painting in the next second.

Su Chan wondered.

If King Chu hadn't been looking at that painting when she went, maybe she wouldn't have gone too far.

Of course, maybe not.
After all, the person in the painting was what Xia Wushuang had been longing for but could never obtain. She couldn't get it herself, but she didn't want anyone else to have it either. Even just the thought of it made her feel defiled and sacrilegious.

"Power really makes people forget all the sweet fruits," she said, slowly revealing everything Xia Wushuang had lost over the years to this cold and high Emperor.

She smiled and spoke nonchalantly, "She changed fate for the Emperor, created the unparalleled puppet soldiers for the Emperor... and overnight, helped the Emperor conquer a small country, earning a reputation that made the enemy tremble in fear."

"Finally, she died under the hooves of the rebels?"

"Doesn't the Emperor notice anything different?" she asked. "Does the Emperor know about the demon tide? Does the Emperor know... what a cursed fate is? Or, to put it simply, does the Emperor know what divine punishment is? If the Emperor doesn't know anything... then the Emperor is truly fortunate."

Perhaps Chu Shi would have been an outstanding general, but she clearly wouldn't have been a qualified emperor. Her excessive attachment doomed her to a tragic life.

Su Chan didn't regret what she had done. Another pear blossom fell, inexplicably causing a sense of melancholy. Su Chan furrowed her brows, and even after so many years, she still couldn't forget Xia Wushuang's pale face... It was so beautiful that it made people feel a sense of satisfaction.

Su Chan watched as the pear blossom slowly fell to the ground, and her lips curved into a slight smile.
Chu Shirang had the court historian erase all records related to that person, leaving only some irrelevant details. Then, as if in a dream, she added many records of the interactions between Lingxi Peak and the palace.

...even though everyone knew that it didn't exist.

But power is a sweet fruit.

With a single sentence, the court historian would be obedient and fearful. This was the sweetness that was obtained by treading on countless bones and using Xia Wushuang's blood and sins.

When the truth was revealed, it became a painful, bone-corroding poison.

Chu Shirang said, "...since you know everything, tell me, is she still alive?"

Su Chan looked at her.

This was the most noble person in the world.

Wearing a yellow robe and a high imperial crown, she now had a pale complexion and a slightly swaying figure, but she tried to maintain her composure as she looked at her, trying to obtain something more useful from her - something more useful about that person.

Su Chan saw in her eyes what she had seen countless times in the eyes of her followers when she was a goddess of fortune.

...hope.

The source of all faith.

It was precisely because of hope that people sought faith.

However, she was not the fortune goddess of that person and could not bring any good news to her.

Hope is a good thing.

So why give it to someone she hates?

Su Chan said, "...she's dead."

It was a very beautiful moment.

Su Chan would always remember the moment when all the light in the beautiful light brown apricot eyes faded away.
After the most dazzling fireworks in the world burst and shattered into ashes, the night sky fell into a dead silence.

It gave her an immense sense of pleasure.
