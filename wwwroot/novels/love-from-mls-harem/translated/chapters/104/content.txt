The idea that emerged mixed with spiritual energy, seeping into the pill furnace, blending into the two fist-sized pill liquids, dissolving the medicinal power in the juice, and finally condensed into two round and rolling snow-white pills.

At the moment the pills took shape, the spiritual energy dispersed and the world fell silent. The fragrant pill scent suddenly wafted out. Xia Ge raised her head, and her black eyes seemed to reflect the fiery red color in the furnace. She looked expressionless at the disciples of the Sword Peak who were staring at her. Those who met her gaze instinctively stepped back, and by the time they realized why they had retreated, Xia Ge had already withdrawn her gaze.

"He..." 

Chang Lan's hand on the hilt of his sword loosened slightly, but his gaze was fixed on the two snow-white pills being licked by the flames in the furnace. He trembled slightly.

Wei Yu was still not convinced. "Senior Brother, don't be fooled by her. This must be a poison..."

Before he could finish his sentence, he was suddenly pushed away. The master had apparently rushed over, his goatee trembling with excitement. "You've refined the Hundred Soul Pill?!"

At these words, everyone fell silent. The next moment, all eyes turned to the snow-white pills tumbling in the furnace, like hungry wolves seeing delicious meat, and green light flashed in their eyes.

[Ding! Congratulations to the host for refining the Twin Hundred Soul Pill · Profound · Intermediate, reward 100 points!]

[Ding! Congratulations to the host for advancing to a formal Profound Level Alchemist, reward 50 points!]

[Keep up the good work, host!]

Xia Ge bowed to the master. "Thank you for your guidance. I won't disappoint you."

The master was unable to contain his excitement, and he grasped Xia Ge's hand. "Our Dan Peak... finally has a second Profound Level Alchemist!"

Chang Lan moved his lips, looking at the young man in the Dan Feng attire, but he found that he couldn't say anything.

The person they thought was a spy had just refined the Hundred Soul Pill that they needed most, and had been promoted to a Profound Level Alchemist on the spot.

No matter how you looked at it, their trip here seemed like a joke.

Xia Ge thanked the master warmly, waved her hand slightly, and the two pills wrapped in spiritual energy and pill fragrance flew out of the furnace with a "whoosh". The master caught them carefully and put them in a box to prevent the loss of their medicinal properties.

The master handed the box to Xia Ge and said solemnly, "This is yours."

Xia Ge looked towards the door, and everyone instinctively made way for her. She walked past Chang Lan, her voice faintly tinged with a mocking smile.

"If the essence of a swordsman is to slay demons and monsters, shouldn't the essence of an alchemist be to save the people?"

Wei Yu wanted to rush forward to say something, but he clenched his fists and held back in the end, glaring at Xia Ge but unable to say a word.

Chang Lan fell silent for a while, then said, "No one is asking you to save the people."
Xia Ge chuckled, "I think so too, after all, I am a spy for the demonic cult."

"Big Senior Brother, it must have been difficult for you to bring people here in the middle of the night," she added.

With that, she left the alchemy room, leaving the others staring at each other in confusion.

Chang Lan said, "..."

The system asked, "What were you thinking about when you were refining the pill just now?"

After thinking about it for a moment, the system felt that the question was too informal and changed it to a more serious one, "Did you find the true essence of being an alchemist?"

"I did," Mao Qing replied while resting. Xia Ge glanced at the people who had come out of the alchemy room one by one, staring at her with complicated expressions. She lowered her voice and said, "To save the people."

The system was speechless.

Feeling uneasy, Xia Ge glanced behind her and saw the people coming out of the alchemy room one by one. She went into the guest room and closed the door behind her.

The gentle moonlight spilled in from the window.

"In fact, there shouldn't be any true essence to being an alchemist," Xia Ge said.

The system asked, "Hmm?"

"Because at that time, I wasn't thinking about anything," she replied.

Mao Qing was sleeping soundly. Xia Ge looked out the window at the silver moonlight and took out the token. She rubbed her fingertips over the maple leaf on it and whispered, "If I had to say..."

"Before refining the pill, I was only thinking that I didn't want to disappoint her."

"That wouldn't be good."

Since Senior Sister had entrusted her with the command token, she must have the ability to live up to it.

Otherwise, such a good token would be ridiculed in her hands.

Xia Ge murmured, "That's too much, and I would be angry."

Chu Yi had already come down from the mountain protection array and was recording the injured in the dormitory. After recording the ones who were poisoned and the ones who weren't, she planned to run over to Chang Lan's place to deliver the message.
"Is Senior Chang at Sword Peak?"

Chu Yi casually asked someone.

The person shook their head at the mention of it. "He's not at Sword Peak... he seems to have gone to the school at Dan Peak to catch a spy?"

Chu Yi raised an eyebrow slightly. "Then I'll go to Dan Peak to deliver it."

Carrying the scroll, she went up to Dan Peak. The green stone steps were layered one on top of the other, and the snow-white flowers were scattered on the ground. As she walked, she passed by a familiar place.

The parasol trees were dense, and there was a small house underneath, with lush vegetation outside the door.

Chu Yi glanced at it.

Xia Wu Yin's dormitory.

The protagonist of today's play to catch a spy.

Chu Yi withdrew her gaze. Just as she was about to leave, the bell in her arms suddenly rang again!

At the same time, a violent spiritual energy fluctuation suddenly came from the direction of the school! Chu Yi instinctively took out the Wishing Bell that wouldn't stop shaking and looked towards the direction of the intense fluctuation.

...Coincidence?!

Or...

Chu Yi's mood was slightly excited.

At the same time, an old man with a goatee hurriedly rushed past her, excitedly saying, "Xia Wu Yin did it! She actually did it. We Dan Peak are finally going to have our second Profound Level alchemist..."

Chu Yi knew this was Dan Peak's teacher.

He said... Xia Wu Yin?

So, this fluctuation was caused by Xia Wu Yin?

The bell suddenly stopped ringing, but the spiritual energy fluctuation still remained. Chu Yi frowned and felt a vague sense of disappointment.

Chang Nian asked her to find his sister, but Xia Wu Yin was a boy, and the person she was looking for was a girl.

Chu Yi paused in place. The moon was bright and the wind was clear. She tidied up her mood and was about to go over to deliver the scroll to Chang Lan and check the situation in the school when a strange "rustling" sound suddenly came from somewhere.
The Master walked away quickly, not even bothering to glance at her. He was long gone, and there was no one around. However, the rustling sound persisted.

Chuyi looked up and saw that the sound was coming from beneath the window of the house. The window and door were tightly shut, and the wind was light. The moonlight was eerie, and the grass and leaves rustled. Chuyi narrowed her eyes and waved her sleeve, sending a few silver butterflies flying towards the rustling leaves.

But in an instant, a small piece of fabric, the size of a fingernail and indiscernible in color, suddenly shot up into the air. It grew longer and longer, becoming a five or six-foot-long blood-stained white cloth that rolled up and crushed the silver butterflies into pieces.

Just as Chuyi was about to draw her sword, the blood-stained white cloth suddenly unfurled. The only silver butterfly that wasn't crushed was stained with black blood and slowly flew towards Chuyi from the white cloth.

At the same time, a low voice came from the blood-stained silver butterfly, "Chu..."

Chuyi usually used silver butterflies to transmit messages or eavesdrop, but she never thought that one day, they would turn into something else.

She calmly took a step back and asked, "What are you?"

The silver butterfly fluttered, and its tone was slow, "I am probably... something that can fulfill your wishes."

Chuyi smiled, but her sword was already unsheathed, like a cold frost. "Sounds good."

"I want... to return to someone's side..."

"We can... make a trade."

The voice transmitted by the silver butterfly was a bit blurry, distant, and faintly hopeful. Chuyi remained expressionless and coldly calculated how much time it would take to cut down this creature, but the next moment, her hand holding the sword froze.

"I can let you know who the true owner of the silver bell is... "

Chuyi's hand holding the sword stiffened slightly, but her face remained unchanged. "But I don't want to know who she is."

"No... you want to know..." The white cloth with some black blood stains slowly approached, and the blood-stained silver butterfly also moved closer to her. "I can hear the dark desires of everyone's hearts, as well as their innermost corrupt longings..."

"I just heard your disappointment in not finding the answer in your heart."

The silver butterfly came closer.

Chuyi took a step back.
"Exchange with me... let me go back to that person's side."

Chuyi asked, "Whose side do you want to go back to?"

Yin Die's movements suddenly stopped, and the white cloth also froze in place, seemingly pondering.

Chuyi's sword flashed with a cold light for an instant, and the next moment, with a "stab" sound, the blood-stained white cloth and Yin Die were all shattered under her sword!

The girl in blue smiled at the corner of her mouth, but her eyebrows and eyes were indifferent. "It doesn't matter who it is."

"Although I like to use any means necessary to accomplish things, I don't like being coerced."

The blood-stained white cloth was cut into pieces and fell lightly to the ground, while the shattered Yin Die slowly trembled and pieced itself together in the moonlight.

A low voice sounded again, vaguely confused.

"I want to go back... to the person you want to find."

The person she wants to find?

Is this... Chang Nian's clothes demon?!

"I heard your answer in your heart..."

"Then... it's a deal."

Chuyi's footsteps suddenly stopped, and she turned to look at it, but she saw a small wind vortex forming on the white cloth, and then slowly expanding--

As soon as the words fell, a violent wind swept up a fierce ghostly aura, and in the next moment, the blood-stained white cloth, Yin Die, and Chuyi all disappeared without a trace. The expanding dark wind vortex began to shrink and disappeared completely.

The fallen scroll landed on the ground, and with a breeze, a piece of blood-stained cloth floated back to its original place. Apart from that, there was nothing else.
