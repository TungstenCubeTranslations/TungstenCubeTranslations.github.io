System: "......"

Gu Peijiu: "......"

Xia Ge remained calm and composed.

"Well," Gu Peijiu said, "let's try a different approach."

Xia Ge looked at her curiously.

"I'll ask, you answer," Gu Peijiu said, "you can answer however you want, tell the truth or lie, it's up to you."

Xia Ge was stunned. "Huh?"

She could lie? What was the point of that?

"Can I?" Gu Peijiu asked.

She could, but what was the point?

But since Gu Peijiu was asking, Xia Ge scratched her head. "Sure."

"First question, do you like it?" Gu Peijiu asked.

"What?" Xia Ge asked.

Like what?

Seeing Xia Ge's confusion, Gu Peijiu said, "Xiangsi."

Gu Peijiu thought for a moment and added, "It's a beautiful name."

Xia Ge: "......"

She probably called out "Xiangsi" too loudly when she was chasing the butterfly...

And given the situation at the time, it's no wonder her senior sister... had a deep impression.

But this question...

Seeing Gu Peijiu looking at her, Xia Ge stiffly nodded, "I like it."
Then she added, "I'm not lying about this!"

This was not a lie, she was very serious.

Gu Peijiu's eyes softened slightly and she smiled gently, just like when she gave her the fox mask.

Xia Ge suddenly felt a bit uneasy, she put her hands behind her back and avoided eye contact, "Um... why did you give me the sachet, Senior Sister?"

Gu Peijiu replied, "I promised you."

Xia Ge was confused, "Huh?"

Gu Peijiu looked at her, "For the peach blossom wine."

Speaking of peach blossom wine, Xia Ge hesitated for a moment before suddenly remembering. It was when she hadn't entered the Danfeng sect yet, and Senior Sister went to catch people in the Mo family village...

- When will I have a powerful and charming appearance?

- You'll have it after passing the exam.

So Senior Sister was already thinking of giving her the sachet back then?

Xia Ge was a little lost in thought, "Oh, I see."

...So it was like that.

So back then... Senior Sister wanted to give her the sachet?

Gu Peijiu made a sound of agreement, "Second question, why did you dress up as a man?"

Xia Ge: "..."

Why are you asking questions that are not very relevant to tonight?

Gu Peijiu looked at her, "Can't answer?"

"Well... it's not that, actually... it's nothing." Xia Ge thought for a moment and hesitated, "At first it was just safer, and later I got used to being called 'brother' by people. If I suddenly switched back, it would be... awkward."

Mainly because she was used to dressing as a man and getting along with the male lead, and it was also convenient for handling things.
The girl seemed troubled and embarrassed no matter how you looked at it.

She didn't expect to be discovered by Gu Peijiu in such an awkward and unexpected situation in the black market.

But even though she knew, she didn't say anything, and Xia Ge pretended that nothing had happened.

Thinking about this, Xia Ge couldn't help but ask, "Since you know that I'm a girl, why didn't you expose me?"

Gu Peijiu asked in confusion, "Do you want me to expose you?"

Xia Ge replied, "No."

Gu Peijiu nodded, "I thought so too. As you wish."

Xia Ge felt like it made sense, but something still felt off.

"In fact, as long as Ye Ze doesn't find out, it's fine. I always feel that after so many years, it won't be a big deal if others find out, but if he finds out, it might be hard to handle."

Imagine if you had a girlfriend who you always hung out with, and suddenly one day you found out she was a boy.

How terrifying.

Xia Ge felt at a loss for words even when she imagined it herself. Although boys and girls were different, if it were someone like Ye Ze, who had a finicky personality, who knows if he would make a big deal out of it.

It's better to say nothing and let him know nothing.

Gu Peijiu asked, "When do you plan on changing back?"

Xia Ge replied, "Let's talk about it later."

Are you really asking questions? Why does it sound like small talk?

Gu Peijiu suddenly said, "Your doll is missing."

Xia Ge's expression stiffened for a moment, and the corners of her lips slightly twitched.

If it wasn't mentioned, it would have been fine. But now that it was brought up, an indescribable bitterness spread in her heart, and her eyes were a little teary. She felt sad, as if someone had suddenly mentioned a person she would never see again.

"I'm too clumsy and accidentally dropped it," Xia Ge heard her own slightly hoarse voice, "It's gone... it shouldn't have fallen again."
Gu Peijiu sensitively noticed that Xia Ge's mood was not quite right. She paused for a moment and suddenly remembered something the child had said before.

That doll was given by a very important person.

At first, she didn't believe it.

This mischievous little brat, like a little fox, seemed to be joking and angry, with a charming appearance, but her heart was as hard as a rock that couldn't be opened even with a hammer.

Could such a hard-hearted little brat also have an important person?

But looking at her expression now, Gu Peijiu believed it a little.

Because she could tell that she was really upset.

After a while, Gu Peijiu reached out and took the towel in Xia Ge's hand, wiping her hair for her. The soft towel covered her slightly reddened eyes.

Gu Peijiu changed the subject, "Why are you afraid of Chu Yi?"

"I'm not afraid," Xia Ge replied.

Gu Peijiu made a sound of agreement and didn't argue with her. She chatted casually, "Then don't be afraid. I saw your jade on Ye Ze's hand."

Xia Ge stiffened.

"Why did you give him the jade?" Gu Peijiu asked directly, "Do you like him?"

"How is that possible? He lent it to me," Xia Ge felt embarrassed, "I returned it to him."

The girl's hair was very soft and black. Gu Peijiu helped her wipe away the water droplets on the ends of her hair. "So, you went to Jianfeng today to return the jade?"

Master Sister's movements were extremely gentle. The faint sandalwood scent spread out, and Xia Ge closed her eyes comfortably, "Yes..."

When she realized what she had just said, Xia Ge suddenly shuddered, "No, it's not true! I returned it to him yesterday! I didn't go to Jianfeng! It wasn't me!"

She was actually deceived by Master Sister's beauty!

Gu Peijiu made a sound of understanding, "I see."

Xia Ge: "..."

Gu Peijiu put away the towel, "It's dry now."
Xia Ge: "Thank you, Senior Sister."

"No need to thank me." After thinking for a moment, Gu Peiju decided to remind her, "I saw you yesterday."

"Ah?"

"You were wearing a jade pendant and had a doll with you yesterday," Gu Peiju stated. "Today, the doll is gone and the jade pendant is with Ye Ze."

Xia Ge's expression stiffened slightly.

After finishing her statement, Gu Peiju saw Xia Ge's expression shift slightly and suddenly smiled.

"It's okay."

"I believe everything you say."

Xia Ge: "..."

System: "..."

They had already reached this point, and hiding it seemed to have no meaning.

After a while, Xia Ge lowered her head dejectedly. "I went to Sword Peak."

"Mm."

She hesitated for a while and asked, "...Senior Sister, don't you think I'm a spy?"

Gu Peiju's voice was gentle. "As long as you say you're not."

"I'll believe you."

For a moment, Xia Ge had an indescribable feeling.

After a long time, Xia Ge said softly, "I'm not."

As long as you believe me.

= =
Fortunately, Senior Sister did not pursue the matter further and let her go after drying her hair.

On the way back, Xia Ge did not dare to look back. She always felt that Senior Sister was watching her from behind.

In fact, she was.

Xia Ge: "Xiao Kui... I feel like Senior Sister is acting a bit strange lately."

System: "Really?"

Xia Ge: "She seems very Buddhist-like."

System: "Otherwise, what should we do? Hang you up and torture you with the ten most cruel methods to force you to tell the truth?"

Xia Ge: "..."

System: "That's actually what we should do."

Xia Ge: "Can you tell me how you were uninstalled? I really want to know lately."

System: "See that parasol tree in front of you? Knock your head against it a hundred times, then shout 'Invincible Kui is my daddy' one million times, and I'll be uninstalled by you."

Xia Ge: "..."

System: "Actually, even if you tell her everything, it shouldn't matter, right?"

"But I can't be sure." Xia Ge suddenly felt a bit anxious. She casually picked up a piece of dogtail grass, rubbed its stem together, then opened it up again. "I know, I don't want to lie to her. I think it's not good to lie to her, but I really..."

She really couldn't be sure.

System: "Can't be sure about what?"

Or rather.

"What are you uneasy about?"

Xia Ge threw away the dogtail grass in her hand. "I don't know what she will do..."

"What will she do?"

"Don't you know best?"


Xia Ge pointed to herself and said, "Me? I know?"

The system replied, "You know."

Xia Ge said, "I don't know."

The system insisted, "You clearly know."

Xia Ge replied, "I only know that I won't be hungry if I eat today. I can't guess other people's thoughts."

The system asked, "If you were to jump off a cliff, and your senior sister was next to you, what do you think she would do?"

Xia Ge instinctively replied, "She would save me."

The system said, "You see, you do know."

Xia Ge rolled her eyes and said, "Your example is not very appropriate. Anyone would save someone who jumps off a cliff. If it were me, I wouldn't just watch someone fall."

The system replied, "But you see, you do know."

Xia Ge was taken aback.

The system continued, "If it were her, how could she just watch you fall?"
