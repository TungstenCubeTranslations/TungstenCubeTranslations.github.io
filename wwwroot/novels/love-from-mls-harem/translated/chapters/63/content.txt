Xia Ge immediately took the gourd and opened the lid to pour water down her throat. She gulped down the piece of baked cake, but because she was too hasty, she almost choked and felt like she had just passed through the gates of hell. She was in excruciating pain. The person next to her who handed her the water advised her, "Drink slowly...drink slowly..."

"Thank...thank you." Xia Ge gasped for breath and returned the gourd to the other person. The other person laughed and said with a hint of pride, "Little brother, were you scared by what I just said? Ha, even the heavens couldn't stand it and you can see that they are receiving retribution, right?"

Xia "Heavenly God" Ge felt guilty and said, "Ha, ha ha...probably."

Yesterday, she kicked a few tiles, but why did it spread so quickly and the next day the council hall was demolished by the Heavenly God?

Okay, it wasn't just a few tiles. When Chu Yao took her away, she looked from afar and it seemed like she had lost a lot of hair.

Yesterday, Chu Yao spared her...but she didn't know how they dealt with it on Sword Peak.

Xia Ge was lost in thought when she heard someone next to her hum, "Deserved it! They grow eyes on top of their heads and bully people everywhere. Shameless!"

The person who handed her the gourd was a young man wearing linen clothes. He seemed very melancholy and sighed, "Ah...if it wasn't for the fact that no one in our Dan Peak can refine earth-level elixirs, we wouldn't be so bullied..."

Xia Ge said, "Earth-level elixirs?"

She mainly read from the perspective of the male lead in the book "Endless Wind and Moon". She followed the male lead, who went to Sword Peak, so most of the descriptions were about Sword Peak. However, Dan Peak was a stepping stone for the male lead to Sword Peak. The male lead's main cultivation was swordsmanship, and alchemy was his weakness. Therefore, there were few descriptions of Dan Peak.

In addition, for the past few years, as an outer disciple, she lived a carefree life of eating, drinking, and playing. Besides being punished to copy the Dan Peak Eight Classics when she made mistakes, she only knew some common sense things such as "avoiding Sword Peak disciples" and "being able to enter the inner gate by refining the Pigu elixir". She knew very little about other more detailed content about Dan Peak, such as why Dan Peak's status was so low.

"Yes..." the young man holding the gourd sighed, seeming regretful. "My father told me that Dan Peak used to be very powerful. There were a lot of earth-level and above alchemists, and Dan Peak was particularly respected at that time. At that time, Dan Peak was similar to Sword Peak, and only people with high status would come to learn alchemy, which is completely different from now..."

Someone next to him agreed.

"But later, I don't know what happened..." the young man holding the gourd continued, "Refining elixirs requires refining veins, but the Dan Peak library had a fire and burned all the earth-level and above elixir recipes and vein cultivation techniques. Because they were secret books that were only allowed to be seen by high-ranking inner disciples and were not allowed to be copied, that fire really..."

Xia Ge silently added to his words--

It really burned Dan Peak's future.

He didn't say anything more, but his expression was full of regret.

"Since then, Dan Peak hasn't produced any alchemists above earth-level." Someone next to him added, "Later, the standards for accepting inner disciples at Dan Peak have been lowered repeatedly, and now it has become what it is today...as long as you can refine a Pigu elixir, you can get in. Ha...what rules...but it's also good."

"Now, profound-level elixirs are everywhere. Learning alchemy at Dan Peak is just hoping to learn how to make a living in the future."

In his tone, it was unclear whether he was regretful for Dan Peak or grateful for himself.

Someone next to him sighed, "No wonder they are looked down upon everywhere."
"Ha ha, don't even bother. Even if the mystical-grade pill is everywhere, you still can't refine it."

"Shame on you, always talking too much."

Regarding the conversation above, Xia Ge didn't express any feelings. After finishing the last bite of the baked cake, she still felt a little thirsty but didn't bring any water. Although she had thick skin, it wasn't appropriate to ask for water from others again. She rolled up the oil paper wrapper of the baked cake and looked at the sea of people across from her. She decided to go back and find some water to drink first and wait for the crowd to disperse.

System: "Host, I have decided to tell you some good news."

Xia Ge was thinking about where to find water nearby and responded with a "Hmm?"

System: "You previously activated the 'Alchemist' profession, right?"

It seemed that the system thought this was good news that Xia Ge should feel very happy about. There was a hint of teasing in the system's words.

"Yes."

Because there were too many things happening, and Xia Ge's enthusiasm for alchemy was lacking, even though she suddenly had an alchemist panel, she didn't look at it carefully.

"So, you now have the default system 'Danmai'! Currently, your Danmai is 'Yellow' grade. As long as you refine a certain amount of different 'Yellow-grade pills,' you can upgrade it by increasing your proficiency. This method completely eliminates the bottleneck of the 'Earth-grade'!"

Still thirsty, Xia Ge wanted to drink some water.

The system thought Xia Ge should be excited: "Are you excited? Happy?"

...Forget it, although she didn't like alchemy very much, she still decided to take a look. Maybe it would be useful.

Xia Ge silently opened the panel.

"Alchemist

Level (Danmai): Yellow

Proficiency: 1/10

Known pill formulas: {Fasting Pill}

Pill formula store: [Not yet opened]

Dan furnace: [None]

Dan technique: Gathering Spirit Technique (Ancient Â· Simple)."
Xia Ge was a little interested, but looking at the column of Dan Fang, she felt a little strange: "Different types of elixirs, it's easy to find yellow-level ones, and even Xuan-level ones can be found within the inner door, but how do you refine earth-level ones? In the end, it's the same as everyone else, without the Dan Fang."

It sounded as easy as eating a meal.

Oh, by the way, it's not easy for her to eat now either.

The system really painted a big picture for her, talking without considering the consequences.

System: "This is simple! Have you seen the Dan Fang shop? When you reach Xuan-level, you will unlock the Dan Fang branch shop. Complete the branch tasks in the Dan Fang shop, and you can get Dan Fangs above Xuan-level!"

Xia Ge: "What does that mean?"

System: "It means that you might be the only one in Dan Peak and possibly become a heavenly-level alchemist!"

...Oh, that's amazing. Still, she wants to drink water.

The system saw that Xia Ge lacked enthusiasm and racked its brains, finally coming up with the most exciting words:

"When you become a heavenly-level alchemist, you will be the richest person in the world!!! Everyone will ask you for medicine, everyone will kneel down and call you daddy! By then, the elixirs you refine will be priceless! Isn't that exciting? Are you happy?"

Xia Ge: "..."

It seems like the promotional language of a computer junk game that she accidentally clicked on before, starting with one million gold coins.

But...if she could really become a heavenly-level alchemist, she could really walk sideways, right? Hmm, thinking about it, she's a little excited.

"Hey - Xia Wuyin?"

Xia Ge just turned her head when a clear voice of a girl suddenly came from behind her, "Are you also here to check the results?"

This female voice seemed to have an extraordinary penetrating power. In the moment she shouted out that name, it seemed that everyone who came to check the results quieted down for a second. The person next to her who lent her water also looked at her with an unbelievable expression, as if watching some strange creature.

Holding a fried cake in oil paper, Xia Ge, who always adhered to a low-key approach to life and a high-profile approach to action, once again experienced the feeling of being watched by everyone after her sudden appearance in the Dan training field.

"He...is that...Xia Wuyin?"

"Three Life Golden Elixir, truly a genius among young people!"

"..."
"Xia Wuyin, look over here! I'm here!"

Xia Ge, who looked confused, finally managed to spot the girl's figure in the sea of people. Mao Qing struggled to make her way out of the crowd and panted as she reached Xia Ge. "Are you here to check the results too?"

"Uh... yeah," Xia Ge replied.

She silently put down the rolled-up oil paper in her hand, covering it with her sleeve, and nodded.

"Don't bother looking," Mao Qing wiped the sweat off her forehead and hurriedly said, "I checked for you. Your name isn't on there."

Xia Ge was shocked. "What?!"

"I'm not lying to you, it's true," Mao Qing said. "I thought you would be first... but I was wrong. First place went to Huo Bai. He refined the Scarlet Blood Purgatory Pill."

"But I also find it strange," Mao Qing frowned, looking confused. "Your Three Lives Golden Pill should at least be in the top three, but I didn't see your name from the beginning to the end..."

Before Xia Ge could say anything, she heard a faint voice. "I looked at the rules. He exploded the furnace, so he didn't have a ranking."

Xia Ge looked over and saw Huo Bai.

This time, Huo Bai wore a white robe with wide sleeves, and the edges of the sleeves were dark blue. He wore black boots and a dark blue hairband on his head, and he had a white jade pendant with runes on it tied to his waist with a dark blue ribbon. He looked much more serious than before.

"I see... but he was still eliminated like that? That's the Three Lives Golden Pill," Mao Qing said in disbelief as she looked at Xia Ge. Xia Ge scratched her head, not knowing how she felt.

Was she disappointed? Depressed? Not really. In the end, Xia Ge smiled and changed the subject, looking at Huo Bai's outfit. "Brother Huo, this outfit looks good on you."

Mao Qing, who had a lively personality, was also quickly distracted by Huo Bai's clothes. "Oh, this outfit is nice. Do you know you got first place?"

Huo Bai's face darkened, obviously unhappy. "I wear what I want to wear. You're such a gossip."

"Who are you calling a gossip?" Mao Qing joked, but she suddenly became angry and rolled up her sleeves, ready to scold him. "I may be a gossip, but I'm still better than someone who secretly eats candy and won't admit it!"

Huo Bai turned pale, apparently also upset. Xia Ge saw that the two were about to fight over a trivial topic like clothes, so she quickly pulled their sleeves and acted as a peacemaker. "Hey, hey, let's talk nicely. It's not fun to argue like this. Harmony brings wealth, harmony brings wealth..."

"Hmph," Mao Qing puffed out her cheeks. "What's so great about being first place anyway?"

"Although being first place isn't really that great, some stupid people can study for a lifetime and still not be able to achieve it," Huo Bai sneered.

"Who are you calling stupid?!" Mao Qing glared at him.

She really wanted to hit someone this time. Xia Ge almost failed to hold her back, but then a clear voice rang out from the northern stands -
"Quiet!"
