Not knowing exhaustion, only knowing how to fight.

Xia Ge felt like she had become a puppet.

Soul-snatching and soul-stealing were useless against Array Puppets, because they had no souls. Even if they were demonized, it only enhanced their physical abilities.

They were completely "mechanical."

So, to deal with them, aside from cutting off the spiritual energy supply outside the formation, one could only fight them to the death and exhaust their spiritual power.

She wasn't tired.

"...Host, you've been fighting them for a whole day!"

The system was anxious, "Too many!!"

Xia Ge didn't feel tired at all.

With the Scarlet Blood Refining Pill, she felt like a machine that had been fully wound up, filled with chicken blood, and in an incredible peak state. Not tired, but very annoyed.

Although she had cut off the spiritual energy supply to the formation under them, the previous violent spiritual energy fluctuations had already given them enough power, and the black vines were still laced with poison. Whenever she tried to cut the Night Pearl on the wall, countless vines and puppets would rush up to protect it.

She was very anxious.

Extremely anxious.

A-chan was poisoned, and she didn't know if she was alive or dead, but she couldn't save her and could only fight them head-on.

"...I have to...break through."

After fiercely cutting off the head of a puppet that charged towards her, Xia Ge leaped into the air and kicked over another puppet that pounced on her from behind. Taking advantage of the momentum, countless black vines attacked her from mid-air, attempting to block her movements--

Xia Ge understood very well that she couldn't be poisoned or injured.

Only by maintaining this peak state, not being poisoned or injured, could she have a slight hope of winning against so many puppets. If she were poisoned, then--

Puppets wouldn't get tired, and she was only barely able to reach this peak state with the Scarlet Blood Refining Pill, and it only lasted for three days.

If she were poisoned, then whether it was A-chan or her, they could only wait for death.

So, the tactics she had been using all along were foolproof, killing the most enemies in a situation where she wouldn't be hurt.
However, this way, the speed is really too slow.

She can kill many puppet formations like this, but it takes time and effort, and those black, poisoned vines are constantly blocking her from getting close to Achan and Yemingzhu, making it impossible for her to move forward.

She still has... one day left.

She has already killed most of the puppets below, maybe she can take a chance!

Xia Ge looked at the vines that were blocking her, and a sharp light flashed in her eyes. She chose to go forward instead of retreating!

The system was shocked, "Host! What are you doing? It's poisonous, retreat quickly!!!"

Xia Ge ignored the warning and at the moment when the sharp vine was about to pierce her body, the black sickle instantly drew out a pure black light, silently carrying a rolling killing intent.

"Stab--"

The vine shattered into countless pieces in the blink of an eye, and the system suddenly choked--what a fast knife!

However, in the next second, Xia Ge's night clothes were instantly shattered into countless pieces, and black cloth scraps and vine fragments flew around. Under the black shattered clothes was a snow-white undergarment. Countless fine scratches, hooked out by the vines, appeared on Xia Ge's slender arms and shoulders!

"...Little puppet." Xia Ge lightly tapped on the head of the puppet beneath her feet, and then suddenly exerted force and rushed towards the direction of the night pearls on the four walls! Countless vines rushed towards her again, and Xia Ge used the same technique, every strike lethal. However, she was in a state of fighting to the death!

"Host!!!"

The system's voice was sharp, "You will be poisoned like this, you will die!!!"

"...No pain, no gain."

The black sickle danced deadly arcs in the air, and Xia Ge's voice was hoarse amidst the wailing of the puppets, "Sometimes...I don't like to leave myself a way out."

Right now, outside, the entry-level competition of the Sword Peak is being held.

And tomorrow is the entry-level competition of the Pill Peak.

Although she said she didn't want to leave herself a way out, in fact, she had no way out.

She gave Achan the Bi Gu Gold Pill that can last for a year, and left herself with only the Red Blood Bi Gu Pill that can last for three days.

The system suddenly reacted, a little too late.
- This person has always been very clear-headed.
- Being clear-headed is a bit scary.
- And she has always been very clear-headed about knowing that the competition is about to begin and she will not have any more time.
- The reason she unhesitatingly gave the Golden Pill to Achan is because she knew that this pill would have no meaning other than making herself weak and retreat.
- "Shua-" The tightly bound vines were torn apart by Xia Ge's reckless attack, and the sharp sickle wind swept across the night pearl that was shining on the wall. The sound of the night pearl breaking was clattering. The black vines had a moment of shrinking, and Xia Ge took the opportunity to rush towards Achan!
- Her voice was hoarse, "Xiao Kui, the Black Vine Poison will only paralyze after three hours - that's enough!!"
- "What about afterwards? And you exercising vigorously now will accelerate the spread of the toxin! You still have to participate in the competition!" The system was going crazy, "Do you have a brain!!!"
- "Xiao Kui, if I can't even do the first step well."
- The sharp sickle wind suddenly shattered the vines around Achan, and the black-clothed shattered boy showed a girl's posture for the first time. Her black hair was flying, the sickle wind was sharp, and she held Achan with her right arm holding the sickle. She was about to exert force again, but suddenly her whole body trembled!
- The paralysis came suddenly.
- Xia Ge's pupils shrank slightly. She stepped on empty space and was about to fall from mid-air like a broken-winged kite--
- The wind was blowing--
- Xia Ge muttered, "Then how do I think about the second step."
- Do the best she can do now and never give up any possibility.
- Achan closed her eyes, feeling the slender arm holding her tightly and the hoarse voice of the boy in her ear.
- He said, "That's enough."
- The feeling of paralysis passed, and Xia Ge suddenly stepped on the head of the roaring puppet below. She opened the point mall at the fastest speed and quickly found what she wanted!
- [Potential Gun].
- Su Chan slightly opened her eyes and looked at the boy in front of her. The torn clothes revealed the boy's fair neck and delicate collarbone. The vines on her body were not completely removed, and the sharp thorns of the broken vines pierced into the boy's body, bringing out a hint of sweet blood. 
- It's a very sweet...blood taste.
And... the bones of this young man.

The pure black pupils of Su Chan reflected the flowing light of shattered night pearls, giving off a slightly dangerous feeling.

This young man... seems to be a little girl.

However, Xia Ge was completely unaware of this. All of her attention was focused on the B-level puppet guarding the platform!

Success or failure, all depends on this moment.

[Warning!! Unable to defeat!!! Retreat quickly!!!]

The overwhelming vines attacked again. Xia Ge, holding the sickle in one hand and hugging Su Chan with the other, was completely unprepared for the vines coming towards her. Ignoring the blood-red warning from the system, Xia Ge suddenly hugged the red-clothed girl tightly, protecting her in her arms. She turned around and faced the vines, retreating towards the platform without hesitation!

Holding the sickle in her right hand and the girl in her left, Xia Ge skillfully turned the potential gun in her hand and then pulled the trigger towards herself!

"Bang-"

[Potential Gun] 10 points

Effect: After being hit, it will quickly burst out a huge potential for one minute.

In the midst of intense pain, there was a strong power! Xia Ge felt like she was burning, and all her blood was burning!

"...Trust me."

Su Chan lifted her head in the thin girl's embrace, and her eyes met hers.

Those black pupils burned with flames that Su Chan had never seen before.

Passion, anger, confidence, a desperate gamble, and... the tenderness that she had only seen in one person's eyes since she was born into this world.

She looked at her black clothes torn by the vines, the smooth curve of her neck from her chin to her collarbone, and the thin embrace that could give so much warmth and disbelief.

Su Chan thought.

Clearly, she was just a thin... girl.

"Trust me--"

Su Chan heard her hoarse voice in the wind, "I... will definitely save you!"
Unprepared, Su Chan's back was torn by vines. She looked at the pure black pupils burning with flames, which slightly shrank due to pain. The blood mist filled the air, but the hand that held her did not loosen, tightly holding her.

In the midst of the vines, she did not receive any harm.

- These black, burning pupils can be so fascinating.

So reassuring.

So beautiful... it's intoxicating.

She smiled slightly, her pale face like a charming flower. Her voice carried a low, but slightly seductive lingering.

Unexpectedly, as the leader of the Qianhun Sect, she could find a sense of peace from a child.

... it's not bad.

She heard herself say.

"Well, I believe you... my hero."

- Let her see what this child can do.

Xia Ge was no longer concerned about the strange voice and smile of the person in her arms. Although her back was in severe pain, the potential gun made her feel full of endless power!

- This tactic of hurting the enemy while also hurting oneself has always been considered the stupidest by her, but she has no other choice now.

The potential gun only had one minute.

She must kill that B-grade puppet and get the teleportation stone out within this minute!

Breaking through the dense vines, her vision suddenly became clear. The glass B-grade puppet raised its head and met her gaze!

Xia Ge suddenly threw the used potential gun in her hand towards its head, and a green light flashed in her eyes -

[One hit, guaranteed to hit]!

With a loud bang, the thrown potential gun carried a huge aura and smashed the head of the glass puppet that wanted to dodge. Countless low-level puppet formations rushed over. Xia Ge flipped her hand and threw the sickle in her right hand to her left hand. "Clang clang clang," three sounds, and the straight sickle suddenly broke into three pieces, and then she threw it towards the B-grade puppet that was caught off guard because its head was smashed open!

"Stab -"

"One hit, guaranteed to hit -"
Su Chan heard the hoarse whisper of the young girl.

At the forefront, the sharp sickle suddenly brought a terrifying aura when it was thrown by the young girl. Wherever it went, the puppets shattered and no one could resist!

"Chi--"

The sharp sickle cut the glass puppet in half! The teleportation rune stone placed in the puppet's abdomen also flew out due to the violent vibration!

"Clang clang clang--"

The sickle returned to its original state. Xia Ge held Su Chan in his right hand, clenched the sickle in his left hand, and one minute had not passed. Xia Ge stared at the flying rune stone tightly, wanting to put the sickle back into the Flowing Silver Ring, freeing his hand to grab the rune stone. However, Flowing Silver did not respond.

Malfunction?!

Xia Ge's pupils shrank slightly!

[Flowing Silver]: Occasionally, there may be a malfunction in accessing items.

At this time!

"Roar--" A puppet spraying mist suddenly rushed into the air beside her and pounced on her. Xia Ge threw the sickle in her hand, and the sickle turned into a spin in the air, directly cutting off the head of the puppet spraying mist! Xia Ge didn't care about the sickle that was thrown out. She suddenly activated Ghost Shadow Step, stepped on the puppet's head in mid-air, and rushed towards the teleportation rune stone!

She had to get the teleportation rune stone!

However, just as Xia Ge's empty hand was about to touch the stone--

Her body suddenly froze completely.

One minute had just passed since the Potential Spear was activated, and coupled with the intense exercise just now, the toxin of the Black Vine spread even faster, so--

The rune stone flew past her fingertips.

...Missed.

Failed.

- If Flowing Silver hadn't malfunctioned just now.
- If she hadn't thought of putting the sickle into the flowing silver just a second ago, and instead threw it away and took the talisman.

- Regardless, now she's one move away from losing the game...and losing everything.

- She felt unwilling.

- So unwilling!!!

- Xia Ge was lost in thought and almost fell like a kite with broken wings.

- A sound of wind.

- "Young master went through so much trouble to save me."

- The voice of the girl in his arms was beautiful and charming, with a hint of coquettishness.

- "Ah Chan is grateful in her heart."

- Feeling the stiffness and weakness of the thin arm holding her, Su Chan looked at the slightly hollow eyes of the girl in her arms and smiled softly.

- Just when Xia Ge felt hopeless, a hand as delicate as jade hooked onto the teleportation talisman for him.

- Xia Ge widened his eyes slightly.

- In mid-air, the girl in red held the teleportation stone and hugged Xia Ge, who was stiff all over.

- "Don't cry, my little hero."

- The girl's voice was no longer as gentle and mature as before, but rather seductive and hoarse. She gently reached out and lifted Xia Ge's chin, her forehead adorned with a golden hairpin, her eyes slanted, unforgettable and seductive.

- She praised softly, "You're already very strong."

- The stiff body was suddenly embraced, and the red clothes fluttered into a beautiful phantom in front of Xia Ge's eyes. The girl who was dying on the black vines had turned into a bewitching demon in a blink of an eye. She smiled gently, like a dream.

- "..."

- The two fell to the ground together, and all the puppets below rushed over recklessly. However, the demon who caused chaos and disaster just smiled lightly, as if throwing away a piece of garbage, casually waving the sleeve torn by her. 

- The night pearls on the wall blinked and shattered into countless pieces with a "crackling" sound. The black vines disappeared completely, and the puppets about to pounce on the ground turned into ashes in the blink of an eye. The huge stone room suddenly became extremely spacious, with only the golden formation on the ground still shining brightly, illuminating everything.
Clear and pure, everything just now seemed like a dream.

Her gentle laughter was accompanied by a captivating charm.

"You, my dear, are truly a lovable little girl."
