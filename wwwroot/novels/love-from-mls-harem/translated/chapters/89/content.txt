Chu Yao asked, "What did you do to offend him?"

Xia Ge replied, "Who offended him? Don't worry about it. He's just crazy."

Chu Yao raised an eyebrow and asked, "You're just leaving him here?"

Xia Ge rolled her eyes and pushed her with one hand while holding the wine with the other. "Should I have taken him to see a doctor?"

Chu Yao thought for a moment and said, "I thought you might actually do that."

Xia Ge replied, "..."

She was not a saint, she was just trying to be helpful.

Chu Yao couldn't help but laugh when she saw Xia Ge's expression. "It's okay. Let's go."

The two of them threw the unconscious Huo Bai, who had been hit by a wine jar, into the woods and left.

"Why did you come to find me?" Xia Ge asked as she held the wine. "And you brought two jars of wine...what a waste."

She felt regretful thinking about the expensive bamboo leaf green from Dongqing Restaurant.

"Do I have to have a reason to come find you?" Chu Yao raised an eyebrow.

"I don't know if you have a reason or not..." Xia Ge replied honestly. "But I do know an old saying."

Chu Yao asked, "What is it?"

Xia Ge held the wine tightly and said with conviction, "If someone is overly attentive without reason, they must have ulterior motives."

Chu Yao clicked her tongue and looked at Xia Ge. Her eyebrows raised slightly and a hint of a smile appeared on her lips. "So, you accepted the attention, but you think I have ulterior motives? That's not very nice, is it?"

Xia Ge hugged the wine jar tightly and said firmly, "I didn't accept it. I'm just holding it for you!"

"Hmm..." Chu Yao stroked her chin and seemed to be thinking. After a while, she smiled faintly and said, "So, you're saying that I didn't show enough attention?"

After saying that, Chu Yao grabbed Xia Ge's collar and disappeared into the woods like a ghost.

"Hey, hey, hey!"
The wind was howling, and Chu Yao was moving at an incredible speed. Xia Ge tightly held onto the wine jug, which was shaking in her hand as she shouted, "Stop! I still have classes to attend! The teacher will scold me if I'm late!"

Chu Yao leapt lightly onto a branch, as agile as a swallow. She laughed and said, "Do you really need to attend class? Why not let me teach you instead?"

Xia Ge was feeling dizzy from holding onto the wine jug. "What can you teach me? No, who said you could teach me anything? I'll get scolded by the teacher!"

Chu Yao let out a small "oh." "Don't worry, you get scolded by the teacher all the time."

Xia Ge was speechless. "What? Who told you that? I'm excellent!"

Chu Yao replied, "It's okay. Let me get scolded once for your sake."

Xia Ge steadied herself and accepted reality. "What do you want to teach me?"

Chu Yao brought Xia Ge to the top of a mountain. The wind was blowing, and the forest was dense. Chu Yao put Xia Ge down and rubbed her chin. "I can teach you how to shoot a bow and arrow."

Xia Ge was speechless. She quickly grabbed the wine jug and headed back.

Chu Yao grabbed Xia Ge's collar. "Where are you going?"

Xia Ge was in tears. "I don't want to learn how to shoot a bow and arrow."

Chu Yao said, "But I'm trying to impress you."

Xia Ge thought to herself, "Why does impressing someone involve shooting a bow and arrow? Don't you think there's something wrong with your logic? A jug of wine is enough to impress me. And why did you suddenly want to impress me?"

Xia Ge held onto the wine jug and hinted subtly, "This wine is actually quite good."

Chu Yao said, "Wait here for me."

Xia Ge watched as Chu Yao leapt onto a tree and took out two bows and a quiver of arrows from a bird's nest. Chu Yao then leapt down with a few graceful jumps and threw a bow and quiver to Xia Ge. "Let's continue."
Xia Ge held a wine jar in one hand and a bow and arrow bag in the other. "Huh?" 

Chu Yao said, "We need to hide the wine and then go hunting." 

Xia Ge asked, "Where should we hide it?" Hunting? 

Just go hunting, why talk about bending the bow to shoot the great eagle? Does that make us look cultured? 

Chu Yao thought for a moment and said, "Follow me." 

They were now in a dense forest. Chu Yao led her through twists and turns, and Xia Ge felt a sense of familiarity. She turned her head and saw a persimmon grove not far away. 

Xia Ge paused for a moment and said, "The persimmons over there are ripe." 

Chu Yao asked, "Do you want to eat them?" 

Xia Ge asked knowingly, "Are they astringent?" She had eaten them before and they were not astringent at all, but very sweet. 

Chu Yao said, "They're not astringent." 

After picking two, Xia Ge put them on the wine jar and carried the jar and persimmons while holding her bow and arrow. She continued to follow Chu Yao. 

After a few twists and turns, Chu Yao finally found a tree hole and said, "Hmm, let's hide it here." 

Xia Ge put the wine jar inside and covered it with leaves. She clapped her hands and stood up with her bow, suddenly laughing. "Why does it feel like we're burying a bottle of Huadiao wine?" 

Chu Yao paused for a moment and looked at her sideways. "Huadiao wine?" 

Xia Ge exclaimed, "Don't you know? When a daughter is born, people bury a bottle of Niangao wine. When the daughter gets married, they open it and drink it." 

"I know," Chu Yao said. "But why do you feel like we're burying Huadiao wine?" 

Xia Ge was speechless.
"It's just a feeling, there's no reason for it," Xia Ge changed the subject and couldn't help but smile mischievously, "But since you're the daughter of the Chu family, a prominent family, you must have some good wine, right?"

"Who knows," Chu Yao clicked her tongue and found it amusing, "Do you want to drink some?"

"Um, no, no, I was just asking," Xia Ge waved her hand and sighed, "I just think this tradition is quite interesting."

"Uninteresting," Chu Yao said, "Hide it and let's go. Come back tonight."

"Ah? Tonight too? Master will really scold me..." 

But since she was already there, getting scolded was inevitable. Xia Ge muttered a few words but didn't say anything more.

Actually, she didn't really care about being scolded or not. She was just following Chu Yao and, coupled with what happened earlier, saying "afraid of being scolded by Master" was just her way of covering up her guilt.

But seeing that the other party didn't bring it up at all, Xia Ge played dumb. She carried her bow and arrows and followed Chu Yao, "What are we going to hunt?"

Chu Yao rubbed her chin, squinted her eyes, looked at the broken sunlight filtering through the overlapping leaves above, faintly heard birds chirping, and finally lightly jumped onto the treetop.

The scenery was beautiful, the sky was clear, and it was a good day for hunting.

Xia Ge couldn't help but look up, but could only see the blue hem of the other party's clothes.

Chu Yao said, "Come up."

Xia Ge activated her Ghost Shadow Trace, carried her bow, and jumped up a few times, landing lightly on a branch on the top. As soon as she looked up, she saw the blue hairband of the girl fluttering with her black hair, the bowstring taut, the sharp arrow pointing straight to the sky, and her black eyes reflecting a sharp light.

"Swish--"

Xia Ge looked up and saw the arrow pierce through the air, accompanied by a mournful cry. She then saw a large goose fall from the "one" character pointing south.

Xia Ge: "..."

Chu Yao's figure flashed, and the next moment, she was holding a dead goose in her hand. The sharp long arrow pierced through the chest of the goose, killing it in one shot.

Chu Yao said, "We'll roast the goose tonight."

Xia Ge: "..."

Seeing Xia Ge's expression, Chu Yao raised an eyebrow slightly, "Didn't you say you wanted to roast a goose last time?"

Xia Ge's expression drifted, "I don't remember." She was just talking.
Chu Yao said, "I can do it."

"Hurry up, don't be lazy. Today's dinner depends on this," Chu Yao said. Seeing Xia Ge not moving, she looked at her with a hint of suspicion. "You're not going to tell me that you can't even pull a bowstring, are you?"

Xia Ge smiled awkwardly. "Of course not."

After saying that, she imitated Chu Yao's action of bending the bow and placing an arrow. The sky had geese flying over, but Xia Ge didn't dare to use her full strength and accuracy while being watched by Chu Yao. As the bowstring was released from her fingertips, the long arrow shot out with incredible speed.

"I pulled the bow," Xia Ge said proudly.

Chu Yao watched as the arrow flew through the air with incredible speed and then gracefully arced down in a parabolic path. It landed gently on a mountain, and a row of geese flew over, turning into a black dot in the sky in the blink of an eye.

Chu Yao was speechless for a moment and asked, "You really haven't done this before?"

Xia Ge said, "This is my first time using a bow...wait for me to get a feel for it."

Xia Ge rubbed the bowstring and took out a feathered arrow from behind her back. She slowly brought out the feeling of being able to hit her target with one shot. After opening her spiritual senses, she always felt more sensitive to changes in spiritual energy in the outside world. Xia Ge pinched the feather tail of the arrow and vaguely felt that the spiritual energy of the Sword Peak was not right.

Chu Yao was carrying a goose and seemed to have noticed nothing, just watching Xia Ge with the arrow.

Xia Ge said, "I think I've got the hang of it..."

"Squeak, squeak!"

Before Xia Ge could finish her sentence, countless unpleasant squeaking sounds suddenly resounded from all around them. It was so piercing and arrogant that in the next moment, the sky that was originally bright suddenly became dark, as if covered by a black cloud!

Countless squeaking sounds mixed together, making people dizzy. Xia Ge's pupils shrank slightly, and she saw what was above her head clearly!

It wasn't a black cloud, it was...bats!

Countless half-human-sized giant black bats appeared out of nowhere and instantly occupied the high ground of the Lingxi Sword Peak!

Xia Ge and Chu Yao stood on the top of a tall tree and immediately became targets without hesitation. Countless black bats swooped down towards the two of them, and their wings were like poisonous blades. Wherever they went, the lush vegetation withered and faded in an instant, making the scene extremely eerie!

Chu Yao held a goose in one hand, carried a longbow and quiver on her back, and drew a long sword from her waist with the other hand. The sword flashed with a bright light in the darkness!

"Chirp!"

With one sword strike, the bat that flew towards them was cut in half from head to toe! In an instant, blood spurted out, making the scene extremely terrifying!
The bat realized that Chu Yao was a tough nut to crack and turned to rush towards Xia Ge. Chu Yao, without hesitation, held her sword and went towards Xia Ge. But as she lifted her head, she saw a young man holding a bow and arrow in the midst of a bloody rain. The black wind was bleak, and his black and red hair fluttered in the wind. The tip of the arrow in his hand was condensed with coldness. Through the countless attacks of the giant bats flying towards him, the arrow was aimed straight towards her direction!
