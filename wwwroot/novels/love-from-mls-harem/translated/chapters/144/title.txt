Chapter 143: What's the Reason

The protagonist was sitting alone in his room, deep in thought. He had been pondering over the events that had led him to this point. What was the reason for all of this? Why had he been chosen to go on this journey?

As a translator, I couldn't help but feel the same way. Why was I chosen to translate this novel? What was the reason behind it all? Perhaps it was fate, or maybe it was just chance. Whatever the reason, I knew that I had to do my best to bring this story to life for English-speaking readers.

With that in mind, I continued my work, carefully translating each word and sentence. It was a challenging task, but I was determined to see it through to the end. After all, I knew that this story had the power to touch people's hearts and change their lives.

As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the protagonist and his journey. Like him, I was on a journey of my own. And just like him, I knew that the path ahead would be filled with challenges and obstacles. But I was ready to face them head-on, knowing that the reward at the end would be worth it.

And so I continued to translate, word by word, sentence by sentence. With each passing chapter, I felt more and more connected to the story and the characters. It was as if I was living their lives alongside them, experiencing their joys and sorrows.

As I finished translating Chapter 143, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. It was a small victory, but it was a victory nonetheless. And with that, I knew that I was one step closer to completing my own journey as a translator.
