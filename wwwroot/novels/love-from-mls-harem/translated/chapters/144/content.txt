After leaving the persimmon forest, the young man's footsteps were slow and steady at first. But as he walked on, he began to run, stumbling forward and suddenly tripping over a rock. He fell to the ground with a thud, and his sword, the Wengqing, was flung to the side.

He was in a sorry state.

The Ghost Dragon Jade began to emit a faint light, and black mist slowly emanated from the young man's body. The Ghost Dragon's reddish-golden dragon eyes stared at the young man, recalling everything it had just seen. It felt that something was not right with this young man and after a while, it asked, "Why are you so impulsive?"

Yezhe lay on the ground, slowly covering his face with his hands. Warm tears flowed slowly from his eyes.

"He..."

The mist from the Ghost Dragon wrapped around the young man's body. "What are you running away from?" it asked.

Yezhe turned over and lay flat on the ground, his tears still wet on his cheeks. He stared blankly at the stars in the sky.

In fact, there was no need to take that step just now.

There was no need to be so ruthless.

But...

Yezhe trembled as he looked at his own hands.

The hands that had choked Xia Wuyin's neck before.

When he was wrestling with Xia Wuyin, he saw something in the Bai Meng acupoint and was unsure, so he deliberately brushed past "him" neck.

At that time, he did not touch the Adam's apple but was instead counterattacked by Xia Wuyin.

Because he was unsure...so-

But.

When he finally choked the life out of him.

There was no...Adam's apple.

Yezhe's body began to tremble slightly. He suddenly slapped himself in the face, covered his eyes, and said in a low voice, "He didn't... he didn't..."

Everything in the Bai Meng acupoint, the terrifying dream where the faces of the girl and "him" overlapped.
Ye Ze couldn't continue speaking. He felt that every word he said was a torture to himself, and it was a step closer to the bloody truth. Every single possibility seemed so grim and unacceptable. 

Therefore, he covered his face and thought of Xia Wuyin's incredulous gaze just now, feeling a suffocating pain in his chest. He was, in the end, cowardly. He couldn't accept that possibility, not even a little bit.

The "Prison Break" incident was resolved by Gu Peijiu using her connections.

Half a month later, in the mountain prison.

Qin Yue leaned against the stone wall, holding a bell in her hand. However, her mind was still filled with the cold gaze of the young man and the sword that was swung towards her but was blocked. She looked at the heavy black iron chain on her wrist, then shifted her gaze down to the bell in her hand.

Knock on demons...

Qin Yue closed her eyes and laughed at herself. She thought she wasn't afraid of death, but it seemed that she was. If it were in the past, she wouldn't have been afraid of that level of danger. But now...

That child was deliberately led to her for no reason. It must have been Su Chan's plan. He just wanted to force her.

Qin Yue stared at the bell for a while, then finally closed her eyes, as if she had given up.
...It doesn't matter.

She leaned against the stone wall, using the iron chain in her hand to knock on the wall - once, twice, three times.

After knocking, she waited quietly for a moment.

Soon, a swaying little red puppet climbed up the high iron window, grabbing the iron bars with its small hands and leaning down to look at Qin Yuelu, who was leaning against the wall. Its painted face showed a shallow smile.

"Have you made up your mind?"

The little puppet's voice was charming, and it was Su Chan.

Qin Yuelu's face showed no expression. "Yes, I have."

At the back of the mountain, the red-clad girl closed her eyes, stroking the bone flute, her mind immersed in the little puppet. Her lips curved slightly. "I like smart people."

Qin Yuelu said, "I don't believe you."

Su Chan chuckled softly. "But you..."

She paused, and her red lips lightly uttered four words.

"You fear death."

"In this world, who doesn't want to live and avoid death for no reason?" Qin Yuelu laughed at herself, clenching the bell and saying, "You promised me before, you have to keep your word."

"As long as you can give me what I want." Su Chan propped her chin up, and the little puppet on the iron window also sat down, lowering its head to look at Qin Yuelu. "Everything is not a problem."

Qin Yuelu closed her eyes, then opened them again. "Since you've gone to such lengths to dig me out of here, should I also show my appreciation?"

Su Chan made an indeterminate sound. "Oh?"

"The third drawing." Qin Yuelu slowly stood up, and the iron chain clanged as her tattered prison clothes swayed, gradually revealing the stone wall she had blocked.

On the wall, a palm-sized area was densely covered with complex spirit patterns and formations. Her gaze was solemn. "The south, ghost island."

At the back of the mountain, Su Chan suddenly opened her eyes, and her narrow pupils were sharp as a blade.
After Qin Yue finished speaking, she slowly wiped the formation diagram clean. The guards heard the noise and came to see, but they only saw a black shadow with a woman's head leaning against the wall, eyes closed, looking unspirited.

"Be honest," the guard scolded her and left.

After the guard left, Qin Yue opened her eyes and a cold, fierce light flickered in her black eyes.

The next day, the mountain prison was robbed. Jianfeng was shocked, but they tried to keep the news hidden as much as possible.

Three days later, the news leaked out and caused a commotion among the various sects.

When the news reached Xia Ge's ears, she was reading a book on formations during her alchemy class. As the youngest leader of Danfeng and a profound-level alchemist, her master had changed from being verbally abusive to turning a blind eye.

As she was reading, Mao Qing leisurely threw a paper ball at her.

The paper ball rolled on the table, making a rattling sound, but because it was loosely rolled, it came undone and a piece of almond candy rolled out.

Xia Ge recognized it as the new almond candy from Jinjiang Candy Shop.

Xia Ge glanced at Mao Qing.

Mao Qing smiled brightly and made a mouth gesture to show her the "new product". Then she pointed to the note, indicating that there were words on it.

Xia Ge looked at the candy, then at the smiling Mao Qing, and finally picked up the paper wrapped around the candy.

On the back of the candy wrapper were four words: "The Latest Gossip."

Xia Ge pursed her lips and flipped the paper over.

The content on the back of the paper made her feel uneasy.

"- The Jianfeng Mountain Prison has been robbed."

Eight words, each of which she recognized, but together, Xia Ge felt that the information was too much.
Translation:

Sword Peak Mountain Prison... Qin Yue!?

After class, Xia Ge placed a note on Mao Qing's desk, "How did you know?"

Mao Qing rested her chin on her hand, "Everyone knows about it. It's old news."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge immediately thought of Ye Ze.

-"Following the rules only leads to being crushed by them. Only by being unconventional can one win."

...No, it couldn't be him. Ye Ze is the male lead of the growth system, and it's impossible for him to quietly stage a jailbreak in just half a month. Besides, if it were him, he wouldn't have been able to stage a jailbreak. He's too impulsive, and killing on the spot would have been the most likely outcome.

Xia Ge asked Mao Qing, "Who staged the jailbreak?"

Mao Qing blinked, "I don't know."

Then she smirked, "You care a lot, don't you?"

Xia Ge clicked her tongue and casually brushed it off, "I'm the leader of Dan Feng, of course, I have to care."

"Oh, I see." Mao Qing tilted her head and looked at her, suddenly saying, "Are you still angry?"

Xia Ge: "What am I angry about?"

Mao Qing said, "I told Senior Sister about your love letter."

After a pause, she added, "Oops, it was an accident."

Xia Ge: "It's okay, I don't mind."

"That candy is my apology." Mao Qing smiled and rested her chin on her hand, "If you want to forgive me, you have to do it quickly, or you won't have a chance."

Xia Ge: "..."

Although she felt that something was wrong, Xia Ge still asked subconsciously, "Why won't I have a chance?"

"Because... um, I'm going on a long journey soon." Mao Qing said absent-mindedly, "A few days ago, while I was packing at home, I found a memento my mother left me... It said I had a distant relative in the south."

Xia Ge: "You're not staying at Dan Feng?"


Mao Qing glanced at her sideways and suddenly laughed, saying inexplicably, "I'm leaving here, shouldn't you be happy?"

Regarding Mao Qing, she had a bit of suspicion based on intuition, feeling that Mao Qing's reactions were a bit off, but when she probed before, Mao Qing's reactions were completely normal. Despite her doubts, half a month had passed and Mao Qing's reactions were still normal. Without concrete evidence, Xia Ge let it go, but out of instinct, she would occasionally probe quietly.

But...she couldn't find any evidence at all.

If it was the real Mao Qing, her probing seemed to be hurting her.

Xia Ge scratched her head. "How could I be happy? You've misunderstoodâ€”I didn't blame you for what happened before. When will you come back?"

"Maybe soon, in a few months," Mao Qing said nonchalantly. "Maybe slowly, in a few years, or...more than a decade."

Xia Ge said, "...you've become more and more joking lately."

Mao Qing curved her lips. "I think so too."

Xia Ge said, "Anyway, have a safe journey."

Mao Qing said, "Thank you for your good wishes."

Chang'an.

The ancestral hall of the Chu family.

Chu Yao looked at the tall figure in front of her.

Her father, Chu Zhan, the current head of the Chu family.

The Chu sword embroidered with a golden dragon hung quietly behind the ancestral tablets of the Chu family's ancestors, dim and without any radiance.

The two of them, one in front and one kneeling behind, faced the ancestral tablets of the Chu family's ancestors.

After a long time, Chu Zhan spoke.

"Do you know why I called you back?"

Chu Yao lowered her head. "Daughter didn't handle things well."

Chu Zhan said, "You know that's just an excuse."
"The evil ghost tide in Kuzhu Village is just an excuse for their incompetence."

Chu Yao lowered her head and spoke calmly, "I dare not speak rashly, Father."

Chu Zhan sighed lightly and looked at the spirit of Chu Dao, then spoke after a while, "You must have heard about the Chang family obtaining the Heavenly Glow."

Chu Yao replied with a sound.

"The Chang family has been increasingly hostile towards our Chu family, and now that they have obtained the ancient garment, they will become even more arrogant." Chu Zhan said.

Chu Yao replied, "They won't be arrogant for long."

Chu Zhan shook his head and remained silent.

Chu Yao frowned slightly and asked, "Father?"

Does their Chu family, with a century-old foundation, have to fear a small family that is just starting out and wielding power recklessly?

"This garment has protected our clan's prosperity for five hundred years." Chu Zhan did not answer her question, only looked at the spirit of Chu Dao and murmured, "But in those five hundred years, no one from our clan has been able to make it submit."

Chu Yao was slightly startled.

"It can only intimidate, not go to war." Chu Zhan sighed, "Do you know why?"

Chu Yao replied, "Because the spirit recognizes its master, and no one besides the Chu king can..."

"No." Chu Zhan interrupted her.

Chu Yao was surprised.

"Recognizing a master is just a saying for you all." Chu Zhan said, "You're about the same age as you should start learning about some of the Chu family's affairs. Some things naturally have to be told to you."

Chu Yao listened respectfully.

However, at the moment she heard the content, she immediately raised her head and almost thought she had misheard - her father said.

"The spirit of Chu Dao..."
"Originally, it was the wedding dress made by the Chu King for himself."

On a cold and dark night, Chu Yao stared at the white dress with only a vivid golden dragon Chu sword for offering to the spirits. She couldn't believe that this dress, which looked like mourning clothes, was the wedding dress made by the Chu King for himself.

"So?" Chu Yao's voice was somewhat strained.

Chu Zhan also looked at the dress behind the tablet, his gaze somewhat complicated. "So, it may be waiting."

Waiting for what?

Chu Zhan didn't finish his words, and Chu Yao didn't ask either.

But she vaguely knew what her father wanted to say.

He may want to say...

This dress is waiting for a reason.

A reason to see the light of day again.

Perhaps this reason has nothing to do with the teachings left by the Chu King who committed suicide five hundred years ago, nor with the ups and downs of this family over the past five hundred years.

The person is gone, but the dress remains.

Chu Zhan turned around and left the hall, his voice calm. "Don't go back to Lingxi Peak for now. Follow me and start handling the family affairs tomorrow."

"Yes."
