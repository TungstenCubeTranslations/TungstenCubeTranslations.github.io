Chapter 122: Little Tsundere 

(Note: "病娇" is a term in Chinese internet slang that refers to a character who is cute and lovable but also prone to being clingy and demanding.)

As soon as Su Chenxi walked into the classroom, she saw Xiaoyu sitting in her seat with a gloomy expression on her face. 

Su Chenxi walked over and asked, "Xiaoyu, what's wrong? Why do you look so unhappy?" 

Xiaoyu pouted and said, "It's nothing. I'm just a little upset." 

Su Chenxi knew that Xiaoyu was a bit of a "病娇," so she didn't take her words at face value. She sat down next to Xiaoyu and said, "Come on, tell me what's really bothering you." 

Xiaoyu hesitated for a moment before finally speaking up. "Well, it's just that... I wanted to borrow a book from the library, but someone else got to it before me." 

Su Chenxi was surprised. "Is that all? Don't worry, I'm sure there are plenty of other good books in the library. We can go together after class and find something else for you to read." 

Xiaoyu's expression brightened up at Su Chenxi's suggestion. "Really? That would be great! Thank you so much, Su Chenxi!" 

Su Chenxi smiled and patted Xiaoyu's shoulder. "No problem, that's what friends are for."
