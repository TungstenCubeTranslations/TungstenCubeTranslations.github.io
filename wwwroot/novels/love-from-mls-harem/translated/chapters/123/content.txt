Xia Ge went straight to the ready-to-wear clothing store, knowing full well that Ye Ze must have disappeared here.

However, the store was empty and had closed down.

Looking up, the black and white teeth on the pillar of the clothing store had also disappeared.

"Hmm?"

Under the gaze of the crowd, Xia Ge kicked the door open and entered, but the store was also empty, and there was no one in the former dungeon.

A little beggar who knew her pulled her away and said, "Why did you kick the door? If the officials come later, you'll be in trouble..."

"Officials" were similar to government agencies, but were composed of immortal cultivators to maintain peace in the town.

Xia Ge asked, "Where are the people from this store?"

"They closed a few days ago," the little beggar replied.

Xia Ge had lived in the dilapidated temple for a few months, and she and the little beggar were somewhat familiar with each other. She smiled when she heard this.

The clue was obviously broken. Xia Ge asked, "Do you know where they went?"

The little beggar shook his head. "How would I know?"

"Thanks anyway."

Watching the little beggar's back as he left, Xia Ge felt a headache.

Ye Ze was indeed taken away, and his identity must have been discovered by the people from the Evil Ghost Camp.

This was not good.

But the old beggar seemed to know a lot about the Evil Ghost Camp, and she should get a lot of clues if she asked.

Xia Ge turned back to leave, but as she hurried towards the outskirts of the town, she turned onto an official road and saw several people hurrying towards her, looking both reluctant and uneasy, as if they had seen something and were avoiding it.

Xia Ge frowned and walked past them. After a few steps, she passed a narrow dead-end alley without paying attention. However, after two more steps, she heard a few obscene laughs coming from the alley.
"Looks pretty good..."

"Haha, we could make quite a bit of money selling them to the Dream Tower..."

"Let this old man touch them first..."

"Why cover your eyes? Let this old man take off the blindfold and have a look?"

..."

Xia Ge had a bad feeling and stopped in her tracks.

She thought of the unsuspecting passersby from earlier.

...So that's what's going on.

She thought of Ye Ze, who had disappeared without a trace, and told herself not to meddle. Just dealing with Ye Ze had given her a headache, so where would she find the energy to worry about other people's lives and deaths?

...Don't worry about it, Xia Ge.

= =

The sky was dark and gloomy.

She couldn't see.

Her world was just an endless, silent darkness.

The blindfold was removed from her eyes, but the world did not become bright. Darkness shrouded everything, and no matter what, she couldn't see the way forward or the light.

The stench of a man filled the air.

"Haha, this kid's skin is really tender..."

"...Let me touch them quickly."

Footsteps approached, paused, and then hurried away.

With an indifferent disregard for what didn't concern them.

This world was truly bitter.
Who can come and save her?

No one, probably.

Coming closer, getting closer.

Faint footsteps outside the alley.

Two people walked by.

Three people walked by.

...

No one stopped.

No one will stop.

Dirty hands caressed her face.

Burning hot, nauseating.

Strange, the white cloth was taken away, but she opened her eyes and couldn't see anything but darkness.

The beautiful girl looked up, her blood-stained white cloth was removed, revealing her light gray apricot eyes like frosted glass.

There was no radiance, as if covered in dust, unable to let any light in.

"Why is this kid like a piece of wood--"

"Hehe, wood is fine too..."

Chuyi thought.

It seems that no one can come and save her.

...No, it's not about whether they can or not, it's about whether they will or not.

From beginning to end.

From start to finish.
The only one who can save herself is herself.

She tilted her head back, with her hands behind her back, looking innocent and kind.

Everyone likes this kind of appearance, a sweet and obedient child who smiles beautifully.

She also likes this appearance very much.

If she could always be like this, it would be so good.

The man was stimulated by her innocent appearance and felt even more lustful. He became impatient and said to his companion, "Wait here, I'll go first."

...She has always been obedient.

Why are there still so many people who want to hurt her?

The sinful hand slowly moved down, as if it was going to tear her clothes. There was only one person in front of her and another person watching from the side.

Heavy breathing.

- Why hasn't anyone come to save her yet?

She really, really wants to be a very obedient child.

Really wants to.

= =

"Just ignore it."

Xia Ge did exactly that, but after walking a few steps, she still didn't hear any cries for help.

- Don't worry about it, Xia Ge!

The man who was talking nonsense at first suddenly let out a muffled groan.

A hint of blood smell quietly spread out.
"Bloody smell?!"

When Xia Ge regained her senses, she had already followed her instincts back to the alleyway, thinking of at least luring the members of "Zhi" over, although they might not necessarily care, but...

Why did she have to deal with so much trouble! Who would understand that she was still a child!

Suffocating!

However, Xia Ge hadn't finished cursing yet, and everything in front of her instantly choked all her thoughts in her throat, unable to speak a word -

It was dripping fresh blood.

Two men, one familiar girl.

Sharp, pitch-black dagger.

The pink satin of the girl was stained with a full bloody smell. One of the men lowered his head, facing away from Xia Ge, with the sharp tip of the black dagger penetrating through his back. In the dark alleyway, Xia Ge could see the bloody light reflected off the tip of the dagger.

A fatal blow.

The gushing blood stained the girl's clothes red. The white bandages that had once been wrapped around her eyes fell to the ground. Despite being covered in blood, her light gray glassy eyes couldn't seem to reflect any blood.

Her lifeless eyes seemed to be staring at the alleyway, as well as the late-arriving Xia Ge.

Lifeless.

Dull.

Like Dou Dou, who was covered in scales and blood all those years ago.

This gaze was saying.

- Why did you only come now?

Xia Ge felt like her heart was instantly clenched by that gaze, and then slowly pulled apart and shattered.

The man beside her was gaping in disbelief, unable to imagine that a five-year-old girl could have such a lethal force. The next moment, he muttered, "Killed... killed - killed him -"

He stumbled and crawled away from Xia Ge, his face full of panic, screaming, "Killed someone!!!"

Xia Ge stretched out her leg, and the man who was screaming stumbled and fell, his teeth knocked out. When he got up again, he had already lost some of his teeth, covering his mouth and staring at Xia Ge, whimpering and unable to speak. Xia Ge looked up at him, her pupils icy, and a faint purple glow seeped out, "Shut up and get out of here!"
The purple light was mesmerizing, and in an instant, a sense of instinctive obedience emanated from the man's heart, causing his body to tremble. He then ran away in a panicked scramble.

On the other side, the little girl pulled the black dagger out of the man's chest.

Blood spurted out.

The little girl didn't even try to dodge, allowing her pale face and neck to be stained with bright red blood. The man's body slowly slid down, and finally, his head leaned against the little girl's slender shoulder.

The little girl's face was facing her, her light gray glass-like pupils devoid of any light. The cherry-red lips on her blood-stained snow-white cheeks made it difficult to distinguish which was redder, her lips or the blood.

A numb, expressionless face.

Covered in blood.

The dark alleyway had no light.

Xia Ge thought of Dou Dou.

Different places, different ages.

But it was the same, covered in blood, eyes devoid of life, and a numb face.

- If she had arrived earlier.

- If she hadn't been so indifferent.

The quiet and dark alleyway had no light.

Today, it didn't snow.

The little girl slowly lifted her head, the weight of the man resting on her. She didn't mind, and the black dagger in her hand was dripping with blood as she muttered to herself, "Mother said, there are eight sufferings in the world: birth, aging, sickness, death, resentment, separation, seeking, and not obtaining..."

It was still that day, the sweet and shy voice that answered her questions, with a childlike confusion and innocence.

Tainted with the color of blood.

Suddenly, Xia Ge felt a bit cold, an icy coldness emanating from her heart.

Like the bleak and white snow color that fell into her eyes when Dou Dou knelt in front of her with his body covered in blood.

At such a desperate moment.
Xia Ge once thought,

"If only someone could have come to save Dou Dou and the others at that time."

But...

The little girl murmured, lightly licking the blood on her lips. She seemed to be asking Xia Ge, but also asking herself, "So, are you here to save me?"

Xia Ge was speechless.

Unable to hear Xia Ge's answer, the little girl didn't care. "If you're not here to save me, then you must be here to catch me," she said. 

"..."

"Or maybe you're just passing by?"

"It doesn't matter who you are," the little girl said, placing her hand on her chest. "Whatever your reason for being here, can you tell me why life is so hard?"

Xia Ge remained silent.

No answer was forthcoming.

"But it's okay," the little girl said, licking the blood on her lips. She didn't seem to expect an answer. She just murmured, "Blood is sweet...and warm."

She smiled slightly, as if she had figured something out. "It's very warm."

When warm blood splattered on her body,

She didn't feel cold anymore.

...So?

-There was a moment.

Xia Ge suddenly began to hate the person she had been just a moment ago.

That person who didn't care.

Hate her deeply.

You never know how your indifference can plunge someone who once had hope into such despair.
What often makes people feel cold-hearted is not the adversity, but the indifference of others. It's clear that all it takes is a helping hand, and things wouldn't be like this. It's clear...

Xia Ge walked over and moved the girl's body aside, kicking it to the side. The heavy body fell to the ground with a muffled thud, as if it had hit someone's heart. It was chilling. She reached out and wiped the blood off her face, whispering softly, "You're wrong. Blood isn't sweet."

The girl didn't avoid her touch like before. It was just that the black dagger pulled out of the man's chest was pressed against her chest, sharp and dangerous. It was as if she could meet the same fate as the man at any moment. Xia Ge, however, didn't feel scared. She just felt heartache. Very heartache.

Just like three years ago, when Dou Dou, covered in blood, gave her a bun, she felt heartache. "Blood is bitter," Xia Ge heard herself say. "Not only is it bitter, but it's also dirty."

The black dagger in the girl's hand still pressed against her chest, not loosening. Her voice was very calm, losing the gentle shyness she had when drawing eyes a few days ago. It was as if the beast's nature had been exposed, allowing her to reveal the fangs of a little animal. "It's sweet. You're lying."

Xia Ge ignored the dagger on her chest and reached out to brush away the girl's blood-soaked hair. The hair was swept away, but there were still bloodstains on her forehead. Xia Ge leaned down, ignoring the dagger that had pierced her clothes, and the dangerous tip of the dagger licked her chest. She lowered her head and gently kissed the girl's forehead, slowly kissing away the blood on her forehead.
Then she whispered softly,

"I tasted it."

"This blood, it's bitter."

The temperature of her lips was warm and soft.

The girl's hand was a bit unsteady.

...very gentle.

No one had ever been so gentle with her before.

Her mother only called her a whore, and the maidservants only obeyed her orders with trembling.

No one had ever been so gentle with her before.

Daring to be so gentle with her.

...it's a little sweet.

It seems sweeter than blood.

- But she wasn't here to save herself, why be so gentle?

"You're lying to me." She said, feeling anxious, her voice still calm, even the tip of the dagger moved slightly inward, "Blood isn't bitter, it's sweet."

Outside the alley, chaos reigned.

The man who ran out seemed to be calling for someone. If the people of the order came, this child would be punished.

Killing goes against the laws of the order.

Because of her moment of indifference.

She picked up the butcher knife.

"That's because you're too bitter, that's why you think it's sweet." Xia Ge held her wrist with the knife, trying to make her voice soft and gentle, but couldn't hide the slight trembling in her voice. She said to her, "I've tasted many very sweet things."

"So, for me, blood is really too bitter."
The child looked up at her, just like Dou Dou back then, with the same bewildered and alarming expression. Do all invisible people look like this? They would stubbornly stare in one direction as if they could see, their bodies trembling from committing cruel acts, but their eyes always appeared so resolute and gentle. Chu Yi's hand holding the knife trembled as she listened to the person's incredible words, "Life is not suffering. Aging, sickness, death, resentment, hatred, love, separation, and longing are all part of the normal human experience." It sounded so sweet, and the person's trembling voice made her feel warm. But she wasn't here to save herself. She was just like those passersby, strangers who had nothing to do with her. "I don't believe you," said the little girl in a childish voice. The pink silk dress had already been dyed dark red with the man's hot blood. As time passed, the warmth of the blood gradually dissipated, and the icy coldness crept into her heart with the breeze blowing through the alley. The scorching hot blood would only give her a few moments of warmth, and what followed was the piercing coldness. She couldn't hold the knife in her hand steadily anymore, and it was shaking and about to fall.
"It's very cold.

Why does it have to be so bitter again?

The streets outside are getting more and more chaotic.

Xia Ge's eyes deepened slightly. This child, covered in blood, couldn't stay here any longer. If they were discovered by the authorities...

She took off her coat and wrapped it around the little girl.

"Can we avoid these people?" Xia Ge softened her voice. She steadied the little girl's hand, which was shaking slightly, on the knife pressed to her chest. She repeated, "Don't speak. Can we avoid these people?"

Unlike the man from earlier, who was tall and bitter, this person was thin and small, but had a slightly sweet taste.

Very soft hands, also warm.

Even if he wasn't here to save her.

She didn't want this person to die.

...It would be great if he was here to save her.

"...Are you here to save me?" She asked softly, gently, with hope, asking again.

The hustle and bustle outside the alley drowned out Xia Ge's low response.

"Mm."

The little girl didn't speak, but the knife in her hand drooped slightly, obediently allowing Xia Ge to pick her up.

Like a small beast with half its claws retracted.

Testing cautiously.

Xia Ge held the girl in her arms, activated her Ghost Shadow technique, and flipped over the low wall of the alley. At the moment the girl landed, she heard a panicked and forced voice from the other side of the wall, "That's her, that little bitch..."

"...Where is she?"

Xia Ge wanted to cover the little girl's ears, but she had no hands left.

The child still heard it."
The little girl's eyes were covered with a blood-stained white cloth, and at some point, the dagger in her hand had been completely dropped.

This person was very sweet.

Sweet enough to ignore the insignificant bitterness.

So she wanted more.

More and more.

It didn't matter if she lied.

As long as she could get more and more.

She tugged at Xia Ge's sleeve.

Her voice was small and gentle, "It's so bitter." No, actually it was very sweet.

This embrace was really gentle.

It didn't matter if the person was a stranger.

They might even kill her, but it didn't matter.

It didn't matter what happened.

As long as she could feel a little warmer.

She was feeling a little cold now.

"It won't be bitter for long." Xia Ge comforted her.

The child's body was cold, and although Xia Ge was also cold, she wrapped her tightly, like two people who only had each other to rely on, and lowered her head to be careful, having used her soul-snatching technique to drive away the man earlier.

After leaving the alley, Xia Ge felt the meager amount of copper coins in her pocket and looked at the sky.

The sun was hidden in the clouds and the sky was a bit gloomy, as if it was going to rain soon.

So the question was, should she take care of this poor little girl first, or hurry back to the dilapidated temple to ask the old beggar about the whereabouts of the evil spirits' camp to save Ye Ze?

Previously, she had ignored the matter because she was afraid of this dilemma - to be honest, she wanted to find Ye Ze, who was missing and possibly dead, as soon as possible.
The situation of that person is obviously more dangerous than this child's.

The little girl sensitively perceived Xia Ge's dilemma. She grabbed Xia Ge's sleeve with one hand and pointed the tip of her knife at Xia Ge's chest with the other hand. Her voice was soft and sweet, "You said you tasted something very sweet, so blood is bitter."

"Are you lying to me?"

-- Once you catch hold of something, you can't let go.

This sweet person is now hers alone.

Xia Ge: "......"

Three minutes later.

Xia Ge touched her empty money pouch with one hand, and held the little girl, who had changed into new clothes and was holding a sugar-coated hawthorn, with the other hand. She silently pondered the meaning of life.

Well, she had spent all her savings from the past few months.

She was really poor.

Life is so hard.

"Sweet." The little girl bit the hawthorn and spoke softly, "Very sweet."

Don't lie, little liar. Xia Ge didn't believe that the former noble girl had never eaten sugar-coated hawthorn before.

You are very sweet, while she is very bitter.

Xia Ge looked at her new clothes with melancholy, "Is that so? Why do I feel a little bitter?"

System: "......"

Xia Ge led the girl to a sparsely populated area outside the town and touched her head.

The little girl was very obedient and allowed Xia Ge to touch her.

"Okay, now I have to go back."

Xia Ge said seriously, "Do not kill anyone again, that is a crime."

It should be called a crime over here, right? Oh well, let's hurry back.
The little girl suddenly tightened her grip on the last hawthorn candy skewer, "You're leaving?"

"No!" she exclaimed.

"Are you going to abandon me?" she asked.

"No!" she replied.

Xia Ge was very practical, "I can't afford to take care of you."

The system remained silent.

The little girl held onto Xia Ge's leg very seriously, "I'll give you my life, don't leave me."

They couldn't be separated.

It would be bitter.

This person was very sweet.

She belonged to her.

They couldn't be separated, not even in death.

The little girl had bits of hawthorn candy in her mouth and her words were choked with sobs, making it sound insincere.

Xia Ge thought, "What am I supposed to do with your life? I can't sell it for money. This logic is ridiculous."

...But she was just a child.

Xia Ge sighed, crouched down and said, "I have to go find someone, and it will be tiring to follow me."

The little girl shook her head, released Xia Ge's leg, and tugged at her sleeve, "I don't need you to take care of me, and I won't get tired."

Xia Ge thought, "But I will get tired."

The system spoke up, "Host, um, she's a member of Ye Ze's harem, a key plot task, cough, cough..."

Xia Ge responded, "Oh. What does that have to do with me?"
System: "......" It's not responding to soft or hard approaches.

Despair.

Xia Ge patted the little girl's head and said, "I'm sorry."

She had to venture into the haunted camp alone to save the chosen one. It was better not to involve anyone else.

Xia Ge stood up to leave, and the little girl slowly let go of her sleeve.

After a few steps, the little girl suddenly spoke with lifeless eyes, "Killing is wrong, isn't it?"

Xia Ge was slightly taken aback, then nodded, but realized the other person couldn't see her, so she just made a sound, "Hmm, it's wrong."

Her voice sounded a little distant.

Chu Yi thought to herself.

Three steps.

- She had to keep this person.

"Did I kill the wrong person just now?" The little girl tilted her head innocently, "Am I guilty?"

Xia Ge thought of everything that had happened just now.

The child covered in blood, with a numb expression on her face.

The more innocent she was, the more cruel it all seemed.

Xia Ge: "......"

She didn't know what to say.

This child was just like Dou Dou back then.

Equally desperate and helpless.
At that time, Dou Dou faced bullying but didn't have the choice to pick up a knife, and could only passively endure. This child, on the other hand, chose to pick up the butcher's knife.

Excessive self-defense.

In a moment, roles can be reversed.

People are quick to see the excessive harm suffered by the perpetrator, but in doing so, they often overlook the despair and terror suffered by the victim.

"Although he wanted to harm you, you've already killed him, haven't you?"

People say this.

You're guilty, regardless of the reason.

The little girl took a step towards her, her cherry lips slightly parted, and asked, "Am I wrong?"

Each word hit her like rain, it was very cold.

It was even colder hitting her heart.

It was like thorns, whipping her moment of indifference bit by bit.

After a while, Xia Ge heard herself say, "You're not wrong."

She took another step towards her and asked, "Am I guilty?"

One step, two steps, the distance between the two people, and one more step.

It was like the distance between heaven and earth.

Finally, Xia Ge sighed and turned around, squatting down to hug the child one step away in her arms, shattering the seemingly insurmountable distance. Her slightly childish voice was filled with gentle coaxing, "You're not guilty."

The guilty one is not the child who chose to pick up the knife, but rather herself who chose to be indifferent in that moment.

"But if you leave," the little girl's voice was childish, "I will kill many, many more people."

"I won't listen, and I'll commit many, many sins."

"I'll always be a bad kid."
"She has to do this in order to survive.

Otherwise, she would have her eyes gouged out, be sold, be bullied, be humiliated, and eventually die silently in a dark corner.

Even in death, no one would care.

Xia Ge stood still and didn't move.

"If I killed many people like I did just now," she asked, "would it be wrong for me to be alive?"

She asked with the innocence of a child.

After a long time, Xia Ge heard her own hoarse voice.

"No one is wrong for being alive."

Even the most vicious thug.

He also has the right to live.

"You are not wrong either."

When no one helps and there is no hope, people will choose to pick up the butcher's knife.

Xia Ge suddenly thought of a sentence she saw in her previous world.

"It's not me who's wrong, it's this world."

A naked portrayal.

"But I want to be a good child." - If good children don't die.

She looked up, as if asking herself, "How can I be a good child?"

"Can you tell me?"

How can she be a good child who can survive?
The little girl held a sugar-coated hawthorn skewer in her right hand, with another hawthorn still on it, while her left hand was behind her back. She looked up with a sweet and innocent voice, her white and tender face stained with blood. Her almond-shaped eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of light grey glass, hazy and misty, and were soon wet by the broken raindrops.

A pale lightning bolt pierced through the dark sky, followed by rumbling thunder and drizzling rain.

The sound of rain confused the little girl's senses, and she didn't know what the person was doing.

The person didn't answer her.

In the darkness, even her hearing was blurred by the rain.

"Can you walk?" she asked, panicked and uneasy, yet trusting.

"I can't," the person replied.

This person would definitely not leave.

She thought, but slowly tightened the handle of the meteorite dagger in her left hand.

If this person didn't agree.

Then...

"Buddha said, there are eight sufferings in life."

Birth, aging, sickness, death, resentment, separation, love, and unfulfilled desires.

Xia Ge thought.

Perhaps she was about to experience the ninth suffering of raising a child.

Xia Ge turned around and took the hand of the child holding the sugar-coated hawthorn skewer, sighing, "Before I tell you..."

"...put down the knife in your left hand."

The little girl smiled as soon as Xia Ge took her hand, and obediently put the meteorite dagger she had hidden behind her back back into its sheath.

Xia Ge thought, it's better this way.

If she abandoned this child now.
So what's the difference between choosing to be indifferent at that moment and hating what you hate yourself?

Maybe you'll feel powerless.

But she will do her best.
