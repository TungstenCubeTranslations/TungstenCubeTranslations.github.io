The voice was clear and penetrating, interrupting the lively discussion. For a moment, the entire Dan Training Ground fell silent.

Xia Ge lifted her head and saw a figure on the platform to the north. Several disciples dressed in Dan Feng plain clothes sat in the front row. Because she didn't squeeze to the front to see the results, she was at the southernmost part of the huge Dan Training Ground and couldn't see who was on the platform.

However, Xia Ge, who had failed the exam seven or eight times, understood very well that this was the examiner for this exam who had come to announce the top six and return the pills the candidates had refined. He would also encourage and welcome those who had failed to come again next time.

On the other hand, Mao Qing encountered this scene for the first time, and she was puzzled. "Huh...will someone come over too? I thought the results would just be posted here today..."

Huo Bai still held a grudge against what happened before and sneered, "Everything is what you think, isn't it?"

Mao Qing was annoyed. "Why are you so petty? I won't argue with you anymore!"

Xia Ge said, "Shh...it seems that something is going to be announced above."

Huo Bai snorted and didn't say anything else. Mao Qing rolled her eyes at him and also quieted down.

The clear voice above rang out again and spread throughout the huge Dan Training Ground. "First, announce the top six of this entry-level competition!"

"The first place, Huo Bai, with the Chi Blood Pigu Pill!"

Although she didn't know who the first place was, applause still rang out around her. Xia Ge also clapped her hands and said, "Congratulations!"

Mao Qing clapped her hands reluctantly. "Hmph, congratulations."

Huo Bai didn't say anything, just looked at Xia Ge.

"The second place, Mao Qing, with the Pigu Jin Dan!"

Huo Bai also clapped his hands, and Mao Qing snorted, but her expression had softened a lot.

In this way, the top six were announced one by one, and every pause was accompanied by applause. After the announcement of the top six, the second project should be the distribution of the pills that each disciple had refined during the competition.

"Entry-level disciples, line up according to your own ranking!"

Huo Bai and Mao Qing were the first and second, so they naturally had to go first. Mao Qing smiled at Xia Ge. "Then I'll go first."

"Go ahead." Xia Ge waved her hand.

Huo Bai was also about to leave, but Xia Ge suddenly said, "Brother Huo, please stay."

Huo Bai stopped and looked at her in confusion.
Xia Ge smiled at him and glanced at the white jade pendant hanging from his waist. "Brother Huo's jade pendant is really beautiful. Where did you buy it?"

Huo Bai responded with an "oh". "I was bored after the exam and wandered around the marketplace here. Do you think it's nice, Junior Brother Xia?"

"Yes, it's a rare and beautiful jade," Xia Ge chuckled. "Since it's so pretty, Brother Huo should take good care of it."

"It's just a piece of jade. If Junior Brother Xia likes it, I can give it to you," Huo Bai said, pretending to take off the pendant. Xia Ge quickly said, "Oh no, I couldn't possibly accept it. I was just complimenting it. A gentleman doesn't take what someone else loves. Brother Huo, you should go collect your reward!"

Huo Bai stopped his actions and glanced at her. "Then I hope Junior Brother Xia can also get the beautiful jade she desires soon."

He bid farewell and left.

Once he was gone, Xia Ge stretched her neck to look at the table.

The person who gave him water was still there, with a gourd hanging from his waist. Xia Ge's neck-stretching made him chuckle. He knew her name and joked, "What are you looking at, Junior Brother Xia?"

Xia Ge exclaimed and shrunk her head, then said seriously, "I'm looking for the beauty of our peak."

Yes, she was looking for her senior sister.

"Beauty? Who's that?" The person was slightly stunned, then realized and scolded with a laugh, "Hey, you brat, why are you so frivolous!"

"Just looking is considered frivolous?" Xia Ge felt wronged. "Besides, I haven't even seen her yet."

"Hahaha, as a senior disciple of this peak, if you see her, the heavens would have turned upside down." The person laughed heartily. "Stop daydreaming and focus on preparing for your next exam! With your talent, if you don't blow it up, you'll definitely pass next time."

Then he winked at Xia Ge. "When you get in, I guarantee you'll see her every day. But at that time, I think you won't want to see her anymore."

Xia Ge quickly understood his meaning.

So it's like the headmaster of the Dan Peak?

See but not want to see?

Very vivid.

However...

"Senior Brother, that's not true. Senior Sister is so beautiful, I could never tire of looking at her," Xia Ge bragged with her eyes wide open. "Senior Sister is so pretty, if I could get in, I would look at her a hundred times, a thousand times, and never get bored."

However, as soon as Xia Ge finished speaking, she saw the boy with the gourd hanging from his waist widen his eyes slightly, his body stiffening. His eyes were full of disbelief. Xia Ge hadn't had a chance to ask him what was wrong when she heard a faint voice behind her. "Lu Qie, who did you say you don't want to see?"
The voice sounded somewhat familiar.

...Senior Sister?

Xia Ge's back stiffened in an instant. Although she hadn't said anything bad about that person, for some reason, she felt more guilty than if she had.

The person seemed to be approaching, and the young man opposite her stiffened for a moment before quickly reacting, "Haha, Senior Sister, what are you doing here... haha, of course, I don't want to see the Master."

Gu Peijiu ignored Xia Ge's stiff posture and walked to her side. Facing the young man named Lu Qie, who had a gourd hanging from his waist, she said, "If you keep pretending to be an outer disciple and talking nonsense here, I'll make you copy the prescription for Rejuvenation Pill."

...Pretending to be an outer disciple? Wasn't this the person who said he was too nervous to check his grades... an outer disciple?

Xia Ge looked at Lu Qie, who had gone from a smiling face to a embarrassed expression as if he had been caught playing games in a secret internet cafe by the headmaster. Her lips twitched.

The sect members knew how to have fun.

After finishing her words, Gu Peijiu glanced at Xia Ge, her black eyes carrying a hint of unknown meaning. After a while, she asked calmly, "Why don't you go to the front to receive the medicine?"

She was asking her.

Before Xia Ge could speak, Lu Qie, who was still trying to defend himself, suddenly realized, "Senior Sister..."

Gu Peijiu didn't even look at him. "Go copy the prescription for Huichun Pill ten times."

"...Huh?" Lu Qie was confused.

Seeing him still standing there stupidly, Gu Peijiu's deep black eyes swept over him. "Twenty times."

"Ah!! I'll go copy it now!! I'll go!" Lu Qie suddenly came back to his senses and ran away into the crowd before she could say "thirty times". His speed was almost comparable to that of a ghost, and Xia Ge couldn't help but admire him.

After the person she didn't like had left, Gu Peijiu looked at Xia Ge sideways, calmly assessing her. Then she asked again, "Why don't you go to the front to receive the medicine?"

The young man's eyes had a faint hint of green, and he looked like he hadn't slept well. It seemed that he couldn't find the green hairband he usually wore, so he tied his hair with a black string. He hadn't grown much yet, and his head only reached her chest. He was small, as if she could reach out and touch his soft hair at any moment.

- The eyes... are like Wu Yin's.

- I'll take you to see this world! This world is super beautiful!

Gu Peijiu's heart skipped a beat. Then she calmed herself down and looked at the young man with a slightly scrutinizing gaze.
It seems that they were standing too close.

Perhaps it was the aggressiveness in the other person's gaze, Xia Ge suddenly felt a bit nervous. She instinctively took a step back, then grabbed her hair and pointed to the crowded people behind her, "Uh...there are too many people here."

"It's okay," Gu Peijiu said, "I'll take you there."

Xia Ge hadn't reacted yet, but a soft sandalwood fragrance spread out and her cold hand was held. Her fair hand was covered by a wide sleeve embroidered with red maple leaves. Xia Ge could clearly feel the warmth on her hand, like a warm jade, extremely soothing.

This warm jade-like feeling started from her hand and slowly spread to her limbs, finally reaching her heart, making it beat with more strength.

The power to possess...to shatter all anxieties and lies.

After Xia Ge reacted, she subconsciously wanted to withdraw her hand, but the hand that held hers was warm and gentle, with a strength that Xia Ge couldn't break free from.

"Don't move," Gu Peijiu said, "I'll take you up."

Xia Ge slightly stiffened, inexplicably obedient and motionless.

She actually always hated physical contact, including holding hands and other bodily contact, she had a spiritual cleanliness, even before her rebirth.

The blood-stained red and white robe, the warm embrace with sandalwood fragrance, and that sentence.

--You should rest.

But it seemed that if it was Senior Sister, it wasn't that unpleasant.

Xia Ge slowly relaxed.

However, the next second she became nervous again. Wait, go up? Go where? Where to go?

Gu Peijiu held her hand and walked forward. The girl was dressed in a red maple plain garment, with delicate eyebrows and eyes, her black pupils were cold, like a person in a painting, so beautiful that people couldn't look directly at her. Xia Ge wanted to withdraw her hand, but was held even tighter.

Someone in the crowded people in front saw her and was suddenly shocked, almost instinctively making way for her.

"Who is this...?"

"What a beautiful woman..."

Although they were doubtful about her identity, they were fascinated by the noble and cold temperament around the girl. The crowded flow of people slowly parted, Xia Ge was led by someone holding her hand, looking at the path leading to the announcement of the results, and the curious and enthusiastic gazes of the crowd, for a moment, she had the illusion of walking on the red carpet as a celebrity.
"It must be an illusion.

The abnormality here was obviously discovered by the disciples who were distributing pills according to their numbers. Just as they were puzzled, another person exclaimed, 'It's... it's Senior Sister!' 

What is Senior Sister doing here?

'Hurry up and make way, make way... Senior Sister is coming!' 

With an inner disciple clearing the way, the road suddenly became wider. Mao Qing, who had just received the pills, felt the commotion in the crowd and turned around to see a graceful girl in red and white maple clothing walking on the spacious road with her hand holding...

'Oh my god, isn't that Xia Wuyin?' 

Mao Qing widened her eyes and instinctively pulled at the sleeve of Huo Bai beside her. 'Hey, look! It's the legendary Dan Peak Senior Sister with Xia Wuyin!' 

After pulling for a while, and getting no response from Huo Bai, Mao Qing felt that something was wrong. She looked up and saw that Huo Bai just moved aside and said in a flat tone, 'I saw it.' 

Mao Qing failed to find any resonance and eventually gave up on Huo Bai, her eccentric ally. She then excitedly said to herself, 'I knew it! He won't be eliminated just like that! Senior Sister is here! Let's wait and see!' 

There was surprise, curiosity, and inquiry among the crowd as Gu Peiju led the boy up the steps, stepping on the soft cushions. In an instant, the sky and clouds changed, and she was a little distracted. 

In the blurry dream and light, it seemed that someone was holding her hand, leading her step by step towards the endless stairs. 

Looking at Gu Peiju who suddenly stopped, Xia Ge was a little confused. '... Senior Sister?' 

Why did she stop here? 

Gu Peiju lowered her eyelashes for a moment, then quickly regained her composure and continued forward. 'Hmm, nothing.' 

The two of them then climbed onto the stage together. The stage was high, and after they went up, they had a broad view. The crowd at the Dan competition stopped what they were doing and looked up at Gu Peiju on the stage, waiting for her to speak. 

'First of all, congratulations to all the disciples who made it onto the list.' 

The girl's voice was clear and light, 'From today on, you are all members of the Dan Peak Inner Sect.' 

After a moment of confusion, the people below felt that the Dan Peak Senior Sister had come here not just to say these formalities, so they applauded. 

Xia Ge had been holding hands all along, feeling a little strange and uncomfortable, but it was not appropriate to pull back. She just felt a little confused. 

As the applause died down, Gu Peiju's voice rang out again, 'Secondly, there is another matter.' "
The audience was silent, everyone listening intently.

"I will be accepting a special disciple this year," the girl's voice was calm. "As you all may have heard, it is the person beside me, Xia Wuyin."

The applause abruptly stopped, and there was silence.

Xia Ge felt an indescribable embarrassment. She wanted to retract her hand, but couldn't do it for a while. Helpless, she could only lift her head to look at her. "Senior sister, can I take the test again next time?"

Oh my god... with so many eyes watching, it was embarrassing to use connections so blatantly.

"I remember you promised me before," Gu Peiju didn't look at her and spoke in a voice that only the two of them could hear. "You said you would definitely make it into the top three."

Xia Ge suddenly choked up. The strength of her grip weakened, and she avoided eye contact. "Uh, this... isn't it just an accident?"

So suddenly becoming a special disciple made her even more nervous. Wasn't she a failure before?

Gu Peiju lowered her eyelashes. "Are you feeling guilty?"

Xia Ge laughed it off. "No, no..."

However, under the other's pitch-black eyes, she finally lowered her head. "...Actually, a little."

Just as she was feeling uneasy, she heard Gu Peiju say, "It's alright."

After the silence below, there was suddenly a burst of even more enthusiastic applause than before!

Xia Ge was stunned.

Someone laughed, "Haha, I knew it! How could someone who refined the Three Lives Golden Pill be rejected!"

"Our Dan Peak has hope! Don't even think about the Heavenly level, but maybe we can produce a Earth level alchemist. When that happens, we'll make the trash at Sword Peak kneel and lick our boots!"

"What nonsense, do you think you can refine an Earth level pill without an Earth level formula?"

"Don't worry, we can find one!"

"Can you even find one?"

"I can't, but someone who can refine the Three Lives Golden Pill might be able to..."

"The special disciple is well-deserved, but you still need to practice your furnace control skills..."

 
"..."

The applause below was incessant, and the voices of the people were boiling. Xia Ge lost her composure for a moment, and the girl in red held her hand lightly.

"No need to feel guilty."

"You are just the one who is favored by the public."

The voices below were boiling, and the geese in the sky were flying south. Xia Ge stood high, looking at the girl holding her hand. For a moment, her cold blood became warm, and her lifeless heart seemed to beat slightly at this moment.
