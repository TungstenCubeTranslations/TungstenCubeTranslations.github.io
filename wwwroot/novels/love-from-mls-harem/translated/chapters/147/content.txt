Chu Yi hesitated for a moment, looking at Xia Ge's bright eyes, clenching her fists under the wide sleeves embroidered with fluttering silver butterflies, but still wearing a faint smile: "He told me that the autumn maple leaves in Danfeng are very beautiful."

Gu Peijiu came up the mountain path, with Lu Qie following behind her. She brushed Chu Yi's shoulder and walked in front of Xia Ge, turning around and leisurely saying, "Then you came at the wrong time."

"It's spring now."

Xia Ge habitually grabbed Gu Peijiu's clothes corner, while Lu Qie went up and helped the Danfeng youth who was being held by several Jianfeng disciples. She winked at Xia Ge and said, "Xiaozhangling is so good."

Xia Ge smiled back.

The young man obviously knew Lu Qie and was a bit hesitant, "Senior Lu..."

Gu Peijiu gestured, "Lu Qie, you take them back."

"Okay!"

Lu Qie patted the young man's shoulder, "Alright, let's go."

After saying that, she helped the young man and intentionally or unintentionally separated him from the Jianfeng disciples, and took him away.

After Lu Qie took the people away, Chu Yi's gaze turned slightly cold. The Jianfeng youths who were standing still and didn't know what to do suddenly shivered and quickly helped the kneeling youth up and left unsteadily.

"Although the autumn maple leaves are beautiful, they also have a sense of decadence." Chu Yi smiled lightly, staring at Xia Ge, "Compared to that, I still prefer to come and see the flowers in spring."

It was a naked gaze, without any concealment.

Xia Ge's heart chilled slightly. Before she could think carefully about the meaning of this gaze, Gu Peijiu pulled her hand and stood in front of her, blocking that naked gaze.

She looked at Chu Yi, her gaze even colder, her voice still flat without any emotion, "It's early spring now, the flowers in Danfeng haven't bloomed yet. Miss Chu should return to Jianfeng."

Chu Yi stared at the hand that Gu Peijiu was holding Xia Ge's hand with, the smile on her lips deepening, but her eyes became even more cold, "Haven't bloomed yet? But the flowers I want to see are only in Danfeng. What should I do?"

A head popped out from behind Xia Ge, blinking, "What flowers? I have all the flower seeds from Danfeng. If you want, I can give them to you."

System: "..."

Gu Peijiu pressed the person back without expression, and said flatly, "Since Miss Chu has such refined tastes, Danfeng can also make room for this flower viewing place."

After speaking, she took Xia Ge's hand and turned around to leave.

Xia Ge felt that her senior sister was holding her hand a little tightly and walking very fast. The gaze behind her was chilling, and when she turned her head, she met Chu Yi's gentle and sweet smile.
I don't know why, even though it was just an innocent smile, Xia Ge couldn't help but feel a shiver down her spine. Before she could even turn around, Gu Peijiu grabbed her hand and pulled her forward. Suddenly, she was pressed against a tree, her back aching. Chu Yi's figure had disappeared from her sight, replaced by Gu Peijiu's beautiful face.

Gu Peijiu stared at her with pitch-black eyes that seemed to be empty, yet also filled with waves of emotion.

The rough bark of the tree pressed against Xia Ge's back, and she was held down by Gu Peijiu's hand on her shoulder. She was a bit confused and asked, "Senior Sister...?"

A breeze blew Gu Peijiu's clothes, and she couldn't hold back anymore.

The illusion array engraved on the doll was useless against Gu Peijiu, so she could clearly see through the illusions and see the girl's true beauty.

After three years of careful nurturing, the thin child who didn't differentiate between boys and girls had grown soft flesh. Her thin eyebrows framed a pair of beautiful cat-like eyes that sparkled like water. She had bright eyes and white teeth. When she had a growth spurt, the once small and short girl suddenly shot up to 1.67 meters tall, but her body was still thin and frail, no matter how much she ate.

She will be taken away.

If she didn't do something... she would be taken away.

Gu Peijiu thought of Chu Yi's fierce and determined eyes and her own eyes darkened.

Xia Ge was a bit confused about what was happening. Although Chu Yi was a bit strange, she could understand what he was doing. She also guessed that her true identity might be exposed. But... what was happening with Senior Sister?

To be honest, Xia Ge was a bit bewildered.

Feeling uneasy, Xia Ge asked, "Senior Sister, are you...?"

Gu Peijiu stared at her and suddenly asked, "Is she pretty?"

Xia Ge was confused for a moment before realizing who Gu Peijiu was referring to. "Ah? Who...? Oh, you mean Chu Yi?"

Gu Peijiu didn't say anything, but her silence was an affirmation.

"Well... she's okay, I guess," Xia Ge thought for a moment before replying seriously. "Her peach blossom makeup today was pretty good."

From the perspective of a seasoned makeup artist, the makeup technique was quite clever.
When the girl spoke, she slightly squinted her eyes and lifted the corners of her eyes, with a hint of admiration flowing in them.

...It was very charming.

Xia Ge looked at her and smiled, "But in my eyes, Senior Sister is still the most beautiful."

Gu Peijiu's breath slightly hitched, and the next moment, the string called "reason" in her head suddenly broke!

Her head was suddenly pressed down, and the moist and soft feeling was suddenly pressed against her lips. Warm, soft, and a little bit of uncontrollable madness...

Xia Ge widened her eyes, and in her line of sight, the slender butterfly-like eyelashes of the person in front of her trembled slightly.

They separated, and Gu Peijiu leaned against her forehead, her voice low and hoarse.

"...Do you like it?"

Xia Ge's pupils lost focus, and her mind went blank.

--Couldn't hold back anymore.

The person she liked, the person she thought about day and night, was right in front of her.

She had been thinking about this girl day and night, unable to sleep or eat peacefully. And this child was carefree and didn't know anything, so it seemed like she could like anything and everything was fine.

...But how could it be fine?

--So, do you like it?

She couldn't remember anything, didn't know what to do, and didn't know how to answer. Xia Ge's unfocused pupils slowly focused, but when her vision became clear the next second, she saw Chu Yi.

The silver butterfly fluttered around the girl, and Chu Yi supported herself on the wutong tree with one hand. Because the distance was far, Xia Ge couldn't see her expression clearly, but those pitch-black almond eyes stared at her, and Xia Ge suddenly felt chills all over her body. Almost in an instant, she regained her senses, instinctively broke free from Gu Peijiu's restraint, and the next moment, her "Ghost Shadow Vanish" technique was activated, and her whole person disappeared without a trace!

...Empty.

Gu Peijiu also slowly regained her senses, and on her pure white hand, there was still the residual warmth from the girl's shoulder.

Soon, it turned cold.

Gu Peijiu suddenly clenched her hand tightly and closed her eyes.

Chu Yi looked from afar, the mountain wind was slightly cold, blowing her soft forehead hair, and the silver butterfly fluttered and danced. Under the flickering light, her hollow eyes looked even more eerie.
"...Ha." She murmured, "...what I can't have."

Why can others have it?

Should she destroy it?

It was a beautiful and fragile flower, not yet bloomed, but already driving people crazy.

Should she... destroy it?

Chu Yi looked at her white wrist, her long eyelashes trembling slightly-

"If you don't love yourself."

"No one will love you."

Love herself?

No one loved herself more than she did.

So, she wanted to destroy everything she couldn't have.

In her hand was the poison that would destroy the flower.

Just release a little bit of the trigger, and the flower that was nurtured by others would bloom beautifully on the surface but slowly wither at the roots.

-"Brother, will you come back this time?"

-"Of course I will come back."

"When I come back this time, little butterfly will be able to see it."

"Wind and Moon Nine States, mountains and rivers, all creatures under the sky, you will be able to see farther and farther with those beautiful eyes, then..."

-"No! I don't want to hear about then! I just want to see my brother."

-"...I want to be by my brother's side all the time."

"..."

Chu Yi's body trembled slightly, and she slowly closed her eyes. Silver butterflies suddenly flew up, fluttering and swarming around her.
Reluctant.

Reluctant, reluctant, reluctant, reluctant!!!

Cannot be destroyed.

Cannot be harmed.

"......I will get it back," Chu Yi murmured, "I love myself so much."

So, brother, you will still love me, right?

= =

"So as long as it can be used well, evil spirits are also excellent materials for alchemy..."

"......"

Xia Ge propped her chin, flipping through the pages of the formation textbook during the alchemy class, her gaze a little unfocused.

System: "...Host?"

The system thought for a moment: "Host, your period has come."

Xia Ge didn't respond to it, her gaze still unfocused.

System: "Host, your Eight Wasteland Flute has been stolen."

Xia Ge murmured, "Ah, stolen, then let it be stolen."

System: "......"

The system thought for a moment and felt that attracting attention in this way was a bit foolish.

System: "Host, you have more than 30,000 points, don't you want to exchange them for something good?"

Saying this, Xia Ge unconsciously bit her pen, testing its hardness with her teeth.

Xia Ge: "Hmm, ah, good stuff, indeed, very hard."

Too hard, not as soft as Senior Sister's.
Translation:

System: "......" Damn idiot.

Xia Ge wasn't actually dumb, it was just that she was still a little dazed from her senior sister's attack yesterday.

Class was over, but Xia Ge was still in a daze, absent-mindedly drawing and writing on the paper with a pen in her hand.

"Hey, what are you writing?" Mao Qing's voice was lazy. Ever since she came back from the south, she had been like this, always lazy and uninterested in anything.

But there was a strange beauty to it.

Xia Ge didn't appreciate this strange beauty, she just felt that Mao Qing was even lazier than before since she came back from the south. Before, she was lazy in form, like it was very difficult to go down the mountain to buy a cake, but now she was lazy in temperament, like it was impossible to speak a little faster.

But no matter how lazy she was, her speed at snatching Xia Ge's draft paper was still fast.

Before Xia Ge could hide it, Mao Qing had already snatched it and said, "Let me see..."

Xia Ge didn't try to grab it back, she just looked at Mao Qing in confusion.

As Mao Qing read it, her brows furrowed, "There's a pretty girl on the mountain."

Starting a new line.

"And there's another beautiful girl on the mountain."

Starting a new line again.

Mao Qing: "......"

Xia Ge propped up her chin and looked at her, confused, "Keep reading."

Mao Qing put down the paper expressionlessly, feeling like she needed to fix Xia Ge's future as a little priestess.

The last line asked, "Can the big girl like the little girl?"

Can a big girl like a little girl?

Xia Ge was a little crazy, she pulled her hair, "Why did you stop reading? I don't understand!!"

She had seen it before, she wasn't unfamiliar with it, two girls, like the puppeteer Alang in the town and her wife, but...
However, why?

Why would someone like me?

Does Xiaga also like girls? She doesn't know--

Looking at Xiaga's puzzled expression, Mao Qing suddenly thought of the look Gu Peijiu gave this child at the promotion ceremony a few years ago.

Looking at this paper, the cause and effect seem... not difficult to guess.

In the end... couldn't resist it?

Unfortunately, the king had intentions, but the goddess was heartless.

Perhaps...

It's not that she's heartless, she just doesn't understand yet.

Interesting, really interesting, indeed... interesting!

Mao Qing chuckled lightly, crumpled the paper and put it aside, leaned close to Xiaga's face without any hesitation, her long eyelashes almost brushing against Xiaga's cheek. She gently lifted Xiaga's chin, her pupils meeting Xiaga's eyes, her voice ambiguous and sweet--

"So, do you think I can like you?"
