Sword Peak.

Several disciples wearing blue and white sword robes were chatting under a tree.

Li Liu sighed, "Ah, I'm a bit tired."

Chang Nian glanced at him but didn't say anything.

A disciple next to them said, "Just hold on a little longer."

They were all members of Chu Yao's guard team, but obviously Chu Yao didn't care about them and just let them patrol around Sword Peak, turning them into Sword Peak's guard team.

Ye Ze leaned against a tree by himself, not talking to them, holding a iron sword in his hand. His eyes were slightly bruised and he looked a bit gloomy.

He closed his eyes slightly, then opened them again. His voice was low and hoarse, "Whose bell is that?"

Li Liu, who was chatting with someone, looked at him in surprise, "Bell? What bell?"

A disciple said, "Just ignore him."

Li Liu tried to smooth things over, "Maybe Brother Ye really heard something."

Ye Ze didn't say anything else, just stared at Chang Nian, who was carrying a heavy sword, and slowly narrowed his eyes.

Li Liu said, "But we really didn't hear any bell sound."

The faint sound of a bell had been ringing before, but now it had rung a few times and was quiet again, as if it had never appeared.

Ye Ze paused and said, "I must have misheard."

Chang Nian sneered, "Do you really need to seek attention like this?"

Ye Ze didn't say anything else and closed his eyes.

= =

It is said that dark nights and strong winds are suitable for murder and arson.

Sword Peak has many forests, lush trees, and abundant wild fruits.

Xia Ge wore night clothes, with a bag of melon seeds in his pocket, and had picked a few ripe persimmons along the way, knocking the wooden puppet and the dragon jade with a missing corner on his waist.
System: "...What are you here for?"

Xia Ge was tired from running and took off her black face towel, squatting on a tree while munching on melon seeds. "Hey, I need to eat before I can work."

The system held back and said, "Hurry up and get ready. That guy will be making a move tomorrow night."

"Hey, the emperor is not as anxious as the eunuch." Xia Ge peeled a persimmon and took a bite. "It's really sweet."

After finishing a persimmon, she stretched lazily. When she had just walked over, she saw Ye Ze. A group of people were chatting over there, but he was alone, leaning against a tree with his eyes closed, looking like a lonely and isolated person even in the guard team.

But at least he wouldn't get beaten up.

After finishing a big persimmon, Xia Ge also finished the sunflower seeds that Mao Qing had given her today. She clapped her hands and felt unsatisfied. Her gaze turned to the remaining persimmons in her hand.

"Hmm, is this one astringent or not?"

The system said, "Don't eat anymore. Hurry up and work."

Xia Ge said, "What's the rush? Little Red isn't here anyway."

Little Red was the nickname Xia Ge gave to the red ribbon. It was simple and straightforward.

The red ribbon was a strip of cloth torn from Tianzhu Ling by her senior sister. Xia Ge originally thought it was a clone of Tianzhu Ling, but after seeing its behavior, it didn't seem like it.

...It was too clingy. Was Tianzhu Ling like this? Its original form and style of painting from her senior sister looked completely different.

But if Xia Ge took Little Red with her, her senior sister wouldn't know where she was going.

Yes, that's how it was.

It was too scary! How could she keep a straight face and skip class in the future? It was like the head teacher had put a GPS navigation system on the most mischievous student!

How could she endure this? She absolutely couldn't!

System: "..." You really know you're mischievous.

Whether it was a clone or a split-off little demon, it had to be thrown away!

The system couldn't figure out whether it was a clone of Tianzhu Ling or a little demon that had regained consciousness after splitting off. Xia Ge couldn't be bothered to care either.

Just throw it away.
System: ".... It's still here."

Xia Ge: "Huh? Nonsense! I clearly tied it to the bed!"

It was given by her senior sister, and she didn't dare to throw it away. However, Xia Ge had a trick up her sleeve. She usually tied things to a pole with a tight knot.

It always worked like a charm.

But this time, it seemed to have failed.

As soon as Xia Ge turned around, she saw the red ribbon hanging from a persimmon tree branch not far away. She didn't have time to hide it, so she had to pretend it was dead and hang it upside down.

Xia Ge: "...."

Her smile gradually disappeared from her face.

"What the hell!"

Xia Ge dashed forward, grabbed the ribbon, and roared in a low voice, "How the f*ck did you follow me?! No, how could you follow me?! No - you actually followed me?! Are you crazy?!"

The ribbon shrank back in fear, then wrapped around her hand affectionately and rubbed against her wrist as if nothing had happened. The whole ribbon even stretched and yawned lazily.

Xia Ge: "...."

"There seems to be some movement over there!"

"Quick!"

The movement was a bit too much, and it alerted the guards. Xia Ge gritted her teeth and stuffed the ribbon back into the pocket where she kept her melon seeds. She activated her ghostly shadow technique, and her shadow instantly became like a ghost. She lowered her voice, "If you dare to betray me again, be careful I tie you to a candle."

After a pause, Xia Ge was afraid that the other party didn't know what a candle was, and whispered in a threatening tone, "It's something that burns, do you understand?"

The ribbon wriggled a few times in her pocket.

...Just pretend that you know.

System: "...."

"It was just here..."

Li Liu walked to the persimmon tree, but looked around and frowned, "No, did I hear wrong?"
Chang Nian said, "Anyway, let's be careful and stop chatting."

After speaking, he glanced at Ye Ze who followed behind and snorted, "Don't close your eyes, or people will think you're blind."

Ye Ze remained silent for a while, looked at him, and suddenly asked, "Brother Chang... do you have a bell with you?"

Chang Nian was taken aback and immediately became somewhat embarrassed and angry. "Who has a bell? I..."

Li Liu was also surprised. He looked at Ye Ze and then at Chang Nian. "This..."

As his gaze shifted, he caught sight of several hawthorn trees to the east. Li Liu stiffened slightly, then calmly withdrew his gaze.

"I just heard the sound of a bell twice, and it came from you," Ye Ze said, unaware of Li Liu's gaze. "The second time was just now."

Chang Nian: "..."

Seeing everyone looking at him, Chang Nian snorted and said, "So what if I have a bell? It's none of your business!"

Li Liu was puzzled. "Brother Chang, why would you bring a bell to the guard team?"

Chang Nian took out a silver bell from his pocket. The bell was small and delicate, obviously a woman's accessory. He shook it, but there was no sound. "Look, I have a bell, but it won't ring! Don't talk nonsense!"

Li Liu asked, "Brother Chang, why do you have a bell with you?"

Moreover, it looked like a woman's ankle bell.

Chang Nian impatiently put the bell away. "That's none of your business."

Ye Ze stared at the bell, watched Chang Nian put it away, and then glanced at Li Liu. He didn't say anything else.

Li Liu said, "Since Brother Chang's bell won't ring, then the bell sound that Brother Ye heard..."

Seeing that Ye Ze was holding a sword and not speaking, Li Liu paused, changed the subject, and pointed to the west. "There's no one here. Let's go and take a look over there."

No one objected, and they all walked away. Ye Ze followed behind them, but after taking a few steps, he stopped and looked at the hawthorn trees to the east.

Chang Nian was still resentful that Ye Ze had exposed him for bringing the bell. Seeing that Ye Ze had stopped, he wanted to pick a fight. "Why aren't you leaving? Are there immortals over there?"

Li Liu also said, "Brother Ye, why aren't you leaving? There's some activity over there. Let's hurry and go to the west."
Ye Ze paused, withdrew his gaze, ignored Chang Nian, and said to Li Liu, "Let's go."

The few of them left.

Shortly after they left, Xia Ge cautiously poked her head out from behind the hawthorn tree and looked in their direction. A small red ribbon on her head also followed her movements, hiding behind the tree and peeking out.

Feeling that there was no danger, Xia Ge breathed a sigh of relief. "Finally, they're gone."

Xia Ge pulled the red ribbon off her head and stared at it with resentment. "It's all your fault."

The red ribbon twisted and pretended not to hear.

Xia Ge: "..."

Alright, I can't do anything to you anymore?!

Xia Ge grinned, raised her hand and tied it to a tree branch, pretending to tie a few more knots.

System: "Stop it, hey! If the people from Jianfeng see it later, Danfeng will be the target!"

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge clicked her tongue, put the red ribbon in her pocket, and said, "I'll deal with you later."

System: "You better hurry up and find where Chu Yao lives, don't dawdle."

Xia Ge frowned. "We've already left...but I still feel that something is strange."

System: "What's strange?"

Xia Ge: "...Is it just my imagination, or did Li Liu seem to have noticed something just now?"

System: "It's probably just your imagination. If he really noticed something, why would he lead the group towards the west?"

Xia Ge: "That's the most strange thing to me..."

It was as if he knew something was here, but deliberately let it go.

Could it be...

Xia Ge's pupils slightly contracted. She quickly put the persimmon in her pocket and said, "Let's go!"
The system hasn't reacted yet, "What's going on?"

"I don't know if my guess is right or not, but let's just go!"

Before coming, Xia Ge had looked at the map of Jianfeng and had a general idea of where Chuyao would be. Usually, Lingxi Peak would prepare luxurious single rooms for senior disciples and those with special identities. She wasn't sure if her guess was correct, so Xia Ge felt a bit impatient and searched quickly.

Chuyao's residence was a delicate small bamboo building, built on the mountain with a small bridge and flowing water. A towering parasol tree stretched its branches and leaves to the roof of the small bamboo building. Xia Ge lightly landed on a branch of the parasol tree above the small bamboo building, and her whole body disappeared into the darkness, as light and silent as a cat.

She held her breath.

The system asked, "Is this the place?"

Xia Ge nodded, "Yes, this is it."

What surprised Xia Ge was that it was already so late at night, but the bamboo building was still lit up.

In the quiet night, the bamboo building was still illuminated, and fireflies flew around her. Xia Ge gently patted the fireflies flying around her and then touched the two remaining persimmons in her arms, letting out a sigh of relief, "I ran too fast earlier, but luckily they're not squashed."

The system couldn't help but ask, "Why didn't you put them in your ring?"

Xia Ge said seriously, "They're for eating. I feel more at ease keeping them in my arms."

The system remained silent.

Xia Ge looked around and asked, "It's so late, why haven't they gone to bed yet?"

"They're probably busy. We know where they are now, so let's go back quickly." The system hesitated for a moment and added, "...after all, Xiao Hong is here."

Xia Ge paused and looked at the red ribbon in her pocket.

In other words...

Most likely, her senior sister already knows she's here.

But Xia Ge shook her head and said, "I feel like something's not right. Let's stay a little longer."

Since they had already followed this far, it wouldn't hurt to wait a little longer.

However, Li Liu's attitude earlier was too strange, which made her feel uneasy.

The fireflies flew away, and the mosquitoes came. Xia Ge was about to reach for them when she heard a "snap," and the red ribbon hit her neck, catching a dead mosquito.
Xia Ge: "......"

Xia Ge: "Who let you out? Go back, go back."

The red ribbon dropped the dead mosquito and slowly retreated.

Xia Ge squatted for a while, yawning several times. The clouds covering the moonlight dispersed, but she didn't see anything unusual. The room was brightly lit. Just when Xia Ge thought she might have been overthinking things and was about to pack up and leave with Jianfeng's persimmons, the door of the bamboo house creaked open.

There was movement!

Xia Ge immediately became alert and looked down.

But she saw a girl in thin clothes, wearing wooden clogs and carrying a wooden sword around her waist, coming out of the bamboo house in the dim moonlight. The loose white clothes revealed her neck and shoulders as white as jade, and the wide sleeves fluttered in the mountain breeze. Her black hair, damp with moisture, lazily draped over her shoulders. The hard wooden clogs exposed her tender white toes. The whole person was extremely lazy.

It was Chu Yao.

It seemed that she had just taken a bath and came out to enjoy the cool breeze.

Xia Ge: "......" Why would you carry a wooden sword around your waist when you just finished taking a bath and came out to enjoy the breeze? Are you cosplaying?

System: "She looks really good."

Xia Ge shamelessly said, "I look good too, I look good too."

System: "......"

Xia Ge: "......"

The red ribbon stretched out from her pocket and nodded at Chu Yao seriously.

Xia Ge put it back in her pocket and said coldly, "You don't count."

Suddenly, Chu Yao scolded in a low voice, "Who's there?!"

Xia Ge was startled. Was she discovered?! Just when she was about to activate her Ghostly Shadow Technique and escape, she saw a black figure flash by even faster than her. The cold blade in their hand reflected the moonlight and instantly attacked Chu Yao!

Xia Ge was so scared that the persimmons almost fell out of her arms. "Holy shit?!"

Besides her, there was someone else?! Who was it? Bai Ren? No, wasn't he coming tomorrow? What was going on?! Oh my god! 

"Clang!"
Chu Yao reacted quickly, with her wooden sword at her waist, she used her single hand to block the opponent's iron blade attack with a sharp aura!

"Tsk." Chu Yao's light brown eyes reflected the cold moonlight, "Is this trash here to steal the key?"

The shadow remained silent, missed the attack, quickly retreated, and burst out with spiritual energy in his hand. The iron blade vibrated, emitting a strange sound wave. At the next moment, countless shadows rushed out of the bamboo forest and charged towards Chu Yao!

Xia Ge's eyes almost popped out, "Why are there so many?!"

She had been squatting for so long and didn't notice!

"Tsk."

Chu Yao's eyes flashed with cold light. In her hand, the wooden sword drew a beautiful sword flower and shook off the rushing shadows. Wearing wooden clogs, her figure was as fast as lightning, chasing after the black-clothed person without letting go! The black-clothed person couldn't shake off Chu Yao's attack, so he gave up running and directly engaged in a battle with Chu Yao!

Xia Ge finally saw that all the shadows rushing towards them were wearing identical bronze masks and holding various weapons. An abnormal magic aura surrounded them, and they were all puppetized!

The two fought fiercely with swords and knives below. Chu Yao, in her thin clothes, was deadly against the puppets and spies. The black-clothed person seemed to hum, and at the next moment, he turned his long sword in his right hand and fiercely suppressed Chu Yao's wooden sword. With his left hand, he closed two fingers and shouted, "Freeze!"

Suddenly, a white light appeared in the black-clothed person's hand. Cold and sharp ice overflowed from the long sword, freezing the girl's wooden sword and hand together! Chu Yao was caught off guard, and behind her, a puppetized figure jumped up. With a huge sickle in hand, it slashed horizontally towards Chu Yao's fair neck under the moonlight!

Xia Ge's pupils suddenly shrank, and the persimmon in her hand almost slipped!

[One-hit kill]!

"Die!"

The black-clothed person grinned. Chu Yao's eyes flashed with cold light, and before she could react, at the next moment, with a "bang," something sticky exploded from the puppet's face with a sharp aura, blasting off its mask and head into pieces!

The sweet fragrance of persimmons spread out.

"Who are you?!" The black-clothed person was shocked, then stunned, "...persimmons?"

Chu Yao's lips curled up with a cold smile, "Who cares who I am? Look closely, your auntie is here!"

The cold ice that restrained Chu Yao's hands suddenly exploded, and the wooden sword covered in frost suddenly slashed towards the black-clothed person's neck!

"Boom!"

A puppet rushed up, blocking this fatal blow for the black-clothed person. The entire puppet was cut in half by the wooden sword!

The remaining puppets didn't give up and rushed towards Chu Yao like a tide. The black-clothed person saw the opportunity to retreat and heavily surrounded Chu Yao with the puppets!
System: "Why hasn't the guard team arrived yet when things have gotten to this point?"

Xia Ge thought of Li Liu, "Maybe, probably, because they were led away?"

Chu Yao was trapped by the puppets that came one after another. Xia Ge took a quick glance and saw that the Demon Cult had really spared no expense to get the key. Each puppet was at a B-level, but luckily she had leveled up before with her one-hit-kill ability. Otherwise, she couldn't be sure if she could smash their faces in. Seeing Chu Yao being held back by the puppets and the black-clothed person about to rush towards the small bamboo house, Xia Ge quickly covered her face with a black cloth, pounced forward, and swung her sickle towards the black-clothed person's head!

"Stop right there!"

"Clang--"

The cold blade clashed with the sickle. The sword looked small and light, but the power behind it was incredibly strong. Even with Xia Ge's innate divine strength, her small body was still thrown into the air by the impact. She managed to do a few flips in the air to adjust her body, secretly amazed.

She didn't expect the power behind that strike to be so great. Chu Yao managed to easily catch it with a wooden sword, thinking that the black-clothed spy's strength couldn't be that strong. But when she tried it herself, she was sent flying by one sword strike.

How embarrassing.

The black-clothed person sneered, the sword reflecting the cold moonlight. He leaped up like lightning, his cold sword striking towards Xia Ge's head!

"Get out of the way!"

"Swish--"

Xia Ge hadn't swung her sickle yet when the sword arrived. The sharp chill almost brushed past her neck, but suddenly, a thin red ribbon shot out, intersecting and weaving into a blood-red spider web in an instant, blocking Xia Ge. The black-clothed person's sword strike hit the spider web, causing sparks to fly everywhere. The black-clothed person grunted as countless thin red threads shot out from the spider web, wrapping around his sword and slashing towards his head!

The black-clothed person saw that the situation wasn't good and quickly pinched a spell with his left hand. The sword was instantly covered in countless ice, freezing the red threads that hadn't yet wrapped around it. Then, the ice shattered with a "crackling" sound, and the sword, which was flashing with cold light, was withdrawn from the red threads' wrap.

Freezing the cloth and then peeling it off?

Everything happened in a split second. When Xia Ge reacted, the black-clothed person had already made all the necessary movements and was ready to leave.

Such a slick operation, he must be an elite of the Demon Cult. Xia Ge couldn't help but concede.

The red ribbon was frozen stiff, so Xia Ge calmed it down and wrapped it around her wrist, holding the sickle in her other hand as she charged towards the black-clothed person. Unexpectedly, a cold wind blew from behind her, and she instinctively dodged. At the same time, a giant sickle swung down from her side, cutting off half of the phoenix tree behind her with its gust of wind!

Damn, it's another demonic puppet!

The broken branches of the phoenix tree fell onto the roof of the bamboo house with a loud noise. The demonic puppet missed its strike and flipped its sickle, striking horizontally towards the direction Xia Ge had dodged to!

She definitely couldn't block a B-level puppet's sickle!

The sickle strike was fierce and fast, leaving Xia Ge with almost no time to react or dodge. By the time she realized it, her hand had instinctively blocked in front of her. The next moment, a strange feeling rushed up her wrist--
...power.

"Strength that can move mountains..." No problem, it's power.

"Clang!"

Instinctively, Xia Ge used force and saw a violent spark being generated as the scythe held by the demonic puppet that clashed with her was suddenly cut off and the entire puppet was sent flying by her.

Xia Ge widened her eyes and as she lowered her head, she saw the red ribbon on her wrist.

No...it wasn't just a red ribbon anymore.

The originally bright red ribbon was now covered with intricate golden patterns, coiling around her wrist, and the two ribbon tails were rhythmically moving like breathing.

Xia Ge had seen this state before.

Senior Sister...when she used the Flowing Fire Heaven's Punishment, the red silk that covered the sky was in this state of being covered with golden patterns.

And now, it was coiled around her wrist, and a strange power was transmitted to her. Holding the scythe, Xia Ge had a momentary illusion that if she slashed down with all her might, she could split this mountain in half.

This cloth demon was lending her its power.

Every cloth demon had its own characteristics and unique power.

The reasons for the creation of cloth demons were varied. Some were created by curses, or by the evil or good intentions of a person. Some people had great merit and saved the world, and a cloth demon's soul was born from a good intention and attached to a robe, becoming a cloth demon born of good intentions. Some people were full of evil, doing all sorts of bad things, and their clothes were filled with strong evil intentions and curses, becoming a cloth demon born of evil intentions. Some were human souls that didn't want to reincarnate or become puppets, wandering in the human world, gradually dissipating, and attaching themselves to clothes.

In their lives, there were people who were heroes who shook the world, fierce ghosts who caused trouble in one region, or even legendary gods who were high above everything, with a wide range of abilities.

Some say that people with strong willpower can control cloth demons and obtain their power, while those with weak willpower will be controlled by cloth demons and become puppets.

But there is another kind.

That is, cloth demons willingly lend their power to you.

Not control, not manipulation.

Because cloth demons are not dead, they are alive.

They have their own emotions, beliefs, likes and dislikes, and although they don't cry or laugh, they can also be sad or happy about certain things.

Because they are alive, they yearn for a name, and they will only have one name.
This is proof of their existence in the world.

Some clothing spirits name themselves and, when acknowledging their master, tell them their name and lend them their power. Others are born nameless, waiting for the day they meet someone they have a connection with to name them and follow them for life.

This clothing spirit... even though she didn't know its name, it was willing to lend her its power?

When Xia Ge came to her senses, the black-clothed person was already about to rush into the small bamboo house!

Xia Ge instinctively reached into her pocket for a persimmon, "Stop right there, damn it!"

[One-hit kill]!

With a persimmon in hand and bound with a red ribbon, she launched a one-hit kill attack. In an instant, the persimmon rolled with a terrifying gust of wind and smashed into the black-clothed person's head without hesitation!

"Boom--"

The black-clothed person reacted quickly, flipping the sword blade in his hand and producing a strange melody. The next moment, a demonized puppet appeared behind him, and the persimmon instantly blew up its head into smithereens.

The scorching persimmon juice burned her face, and for a moment the black-clothed person seemed stunned, looking up at Xia Ge.

Xia Ge felt like the way the other person looked at her was different now, with eyes full of "Holy crap, it really was a persimmon?!"

What's wrong with persimmons? You look down on persimmons or something!

However, before Xia Ge could say anything else, the other person glanced at her and rushed towards the bamboo house, seeming very confident that the key would be there.

Just as the black-clothed person was about to enter the bamboo house, a annoying demonized puppet charged forward to block the way. Xia Ge, relying on the power of the clothing spirit in her hand, sliced open one puppet after another with a sickle, making it seem like cutting vegetables. She created a bloody path for herself.

She couldn't let him in!

Xia Ge reached for another persimmon, but found her pocket empty. She had only picked two persimmons from the sword peaks. The first one was used to free Chu Yao, and the other one had just been thrown out. Without a weapon, how could she stop him?

Wait, without a weapon?

...Where was she without a weapon? She may not have a long weapon, but she still had other things!

As the black-clothed person pushed open the wooden door, something suddenly rushed towards him. His eyes narrowed, thinking it was a hidden weapon. He quickly retreated, but the "hidden weapon" suddenly turned and smashed into him. Unable to avoid it, he drew his sword and blocked it, feeling a strong force. When he saw what it was, he was stunned.

On the sword blade, a black-haired, black-eyed doll with an expressionless face looked at him.
The black-clothed man instinctively reached for his chest and took out a small puppet that looked exactly like the doll. For a moment, he seemed to be in a daze, like a fool, reaching out to grab the doll.

As the black-clothed man was stunned and held onto the doll, Xia Ge suddenly pulled out the puppet panel and pressed "explode" without hesitation!

"Boom!"

In the instant the doll exploded, Xia Ge's pupils shrank slightly, and her heart suddenly clenched. She stiffened in mid-air and couldn't move at all.

It was a very painful feeling that slowly spread from her heart.

It was like losing someone very important.

It was like losing a close friend, losing a loved one, losing a companion who had been by her side for a long, long time... the same feeling.

Xia Ge felt her face was wet, and when she touched it, she found tears in her hand.

The system quickly understood what had happened: "...Are you fucking stupid?!"

The violent explosion instantly turned the black-clothed man, who had just held the doll, into a bloody mess. However, even though he had encountered a sudden change, he quickly regained his senses and was about to go in when he heard a soft, hellish whisper.

"...One sword, break the mountains and rivers."
