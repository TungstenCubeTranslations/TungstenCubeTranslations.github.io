The little girl who was mesmerized by Chu Yao's divine light finally stumbled back home. It was then that Chu Yao remembered she was still holding onto a fake hero.

Xia Ge had been closing her eyes all afternoon, too tired from her work. She heard Chu Yao boasting about herself to the little girl, claiming to be the best in the world, and fell asleep under the moonlight.

"Hey," Chu Yao said, frowning and shaking the person in her hand. "Wake up, shorty."

No response.

Chu Yao thought to herself, "Just a moment ago, she was so energetic and willing to offer herself, and now she's suddenly so tired?"

Chu Yao snorted and noticed the unsightly pancake the little guy was holding tightly in his arms.

...Can that pancake be eaten?

Chu Yao put the person down and glanced at the green hairband carelessly tied in his hair, furrowing her brows.

Green hairband... Is this guy an outer disciple of the Lingxi Peak?

Generally speaking, inner disciples of the Sword Peak wear blue swordsmanship clothes, while outer disciples wear blue hairbands. Inner disciples of the Dan Peak wear red maple clothes and tie red hairbands, while inner disciples of the Beast Peak wear animal clothes and tie yellow hairbands.

She didn't have time to check the color of this guy's hairband last night when she was thinking in the attic.

Could he be an outer disciple of the Sword Peak?

Thinking of his ghostly speed and extraordinary judgment, Chu Yao felt that this person was most likely an outer disciple of the Sword Peak.

After all, the assessment for inner disciples of the Sword Peak was different from that of the Dan and Beast Peaks. They needed to have speed, agility, strength, and judgment.

Judging from his speed and ability just now, this guy seemed to be a very likely candidate for a failed inner disciple of the Sword Peak.

Chu Yao furrowed her brows and looked at the little guy in a sleeping position, unable to help but think of the annoying negotiation she had with him yesterday.

...This shorty is full of crooked ways and evil methods, no wonder he couldn't pass the assessment for the Sword Peak.

While she was thinking, the little guy sleeping on the ground suddenly stirred.

"Umm..."
Summer puckered her lips and curled up with the pancake in her arms.

"Smells so good."

Chu Yao: "..."

No matter how attractive that glance was, looking at this face now made her want to hit someone.

She furrowed her brows and crouched down to grab the pancake from the kid's arms. "Let go, you can't eat it!"

Chu Yao exerted some force, but Xia Ge's hand holding the pancake remained still, his eyes closed, looking as steady as an old dog.

For some reason, Chu Yao felt like he was pretending to sleep.

"Hmph."

Chu Yao sneered. She was a candidate for the top disciple of the Sword Peak, and she couldn't even snatch a pancake from a smelly little kid who couldn't even pass the test for inner disciples?

What a joke!

Chu Yao no longer cared and released her grip. "Let go of it!"

"Chirp -"

The pancake split in half from the middle, the sound of the oil paper tearing particularly abrupt in the night. Sesame seeds splattered everywhere. Chu Yao pinched the half of the pancake that was left in her hand, looked at the torn pancake, and then glanced at Xia Ge curled up on the ground. Her eyes deepened slightly.

Just now...there was a very strong force.

The pancake wasn't snatched away, but was torn in half from the middle. It could only mean that...

The strength of the two was evenly matched.

Chu Yao: "How long are you going to pretend?"

Xia Ge: "..." It seems like he's been found out...

Time to act pitiful.

Chu Yao saw Xia Ge didn't move at all and threw the half of the pancake to the side. "Get up, I have a question to ask..."

Chu Yao's words paused slightly.
She suddenly saw Xia Ge holding the left hand of the pancake.

It seemed that the wound had torn open and fresh blood slowly flowed from the palm of his hand, soaking the torn white inner skin of the pancake bit by bit. In the moonlight, the blood red color was somewhat dazzling.

Chu Yao lost her focus for a moment.

——Under the heavy puppet, the young man in a hemp robe held the sickle of the puppet with one hand and tightly protected the child in his arms with the other. He turned his head and looked back with sharp eyes like lightning.

When she arrived, she saw it.

He was using the posture of a guardian to protect someone weaker than himself.

Clearly, he was also a child.

But he could be like a hero.

"You must always remember who the sword in your hand is swinging for!"

The first rule of the Sword Peak Ancestral Training -

"The sword in your hand exists for the strong to protect the weak."

The night wind became colder.

Chu Yao snorted and reached out to take the other half of the pancake in his hand, but her movements became lighter. "Let go, I'll compensate you with ten pancakes."

Xia Ge didn't even open his eyes and immediately said, "I'll let go if you compensate me with a tael of silver!"

Chu Yao: "..."

She sneered, "A tael of silver is a tael of silver, why don't you open your eyes?"

Xia Ge still closed his eyes and made an innocent face, "I never said I was sleeping."

Chu Yao: "..."

What did she just say? Hero?

She retracted her previous statement. Maybe her eyes were blind just now. 

Chu Yao snorted, "A tael of silver is a tael of silver. Why don't you open your eyes?"
Summer sighed, "I already said it, I was just blinded by your heroic appearance."

Chu Yao's knuckles cracked slightly as she narrowed her eyes dangerously, "Tell me the truth."

"Ah, I was just blinded by sand earlier. Couldn't open my eyes," Summer quickly complied.

Chu Yao thought to herself, why do I feel like hitting someone even more now?

Taking a deep breath, Chu Yao tried to speak, "You..."

Immediately, Summer waved her injured hand towards the hero and interrupted her with a worried expression, "Can I apply for worker's compensation on the mountain? Oh, and what about the bravery award...?"

Chu Yao thought, what nonsense is she talking about?

Summer listened to the silence on the other end for a while and thought she might not have understood, so she kindly translated, "What I mean is... I just acted bravely, will the mountain pay me? Also, I got injured, will the mountain pay me? Oh, and you said you would compensate me with a couple of silver, when will you pay me back? All at once or in installments? Silver notes or cash? I don't mind..."

Summer got excited when she mentioned silver and rubbed her fingers together, "Would you like to give it to me now?"

It would be great if she could get it now!

She could buy a small bottle of wine to calm her nerves!

"I have the money," Chu Yao snorted, "But first, tell me which mountain you're from."

Summer's heart skipped a beat.

She definitely couldn't tell the truth!

She didn't know if this person was still under the influence of the Soul-stealing technique, or if she was suspicious of her eyes just now, but in any case...

She could forget about the two silver, but she absolutely couldn't reveal her identity!

Summer closed her eyes and started to talk nonsense, "Ah, I'm from Beast Peak..."

As soon as she finished speaking, she received a notification: "Ding! Congratulations on receiving the impression of Chu Yao, a little liar from Sword Peak's inner door candidate! This impression will cause your credibility towards this person to decrease by 100%. Please take note."

Oh, so this person's name is Chu Yao.
Wait a minute, this hint... dropped by 100% just like that?

People should trust each other more, young lady!

"I told you, you have to tell the truth."

"Otherwise, what you just said, they don't give money on the mountain."

Xia Ge was in agony, "That's so inhumane! They don't even give money for doing the right thing?!"

Chu Yao snorted, "If it's from Jianfeng, I'll give you money."

Xia Ge pleaded, "They don't give money at Beast Peak?"

"Beast Peak is very poor." Chu Yao had no expression on her face, and her fingers cracked as she spoke. "Also, to be honest, don't talk nonsense to me. You don't have the smell of chicken manure that those trash at Beast Peak have."

She could admit that disciples from Beast Peak were poor, but did they really smell like chicken manure? That was nonsense! Uncle Xu, the owner of the pancake shop at the entrance, was also an outer disciple of Beast Peak, and his pancakes didn't smell like chicken manure!

Wait a minute... could it be true...

Chu Yao saw Xia Ge's expression change subtly.

Xia Ge: Although I've eaten everything when I was a beggar before... I still feel that pancakes with chicken manure flavor are a bit strange now...

Chu Yao was about to continue questioning Xia Ge's identity when she suddenly heard the pitiful voice of the shorty, "Um, did the pancakes just now have chicken manure flavor?"

So your expression just now was just thinking about whether your pancake had chicken manure flavor?!

Chu Yao clenched her fist, a grin spreading across her face, and glanced at the pancake that was particularly miserable-looking. Her grin froze slightly.

... This couldn't be summed up as just chicken manure flavor.

Chu Yao changed her expression, "Yes."

Xia Ge: "!!!"

Xia Ge looked remorseful, "I'm sorry, senior sister. I'm from Danfeng, I've never eaten pancakes with chicken manure flavor before..."

Chu Yao ignored her, "Oh, you're an outer disciple of Jianfeng." 

Xia Ge was shocked, "Senior sister, I'm from Danfeng!"
Chu Yao looked impatient, "Stop talking nonsense, you're from Jianfeng, right? Impulsive and brainless, how can we have such an outer disciple in our sect... What's your name?"

It was decided so quickly, actually all of you in Jianfeng are such strong but simple-minded warriors...

Xia Ge lowered her head, looking pitiful and ashamed, "I, I'm Xia Ge..."

Chu Yao pondered silently.

Xia Ge... strange, never heard of this person before.

"I remember you."

Chu Yao stood up and casually threw a heavy silver coin at her, "Take it, go find a doctor to bandage your hand. I want to see you in the next entry test for Jianfeng."

She glanced at the short person who was tightly holding the silver coin, looking like she had just received a huge fortune overnight, and couldn't help but twitch her eyebrows in impatience.

... Can't believe this cowardly person is actually an outer disciple of Jianfeng.

"Remember to wear Jianfeng's blue ribbon next time you go out." Chu Yao's voice was impatient, "Xia Ge."

This name, which had not been mentioned for a long time, and even Xia Ge herself had almost forgotten, was suddenly brought up by someone.

Struggling out of the pleasure of getting rich overnight, Xia Ge was momentarily stunned.

"... Yes."

"Throw away that burnt cake."

"Things that are thrown away should not be picked up again." Chu Yao turned around, her voice full of arrogance, "Xia Ge, lift up your head. Remember, you are a disciple of Jianfeng!"

- Xia Ge, Xia Ge.

Summer's long song, it's a particularly pleasant name.

Also has a pair of particularly beautiful eyes.

The resolute back and the blood shed for the weak cannot be measured by money.

At least, it is worth remembering.

When Chu Yao left, the night was cold, but it couldn't cool down the hot blood.
Under the vast silver moonlight, Xia Ge slowly opened her deep purple eyes as she held onto the huge sum of money that fell from the sky.

With her back straightened and a sword by her side, the girl looked even more extraordinary under the moonlight and the flowing light. Her blue hairband fluttered in the wind, creating a cool and elegant arc that made her stand out.

Xia Ge's lips curved slightly.

As she expected, this was a person who naturally shone with brilliance.

"I really don't want to deceive her," Xia Ge shook her head and sighed irresponsibly.

The system chuckled, "That's the coldest joke I've heard this century."

"Ah, Xiao Kui, you still don't understand me," Xia Ge was very hypocritical, "But who made her not believe me when I told the truth."

The system said, "..." Let me save your trust value that's bankrupt everywhere, host.

Humming a tune, Xia Ge happily walked back with the huge sum of money.

The highest level of lies is seven parts truth and three parts falsehood.

Plus, the other party had a hundred percent distrust in her. Even if she told the truth, it would definitely be considered a lie.

Sigh, deceiving people is really too easy.

It's hard to resist.

Author's note:

Small theater

Xia Ge: Ah... Dan Feng's hairband.

Ye Ze: Hmm, it's red and looks pretty good.

Xia Ge: Emmm...

The next day.

Ye Ze: ...Where's your red hairband?!
Xia Ge: I was originally planning to pretend to be a disciple of the Beast Peak and steal bird eggs = =

Ye Ze: Steal bird eggs...wait, what does this have to do with the green hairband on your head?

Xia Ge: Green looks good, it has the feeling of nature. =v=

Ye Ze: = =

In reality,

Xia Ge: Ah...why did the red hairband turn green after being taken out of Li Dangniang's yellow dye vat...

System:...

Xia Ge: It's a miraculous dyeing process.
