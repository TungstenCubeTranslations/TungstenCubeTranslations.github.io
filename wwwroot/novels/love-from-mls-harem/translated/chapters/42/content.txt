Su Chan chuckled softly as she gently wiped the sweat from the girl's forehead. Her black pupils held a hint of amusement that couldn't be seen on the surface. "You're so cute, I almost don't want to kill you."

But with those words, Xia Ge felt a strange sensation in her abdomen. The feeling of a sharp object piercing through it.

Because she was paralyzed, there was no pain. But blood was flowing out.

Xia Ge: "......"

System: "......Host, you're in trouble."

Xia Ge: {......Well, it's not unexpected.}

System: "......?"

Looking at Xia Ge, who was staring at her without saying a word, Su Chan gently pulled out the jade dagger that had pierced her opponent's abdomen. The sweet smell of blood filled the room as Su Chan's eyes held a lingering smile. "Little master... or should I say, cute little girl, I told you, you'll regret saving me."

The two of them fell to the ground together. It seemed that the side effects of the potential gun had been activated, accelerating the spread of the toxin. Xia Ge felt numb all over and could hardly move. Although she had been stabbed with a sharp object, she had no feeling of pain at all.

Xia Ge forced a smile. "...Ah Chan."

"Oh?"

"A girl as fierce as you won't be able to get married."

System: "......"

Su Chan's smile remained unchanged as she casually placed the teleportation stone in Xia Ge's hand. "Is that so?"

The talisman was clearly in her hand, but she no longer had the strength to crush it.

It was very dangerous.

This person in front of her was very dangerous.

Perhaps it was because the paralysis was too strong, or perhaps it was because of the frustration of her recent failure, Xia Ge felt even weak in the face of fear.

Xia Ge sighed. "......Your young master Ji was buried in a mass grave by you, right?"

Su Chan's gentle smile was enchanting. "Little girl, you've misunderstood me. There's no young master Ji, that was just a lie I told you."
Xia Ge: "Oh, is that so?" she chuckled.

Also, can you stop using the term "this slave" (奴家) already? I really can't stand it.

"I must admit, it's quite surprising," Su Chan tilted her chin up slightly, leaned in close, and gazed into Xia Ge's eyes. "Such a clever little girl, who clearly knew something was off about me, why did you still..." 

Her seductive gaze swept over Xia Ge's ragged clothes, her night clothes torn apart by vines, and her pure white undergarments stained with blood. "Why did you still try so hard to save me?"

Su Chan was very close to Xia Ge, her voice soft and alluring, her breath audible. 

"I just felt that something was off," Xia Ge looked up at the ceiling of the stone chamber. "People in this world aren't just black or white. Although you were very suspicious, I didn't have any evidence."

The ceiling of the stone chamber was an indescribable sight. Xia Ge's pupils shrank slightly, then she casually looked away, saying, "Actually, I quite like going to the Mo Family Village to drink. The peach blossom wine there is cheap and delicious... and you said you're from the Mo Family Village."

"If I go there to drink a little wine every time, I'll think about how a Mo Family Village girl died right in front of me, and that would really be a cruel punishment."

The poison of the black vines seemed to be spreading more rapidly, causing more numbness and less pain in the wound in her abdomen.

The strong always dominate, and she was now completely helpless.

"I see, how interesting," Su Chan chuckled softly. "What's the real name of that little girl?"

You're about to kill me and you're still asking for my name?

Is it meaningful?

Xia Ge looked at her.

This was a person who was beautiful to the bone, and even, no longer human. When this person pretended to be "A Chan," she still knew how to restrain herself and present herself as a pure young lady, but now, in front of her, she tore off her disguise without any hesitation. All the wickedness and wantonness of a beauty came pouring out, and Xia Ge was stared at by those bewitching eyes, and although she was a beauty, she felt no desire, only a sense of overwhelming pressure.

Beauty is in the bone, not in the skin. This woman was truly peerless, and indeed, not to be trifled with.

Xia Ge slightly averted her eyes.

"..."

"Don't want to say?" Su Chan's voice was gentle, and the blood-stained jade dagger in her fair hand fluttered lightly. "It's okay, I've always believed that when a person isn't speaking, their heart is still speaking."
She leaned in close to her ear, the dagger pressed against her chest, her voice soft and sweet like the scent of orchids. "Lei Gongzi, shall I dig out your heart and see if it can still speak?"

What a load of crap. Everyone knows Lei Gongzi is a fake name. Lei Gongzi my ass.

"Why not take flight on the winds and soar straight up ninety thousand li?" 

Seeing Xia Ge remain silent, Su Chan seemed to be addicted, lightly licking Xia Ge's ear. "Why isn't Lei Gongzi talking?"

Xia Ge shuddered at her touch and blurted out, "Holy shit, is she that shameless?!"

Dig my heart out if you want! And she even licked her!! What the hell?! Is this person insane?!

"What's shamelessness?" Su Chan seemed a bit puzzled, but her eyes still held a playful glint.

Xia Ge steadied her mind. "...Nothing."

Why was she talking about shame with a stranger like this? 

This person really had no limits.

But she really, really hated it when strangers touched her body.

Especially, really hated it.

"But what is the little miss's name?" 

Xia Ge's face was expressionless. "Actually, my name isn't Lei Feng. My real name is Nicolas Zhao Si. You can call me Nicolas, or you can call me Miss Zhao Si... If it's okay with you, please call me Miss Nicolas. Thank you."

System: "..."

"It's okay, if you don't want to say it, I understand. Miss Zhao Si." Su Chan put the jade dagger in her sleeve and smiled. "Or should I say Xia Wu Yin, Miss Xia?"

Xia Ge looked bewildered. "Xia what? I'm not..." called Xia Wu Yin.

Who was Xia Wu Yin? Such a low name, Nicolas Zhao Si didn't recognize it!

Her mouth was suddenly covered by a cool finger, the girl in red with a faint smile. "Shh..."

"This is what you told me."

Bullshit, when did she tell her that? Are you fucking hallucinating?
Xia Ge widened her eyes, looking bewildered while thinking "When did I tell you?".

"I not only know that you are Xia Wuyin, but also that you are the 556th disciple and the 88th generation of the Lingxi Danfeng," the girl smiled, "you also told me that you were going to burn paper for your ancestor."

Xia Ge: "......"

System: "......"

...So that's how it is.

Xia Ge tried to struggle: "Actually, that was someone else... My real name is Nicholas Zhao."

Su Chan smiled, "Okay, Xia Xia."

Xia Ge: "......" Xia Xia?!

Xia Ge was struck with goosebumps from this nickname. Xia Xia? What about Chun Chun? Qiu Qiu sounds good too, and even Dong Dong!

What did Nicholas Zhao do wrong to deserve such a lowly nickname?

"Why aren't you saying anything? If you have any questions, I'll answer them gently," Su Chan smiled.

Xia Ge had a constipated expression on her face, "I don't have any questions."

"Don't you even have a little curiosity? Curious about how I got into your ancestor's tomb?" Su Chan licked her lips and looked at Xia Ge's slender neck and perfect collarbone that was exposed from her torn clothes. Her eyes softened slightly, because she had been too busy protecting her in the vines, her wounds were all on her back and arms, but her chest was not injured at all, "This is not like your personality."

"......"

It's like you know me so well, I really thank your ancestors for generations.

And why be curious? Haven't you heard that the more you know, the faster you die? Especially for someone like you, a pervert.

While Xia Ge silently vowed to protect the honor of Lingxi Peak, her own life, and her ancestor's glory, the culprit who stabbed her carelessly took out a bandage from her sleeve and then began to tear her clothes.

"Ah ah ah, what are you doing!!!"

Xia Ge couldn't remain calm anymore, "You, you, you... get away from me!!!"

System: "Host, please don't make a face like you're being raped. It looks a bit contrived."
"You fake and affected motherf*cker!! My clothes are about to be stripped off!! I'm heavily injured and can't move!! Xiao Kui, don't you have any empathy?!"

Su Chan's eyes and eyebrows were full of charm, "If we don't bandage the wound, little hero Xia Xia will really have to sleep with your ancestors on the mountain."

"F*ck, you pretend to be righteous and still bandage her up, and even talk about sleeping together. Wasn't it you who stabbed me just now?!!"

With his body numb, Xia Ge couldn't resist and could only let the other person take off his shirt. His snow-white binding was revealed.

Xia Ge's face turned red, and he was so angry that smoke was coming out of his seven orifices, "You...you...you...you get away from me!! Stay away from me!! You pervert!! Don't touch me!! You sick pervert!!"

Su Chan stared at the flat binding under the girl's beautiful collarbone with a smile that was not a smile.

"...Little hero, do you really need to bind it?"

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge felt like she was as angry as when she saw a husky.

What's wrong with binding it?! Did you eat your rice from my house?! Whether I bind it or not is none of your business. Use your own white cloth!

The system comforted her, "The other party is beautiful, and you won't lose out."

Xia Ge: "..." Which side are you on?

The system whispered, "I think the other party is more at a disadvantage."

Xia Ge's face was full of indifference: {You have been uninstalled by me, goodbye. We are no longer friends.}

Is this really a matter of losing or not losing out?!!

On this side, Xia Ge was jumping up and down in her heart, while on the other side, Su Chan was slowly unwrapping the bandage, and even took out a bottle of golden medicine, carefully applying it to the wound. Then she meticulously bandaged the girl's heavily scarred back, layer by layer, and finally tied a butterfly knot at the end.

The movements were gentle and slow.

Xia Ge, however, didn't want to show any gratitude.

Slap you and then give you a sweet date. The demon cult's animal taming technique is really wonderful, and it can't be learned.
"Are you really not curious?" After bandaging her, Su Chan lifted her chin and there was a hint of charm in the corners of her eyes and eyebrows. "I can tell you anything, you know."

Xia Ge replied, "I'm not curious. Just kill me."

"I won't kill you," Su Chan said. "I was just lying to you earlier."

"Oh," Xia Ge replied.

It seemed that the little girl was really angry.

Su Chan sighed and said half-truthfully, "Actually, I have always been someone who repays kindness."

Xia Ge remained silent.

The system also remained silent.

"You might think I'm lying, but I have always... repaid kindness," Su Chan said with a low laugh.

She had always repaid kindness to those she had a connection with.

Gently, she helped Xia Ge put on the tattered clothes. Just when she thought Xia Ge wouldn't speak again, the girl suddenly said, "You're the one controlling the enchanted puppets outside, right?"

Her voice was suddenly hoarse. "At first, I thought it was the Lost Deer controlling them, but I realized that wasn't possible."

"Lost Deer is Lost Deer, and Puppet Master is Puppet Master. Although Lost Deer has the ability to control souls, it's impossible for it to control puppets, let alone enchanted ones."

"It was you who controlled the enchanted puppets, forcing me to go into the mountain to meet the Lost Deer and making me the guide to help you find the way to the Sleeping Tomb."

Su Chan didn't deny it. She just calmly helped Xia Ge get dressed and smiled. "Wow, little hero, you're really smart."

"When I came to my senses near the mural, you had already reached the third stone chamber," Xia Ge said in a flat tone. "Those small puppet formations couldn't stop you, but when you were ready to come here, you were blocked by a wall with a mural on it."

Su Chan said, "I was indeed blocked by it and couldn't get through no matter what. I thought you would have a good idea, but you just came up and smashed it, tsk."

She looked up and down at Xia Ge, smiling slyly. "It's really hard to imagine that you're a girl."
Xia Ge: "......"

The wall is there, what do you do if you don't knock? Do you recite "Open Sesame"? In the end, didn't it open anyway? You're complaining even after using it, what are you complaining about?!
