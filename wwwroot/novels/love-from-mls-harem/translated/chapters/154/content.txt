The tender green sprouts were protected by delicate hands below, finally becoming still and calm.

The young girl turned her head slightly, her black eyes sliding over the broken corner of the dragon jade hanging from the young man's waist, her voice soft.

"I want to borrow something from you."

The Evil Spirit Mountain had emerged, shaking the world. The Chi sect had sent thousands of elites to the mountain, and each sect had dispatched their own best fighters.

The Lingxi Peak was gathering disciples to go to the Evil Spirit Mountain, and Gu Peijiu was among them.

At the back of the mountain.

System: "You're not going to the Evil Spirit Mountain?!!"

Xia Ge was startled by the system's scream, rubbing her temples and taking a bite of an apple. "No, I'm not going."

"Why?!!" The system couldn't believe it, if it had hands it would have strangled Xia Ge's neck, "Zhenhun! Zhenhun Wushuang! Ancient Clothes Demon Zhenhun Wushuang! With Zhenhun, you can directly upgrade to a great puppet master-"

Xia Ge paused her apple-eating motion. "And then?"

After a heavy rain last night, the wind was light and faint.

System: "Then you'll be more powerful... No, you can't be so unambitious."

Xia Ge said seriously, "I am the leader. Senior Sister is not here, I need to watch over Dan Peak."

System: "Excuse! Excuse!"

Xia Ge gave up. "Okay, I'm afraid of death and don't want to go."

System: "..." It had lost.

Xiaosixi was wrapped around her wrist, her movements gentle. Xia Ge stared at Xiaosixi, thinking of what Senior Sister had said that day, her eyes slightly dim.

It wasn't that she didn't want to go, but if she went... she still didn't know how to face it.

"Let's go, time for class."

Xia Ge threw the apple core into the basket and turned to go to the school.
In the classroom, Xia Ge spotted Mao Qing sitting in her seat, propping her chin up and drawing something on a piece of paper with great concentration.

Feeling Xia Ge's gaze, Mao Qing looked up and squinted her eyes. "Oh, rare guest."

Xia Ge: "..."

She hadn't been to class for a few days.

"...What are you drawing?" Xia Ge thought of something from before and felt a little uncomfortable, but after thinking about it, she still spoke naturally.

"I drew something interesting." Mao Qing didn't hide it, and spread out the drawing paper. Her long eyelashes covered the deep color of her eyes.

Xia Ge took a look and suddenly froze.

It was a young man.

He had his eyes closed, a blood-colored headband tied around his hair, wearing a night-time outfit and sitting with his legs crossed on a branch of a parasol tree, quietly blending into the night. There was a shiny black sickle on his back, and his slender right hand was hooked around a jade flute at his lips, as if playing it. Above his head was a blood-stained full moon.

The drawing was only half-finished, and there seemed to be something else under the parasol tree, but it wasn't drawn.

The jade flute was depicted vividly with a delicate brush, the porcelain-white body of the flute, and a touch of blood-colored detail outlined with a vermilion brush.

Xia Ge clenched her fist, then let go, her face slightly pale.

"I had a dream yesterday." Mao Qing propped up her chin. "I dreamed of you like this, very handsome."

That flute... was the Eight Desolation Flute!

But Mao Qing had never seen the Eight Desolation Flute!

How could she dream of something she had never seen before!?

"What's wrong with you? You don't look too good." Mao Qing looked at her strangely. "Is my drawing not good?"

"No, it's very good." Xia Ge said.

Mao Qing's lips curved into a smile. "I think it's pretty good too, especially this flute. I feel like I drew it particularly well-"

"Have you seen it before?" Xia Ge suddenly asked, pausing for a moment. "I mean, this flute."

"No, I haven't."
"I haven't seen it, so how could I dream about it?"

"Why can't you dream about something you haven't seen? I even dreamed about the Bai Meng acupoint before," Mao Qing said confidently, "I hadn't seen it before either."

Xia Ge: "..."

Something's not right, there must be something wrong.

But she couldn't find it, couldn't find it...

Was she overthinking again?

"Do you like this painting?" Mao Qing chuckled, looking at the boy's pale face, his eyes slightly deep under his eyelashes. "It seems like you really like it."

She had heard the eerie sound of the flute controlling the guarding spirit at the tombstone in the back mountain, which was indeed from the Eight Wilderness Flute.

The Eight Wilderness Flute was in this child's hands.

If this child had the Eight Wilderness Flute on him, things would be much easier.

Moreover, Gu Peijiu had already gone to the Evil Spirit Mountain...

Xia Ge said, "You really do paint exceptionally well."

All day, Xia Ge felt restless, with Mao Qing's painting and the Eight Wilderness Flute on her mind.

After the teacher finished his lecture, he posted a summons for the Evil Spirit Mountain on the wall. "Those who are willing to go can sign up."

Mao Qing raised her hand, smiling, "Teacher, I want to go."

Xia Ge looked at her sideways, her doubts growing more and more, but she couldn't find the thread - why did Mao Qing suddenly want to go to the Evil Spirit Mountain?

Xia Ge said, "You..."

Mao Qing lowered her eyes, "Do you want to go with me?"

"It's too dangerous," Xia Ge quickly withdrew her gaze. "I'm not going."

"Risk brings reward," Mao Qing said, "Maybe we can find some treasure."

Xia Ge: "..."
She didn't think she could pick up anything in such a huge crowd.

The next day was sunny. Mao Qing set off for the Evil Spirit Mountain.

The Eight Wilderness Flute and the painting, Xia Ge thought all night and felt that something was off, but as Mao Qing said, she had also dreamed of the White Dream Cave before...

Thinking left and right, she couldn't come up with a reasonable explanation.

...It doesn't matter, anyway, Mao Qing just treated it as a dream.

Behind the mountain.

"I wonder how Senior Sister is doing..."

Xia Ge finished playing the flute and felt a little melancholy.

System: "Go, go to the Evil Spirit Mountain and take a look."

"If I go, won't I just be a burden?" Xia Ge was honest, "Senior Sister is so strong."

She didn't understand what the concept of SS was before, but now...

Senior Sister.

A very powerful Senior Sister.

...The Senior Sister who has always been standing in front of her.

She vaguely remembered the somewhat crazy kiss, and Xia Ge's heart skipped a beat, feeling a little lost.

Not dislike.

Not dislike at all.

But can she really like girls?

She put her hand on her chest, and her heartbeat was very steady.

At least... she didn't dislike that kiss either.

- "I'll take you home."
The heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Before putting on the silver ring, Xia Ge spent some points to upgrade the system so that it could hold teleportation stones and flutes. As if trying to hide something, Xia Ge put the items away and quietly looked up at the sky.

Just wait for Senior Sister to come back.

Anyway.

If she doesn't dislike it, then try...

Try what?

Lost in thought, suddenly, a withered leaf butterfly quietly flew past her eyes. In the midst of lush greenery, this withered leaf butterfly was very eye-catching.

It floated lightly in the air, spinning like a fairy, dancing leisurely.

Very beautiful.

It had a kind of magic that made people unable to look away. Xia Ge stared at it, unconsciously becoming entranced.

The withered leaf butterfly flew towards her.

Xia Ge extended her finger, and the withered leaf butterfly gently landed on her fingertip.

The system still didn't understand why Xia Ge suddenly didn't go to Evil Spirit Mountain, complaining on the side: "Why don't you go? You've collected so many clues before, and now you're not going. Don't you hate giving up halfway?"

The withered leaf butterfly had a kind of decadent beauty.

After the system finished complaining, it suddenly felt something was wrong.

...Since Xia Ge saw that butterfly, she hasn't said a word.

"Host?"

The system hesitated and called out.

No response.

"Host?!"
Xia Ge was just staring at the butterfly, her gaze empty and lifeless.

The butterfly moved and flew away freely. Xia Ge had been lazily leaning against the tree, but she instinctively wanted to stand up and catch the butterfly.

"Don't go."

Her feet slipped, and she felt a sudden weightlessness and dizziness. But the person who fell down lost even the instinct to use the Ghost Shadow Maze!

The system felt something was wrong. It was being controlled by something!

However, it couldn't bring Xia Ge back to consciousness. The moment the girl fell from the tree, it lost all perception.

In the last moment, Xia Ge didn't fall to the ground but instead fell into a warm embrace. At the same time, she heard a sweet and gentle voice.

Suddenly, a strange chill covered her body.

Xia Ge's pupils shrank as she watched the butterfly fall before her eyes and disappear into thin air.

"Don't go." Please don't disappear.

"...Good girl."

Then, the sky and earth turned dark.

= =

Chu Yao had finished her work for the day and it was already dark.

She pushed open the door to her study. The sky was starless and moonless, and the drizzle fell softly. Chu Yao looked up and saw a thin peach blossom branch growing under a dim lantern.

Chu Yao stared at the peach blossom branch and clicked her tongue.

The peach blossoms have bloomed.

- The peach blossoms on the Lingxi Peak haven't bloomed yet.

In April, the flowers in the world are in full bloom, and the peach blossoms in the mountain temple begin to bloom.

If someone wants to see the peach blossoms on Lingxi Peak, that person will probably have to wait a long time.

Just as she was thinking, a paper crane flew through the rain and delivered a letter to her. The crane was surrounded by spiritual light, and Chu Yao's eyes lit up slightly as she reached out her hand. The paper crane gently landed on her fingertips and left the letter in her hand before dissipating into spiritual light.
Translation:

She sent a paper crane with a message, which only the sender and receiver could see.

Chu Yao returned to her study and was about to open the letter when she heard hurried footsteps. She paused and tucked the letter into her sleeve. Soon, someone pushed the door open and spoke urgently, "Miss..."

It was the old housekeeper.

Chu Yao responded with a sound and rubbed the letter in her sleeve with her fingertips. "What's the matter?"

"The Evil Spirit Mountain has erupted," the old housekeeper's voice trembled with excitement. "The major families have already sent people there. Should we...?"

"I know about it," Chu Yao's voice was calm. "But it has nothing to do with us."

The old housekeeper was stunned and couldn't believe it. "Miss?!"

Were they going to let the ancient clothes demon slip away?

"I have a plan for this matter. You don't have to worry about it," Chu Yao said.

The emergence of the Evil Spirit Mountain was known throughout the world. Indeed, the ancient clothes demon was tempting, but...

There was always something suspicious about it.

"...," the old housekeeper sighed tiredly. "Miss, I know you are worried about Master's health, but this is a critical moment for the family's survival..."

If the Chu family could obtain two ancient clothes demons, they could completely turn the tide!

"It's precisely because it's a critical moment," Chu Yao's voice was calm and composed. "That we cannot act recklessly."

The candlelight flickered, and the girl's face was calm and composed, with a hint of the demeanor of a family head.

The old housekeeper fell silent for a moment, bowed his head, and respectfully said, "Yes."

The old housekeeper left the study, and his figure gradually disappeared into the distance. Chu Yao paused and took out the letter from her sleeve, opening it.

"Lingxi's peach blossoms haven't bloomed."

"Life is bitter."

The young man's handwriting was delicate and clear, and Chu Yao could even imagine the frown on his face when he wrote this sentence. "I seek but cannot obtain."
Chu Yao thought to herself, "This guy is really effeminate. It's just peach blossoms. It's not like he's desperately seeking them."

After a pause, she continued to think, "The peach blossoms on the mountain may not bloom, but in Chang'an City, the spring scenery is full of flourishing peach blossoms. If he really wants to see them..."

It's not impossible.

She kept reading, and as she did, she unconsciously tightened her grip on the letter.

"...A girl told me she likes me."

The young man wrote this down, seemingly hesitant. His pen paused for a long time, leaving a faint ink stain on the soft rice paper.

"I feel like I might like her too, but...it's too superficial."

The young man carefully chose his words, trying to express his conflicted feelings. "A reckless love will hurt both parties. There's a saying in our village, um..."

"Love that can't lead to marriage is just playing around even if you only hold hands."

"Although I'm outstanding, I'm an upright person who never plays around."

Chu Yao: "..."
