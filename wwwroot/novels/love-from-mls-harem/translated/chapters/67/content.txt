Xia Ge looked at the person in confusion, and under their finger pointing, she sat down obediently.

As she sat down, she felt a bit oppressed due to the height difference.

However, when Xia Ge came back to her senses and wondered why she had sat down obediently, she realized that the person she wanted to follow had already disappeared into the Heiyan Cave. Xia Ge felt anxious, but she didn't know the identity of the person in front of her, so she couldn't provoke them. She could only wait and see what they wanted to do, and react accordingly.

Just as Xia Ge was contemplating, the person holding her silently retracted their finger, which was wrapped in cloth, revealing a slender silhouette. They pointed to Xia Ge's sign that she hadn't put away yet, then to the small box containing the Bi Gu Dan, and slowly took out a bag of spirit stones from their pocket, handing it over to Xia Ge.

Xia Ge was stunned in place.

The meaning behind this was...

System: "Quickly take the money, he wants to buy your 'Immortal Dan'!"

Xia Ge: "..." Shut up.

Xia Ge hesitated for a moment, and decided to kindly remind the other person. She pointed to the price on the sign, "It's not... it's one hundred middle-grade spirit stones."

Although the black market was called the black market because it was full of people trying to make a quick profit, when it came down to it, Xia Ge felt a bit hesitant to sell the two pills for a hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones.

The person in the black cloak still didn't say anything, and maintained their original posture, obviously meaning that they understood.

Xia Ge: "..." This person...

Were they foolish and wealthy? They knew they were being ripped off, yet they still came over?

Seeing that the other person remained motionless, Xia Ge finally took the bag of spirit stones. As soon as she took it, she heard the long-awaited system prompt.

[Ding! Congratulations, host, for obtaining one hundred middle-grade spirit stones!]

...It was really just one hundred middle-grade spirit stones.

Seeing that she had taken the bag of spirit stones, the person in the cloak slightly leaned down, picked up the box containing the two pills from Xia Ge's black cloth, and then silently packed up their things and left.

Due to the fact that there were many people in black cloaks in the black market, the other person quickly disappeared into the crowd and was nowhere to be seen.

Xia Ge: "He's gone."

System: "Hmm."

Xia Ge: "Are there really so many people with too much money and no sense lately?"
System: "What's wrong?"

Xia Ge thought about their failed business earlier and couldn't help but say, "I don't think his business is doing well either."

The system replied seriously, "Yes, that's why you sold him the 'Immortal Pill'."

Xia Ge: "..."

System: "You see, his business is so bad, maybe that's all he has left."

Xia Ge: "..."

System: "Just kidding."

Xia Ge: "Anyway, he gave me the money, so it's mine! A deal is a deal!"

"Oh, wait! That guy-"

Xia Ge held her money bag and slapped her forehead. She didn't know whether to follow the guy or continue with her own plans.

"Forget it." Xia Ge paused and muttered to herself, "I came to the black market myself, why shouldn't he buy something too?"

She was too busy with her own affairs and didn't have time to think about anything else. Now that she had money, she should buy the materials first.

After walking around the black market, Xia Ge bought the puppet materials she wanted. She had a rough idea of the market prices of various puppet materials and knew that the currency used in the black market was spirit stones, but the fact that they were in denominations of a thousand was unexpected.

Because some of the materials for low-level puppets and some alchemy materials were common and easily available, buying them directly wouldn't raise suspicion.

But if she wanted to make a higher-level puppet, she would need to be careful with some of the materials, such as evil spirit mud and some other exotic things. However, Xia Ge had no plans to buy those things yet.

When she was buying materials, she saw a high-level puppet material, platinum bone, which could be used to make the puppet's bones unbreakable and indestructible.

Xia Ge was tempted.

But when she saw the price of three hundred medium-grade spirit stones, she gave up.

She couldn't afford it.

Buying the puppet materials had already cost her half of the one hundred medium-grade spirit stones she had, which might be considered a fortune among mortals, but in the alchemy, puppetry, and spirit artifact circles, one hundred medium-grade spirit stones was not much. It was just that the Qi Gathering Pill was too common, and Xia Ge selling it for a hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones was indeed a bit overpriced.

Just as Xia Ge was staring at the small platinum bone, someone gently tugged at her cloak. Xia Ge was startled, and her twenty-centimeter high heels almost caused her to stumble, but she quickly steadied herself and looked closely. She found that the one pulling her sleeve was a small dwarf wearing a white paper mask and standing only about half a meter tall.
Xia Ge's voice was serious: "Little puppet."

The system responded, "Hmm?"

Xia Ge was vaguely excited: "Is it shorter than me? About a meter shorter?"

The system was distressed: "Host, your shoes have a twenty-centimeter heel... Why don't you compare your height to the cursed wealth baby puppet?"

Xia Ge recalled the frog-faced figure that was about forty centimeters tall, expressionless. "That was a deformity, it's not the same."

The system: "..."

Is a fifty-centimeter dwarf not a deformity?! Do you think there are children in the black market?! They're all old monsters!!

The fifty-centimeter old monster was initially frightened by Xia Ge's fierce bronze mask, but soon realized it was just a mask. He silently lifted a piece of paper and handed it to her. Xia Ge pretended to be very tall and stooped down to take it. She took a look and saw that it was the auction list for the black market below.

"There will be very good items for sale tonight, I hope you can grace us with your presence." The little dwarf's voice was hoarse and old, like a several hundred-year-old man. Xia Ge got goosebumps on her arm from listening to him and cleared her throat. She lowered her voice and pretended to be very interested. "What kind of hidden treasures are there? Can you give me a hint?"

This little dwarf is really short.

Joyful.

"Ten copper coins, I'll tell you everything I know, thank you." The little dwarf was serious.

Xia Ge: "..." Are you not really an official representative? Is it fake?

Forget it, it's not expensive anyway. She was curious about what was being sold in the black market.

Xia Ge took out ten copper coins and gave them to him.

He took the money, lowered his voice, and looked secretive. "You crouch down, and I'll tell you."

Xia Ge crouched down, and the little dwarf leaned in close to her ear, looking excited. "Tonight's finale is... the heavenly courtesan from the capital! I heard she's exceptionally beautiful!"

Xia Ge: "..."

The system: "..."
Xia Ge smiled, "Can I still get a refund?"

The dwarf's mask trembled, "Once the money is received, there will be no refunds."

Xia Ge still smiled, her voice gentle.

"If I beat you up, will you refund me?"

The dwarf immediately tried to run away, but was caught by Xia Ge by the collar. He cried out, "It's forbidden to use violence or spiritual power in the black market! You will be caught, you will be caught!"

She lowered her voice, sinisterly, "I won't beat you up, I just want to play a game of hitting and being hit with you..."

She paused, and then gently laughed, "And, between a dwarf who escaped rent and is selling information here, and a legitimate seller who wants to play a game, who do you think the black market thugs will catch?"

The dwarf's body stiffened, "I, I, I..."

Ha, it really was a fake, but it worked out perfectly.

Xia Ge looked at the promotional page in her hand, which had the secret mark of the black market, and it was real.

In other words... selling information under the guise of distributing flyers and escaping rent?

Tsk, it looks like he's even poorer than her.

And...

So this is what it feels like to lift someone up, it's really satisfying. No wonder that guy surnamed Chu from Jianfeng likes to lift her up so much.

Xia Ge sighed, holding the dwarf, and said insincerely, "Let's play a game, throwing and being thrown sounds too boring, how about throwing and being smashed? "

She gestured, "Like 'whoosh', throw you up into the sky, and then 'bang', you fall to the ground and turn into ground meat... oh, don't worry, I have a lot of strength, I promise you won't turn into ground meat, be good, you won't turn into ground meat."

System: "..." Are you the devil?

"Waaah, I don't want to play a game! Hero! Brave warrior! Strong man!" The dwarf, lifted up by Xia Ge's 1.7 meter tall body, a meter off the ground, flailed his legs and his old voice suddenly changed, or rather, his true voice was exposed, a thin boyish voice, "I'll tell you another thing, I'll tell you another thing! Hero, let me down quickly! Let me down quickly, waaah..."

Xia Ge paused, feeling that her scare tactics were very effective, and satisfied, she put him down, then squatted down and spoke kindly, "Speak."

The dwarf, looking like he had just escaped death, crouched on the ground shivering for a while, then shook his legs and whispered, "Besides that child..."

Seeing Xia Ge's unfriendly gaze behind the mask, he hesitated for a moment, and his survival instinct made him swallow the word "prostitute", "...woman, it is said that there is another ancient clothes demon..."
"An ancient clothing demon?!"

This news was undoubtedly explosive.

Xia Ge was surprised in her heart, but her face remained calm. "There's an ancient clothing demon? Do you know its name?"

There were only a few ancient clothing demons that appeared in the Wind and Moon Continent, and each one took up a lot of space in the books. If an ancient clothing demon appeared here...

Which one would it be? The official clothing demon from the book or a wild one?

The dwarf could barely look at her bronze mask without feeling like an evil spirit had returned. He turned his face away and whispered, "...I heard it's called 'Soul Suppressing'."

Soul Suppressing?!

Xia Ge's eyes widened suddenly. The ancient clothing demon being auctioned off tonight in the black market was actually Soul Suppressing?!

How was this possible? Based on the clues and speculations she had, Soul Suppressing shouldn't be in the black market, right?!

No, something wasn't right!

But it wasn't impossible either. After all, the tomb of Lingxi Ancestor had been hundreds of years old, and it had been raided by tomb robbers and all sorts of things dozens of times. It was enough for Soul Suppressing to wander around in the human world!

Xia Ge suddenly stood up, scaring the dwarf three steps back. She took out ten copper coins from her pocket and handed them to him. "Thanks."

"Oh, no need to thank me! You must go and participate, and if there's one more person, I'll get a bonus..." The dwarf suddenly realized he had said too much and quickly shut up, laughing awkwardly before running away.

Xia Ge: "..."

It sounded like there was a bonus for one more person.

She really had no head for business. Even selling pills, she was afraid of losing money to others. No wonder some people could get rich overnight, while she couldn't even afford to eat.
