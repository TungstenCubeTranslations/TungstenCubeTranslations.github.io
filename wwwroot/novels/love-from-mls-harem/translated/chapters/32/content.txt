System: "The Ghost Dragon Jade is a special item, ordinary repair items cannot repair it."

Xia Ge: "What about special items?"

The system's tone was strange: "Host, for special items, you..." can't afford it.

Xia Ge immediately interrupted: "Okay, okay, I know. Don't say it."

It's really everywhere that you can feel the malice towards poor people.

After descending the mountain road past Ye Ze's house, the lights were off.

The system suddenly wondered: "He's leaving, why didn't you go back with him just now?"

Xia Ge shrugged: "He's so proud."

Saying those words, he probably would feel embarrassed.

It's better to let him go back alone to calm down.

Xia Ge returned to his room and casually closed the door. He took out the Ghost Dragon Jade with a missing corner from the small box under the bed.

The dragon jade was missing its right corner, with a warm touch and a fierce dragon shape.

-"Get accepted, get accepted into the Danfeng inner sect."

"Ah, it's really worrying." Xia Ge threw the jade aside, opened the points mall, and started flipping through the "Classical Gift Box". After flipping for a while, he found one that cost 300 points.

"【Surprise Gift Box】, no matter what's inside, it will make people feel extremely surprised when opened!"

Xia Ge stared at the gift box for a long time.

Just when the system thought Xia Ge was going to hoard points and spend them all, Xia Ge's hesitant voice rang out, "Xiao Kui, this gift box...could it be that...even if I put a piece of X inside, it will still...?"

The green light flashed before his eyes, and the points mall panel disappeared. The system decisively closed the points mall, its voice cold: "Host, it's late, you should go to sleep. If it's convenient, can you uninstall me? Please."

Xia Ge: "You're really unfeeling, Xiao Kui."

The system replied: "When you start speaking like a human, then I'll be more humane."
Xia Ge: "..."

The points mall was forcefully closed by the system, but Xia Ge, a night owl, still felt itchy to use it. However, seeing the indifferent expression on Xiao Kui's face, it was impossible to reopen the points mall.

Xia Ge then opened her skill panel.

Besides leveling up and gaining new skills, there weren't many changes. However, there was now a green button labeled "Lingering Marionette" next to her name. Xia Ge clicked on this sub-panel.

The data for the Lingering Marionette was displayed, but all the basic data was grayed out.

"Distance too far, in an uncontrollable state," Xia Ge was shocked. "Oh, there's still a distance range for this?"

"Of course," the system said coldly. "I thought a range of thirty li would be enough for you to wander around with it."

But who knew that Xia Ge would send the puppet thousands of miles away to the Demon Sect.

The system paused for a moment, inexplicably impressed. "Truly... impressive."

Xia Ge lamented, "Truly... a mistake."

The system replied, "Mutual understanding."

Xia Ge said, "No, no."

After their daily incomprehensible business conversation, Xia Ge closed the panel and felt deeply melancholic.

"But don't worry, as long as there's no puppeteer's white talisman masking its aura, you'll still sense it when it appears within thirty li of you."

The system said.

"Oh."

White Ren and White Luo were not fools. The thirty li radius around them was exactly the base camp of the Lingxi Peak. Would they come to the Lingxi Peak's base camp to fall into a trap?

Her Lingering Marionette seemed to be a waste.

Xia Ge glanced at the Ghost Dragon Jade on the table. She had thought it would be useful...

She had thought too simply.
The system couldn't help but speak up, "But, host, even in a controllable state, it seems like you can't control it now."

Controlled soul walking sound couldn't be used, and the SSS-level puppet here was equivalent to garbage for her.

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge calmly changed the subject, "Little puppet, what do you think about me using a glass-wood carving to make a gift box?"

System: "You don't have glass-wood though." How she evades reality.

Xia Ge tilted her head, "Glass-wood, it's very simple."

Three minutes later.

Back mountain.

Xia Ge, who returned to her old profession, wore black night clothes, a black scarf covering her face, and was very familiar with the road.

System: "..."

==

It was late at night.

The green curtain moved slightly.

-"So sad, so sad - so sad that I want to die -"

-"Who do you think you are..."

-"I... will wait for you..."

-"Ah -"

The piercing scream was heart-wrenching, and the feeling of suffocating pain passed by.

Gu Peijiu suddenly opened her eyes, but didn't get up, and her face showed no expression.

-Another nightmare.

The blurry scene, occasional clear words, and that empathetic, heart-wrenching feeling.
It had been many consecutive days.

Gu Peijiu got up and walked to the window, wearing a light and thin single garment. The peach blossoms in the white porcelain small bottle on the table had already withered. Several bright red hawthorns were placed next to a green hawthorn, looking particularly cute and eye-catching under the moonlight shining through the green curtain.

The girl in the snow-white single garment picked up the green hawthorn, and her gaze softened slightly.

"Senior Sister, drink more alcohol. You won't have nightmares if you get drunk!"

The moonlight slightly blurred.

"...Alcohol."

The girl's long eyelashes drooped slightly.

But tonight, she was destined to be sleepless.

The next day.

With the upgraded version of Ghost Shadow Maze, Xia Ge finally sneaked into the back mountain and dug pits all night long without anyone noticing.

Unfortunately, the results were minimal.

At the hour of the hare.

The deepest darkness before dawn. Xia Ge sneaked back to her room with a bunch of weeds in her arms.

She threw a bunch of all sorts of spiritual plants such as the Lingxi Grass and Fuyao Grass on the table, feeling incredibly unbelievable, "Where is the Luli Wood? Why is it gone? Why?"

She dug almost three feet deep outside the periphery of the back mountain with Ghost Shadow Maze, but still failed to find a single Luli Wood.

In order to not return empty-handed, she could only bring back some familiar spiritual plants. But she only knew a few, so the results were minimal.

Unbelievable!

The system tried to comfort her, "It's okay... these... spiritual plants can still be sold for some points. The point mall accepts them."

Xia Ge reluctantly cheered up, "How many points can they sell for?"

The system glanced at them, "...20."

Xia Ge: "..."
"Oh, so she dug all night in the back mountain and dug out twenty pads?"

"Twenty percent of a 'surprise gift box'?"

"Society, society."

"I lost."

"Despair.jpg"

"But despair is useless. Looking at the sky, Xia Ge changed her night clothes into coarse clothes, sold all the stolen goods for points, and transformed from a thief to a righteous outer disciple of Lingxi Danfeng."

"Okay, let's go to Suxi."

"The system unexpectedly said, 'So early?'"

"Xia Ge said, 'But I am an excellent No. 88 outer disciple of Danfeng! My senior sister will be very moved to see me so early.'"

"If you fail in the thief world, you must succeed in the workplace!"

"From now on, study hard and make progress every day!"

When Gu Peijiu finished inspecting the morning class and was ready to go to Suxi, she saw Ye Ze.

The young man was wearing a well-fitted Danfeng plain clothes, his red hairband tied neatly, and his lowered eyebrows were pleasing to the eye. "Senior sister."

Gu Peijiu paused. "What's the matter?"

Since the last time she recommended him to Jianfeng, Gu Peijiu had given him three days off. That was why Ye Ze could leisurely wait for Xia Ge in the Suxi Dan Pavilion yesterday afternoon.

"I hope... to enter Jianfeng after the Danfeng entrance exam." The young man lowered his head. "I hope senior sister can help me."

Recalling what happened yesterday afternoon in Suxi, Gu Peijiu easily understood his thoughts.

After a moment of contemplation, Gu Peijiu still asked, "Why?"

"Senior sister." Ye Ze raised his eyes and looked at the girl in red and white maple clothes with a serious expression. "I lost both my parents at the age of six and have no relatives."
Ye Zewei clenched his fists slightly, as if recalling some painful scene. He closed his eyes and said, "My late parents taught me that a friend in need is a friend indeed."

"Please, Senior Sister, help me," he continued.

A friend in need?

Gu Peijiu was a little surprised, but after some thought, she nodded slightly. "Okay."

If it had to be this way, she could inform Chang Lan. It wouldn't hurt.

"Thank you, Senior Sister," the young man bowed his head and left without saying another word.

Gu Peijiu shook her head and let it go.

But she couldn't help but wonder, Ye Zewei...

Ye?

Gu Peijiu frowned slightly, watching the young man's back as he left for a while.

Wasn't he from the Ye family, which had gained great fame but was massacred overnight a few years ago?

The Su Xi Dan Ge was not far away. Gu Peijiu looked at the sky and decided to put this matter aside for now. She silently descended the mountain and returned with a basket of steamed buns. Taking a shortcut, she arrived at the Su Xi Dan Ge in no time. It was just the agreed-upon time for their meeting when the sun was rising in the east.

The Su Xi River was clear, and the cicadas were chirping softly. A few clusters of hydrangeas were blooming. Gu Peijiu looked up and saw that the door of the Dan Ge was half-open.

... Did that little rascal come so early today?

Gu Peijiu was a little surprised. She pushed the door gently and saw that the Dan Ge was bathed in warm sunlight from the open window. The little rascal was sitting cross-legged on a cushion, his head resting on the desk, sound asleep with a book of red pills under his arm. Half of the pages were exposed, and they were circled with ink by a brush, showing the order and technique of throwing herbs into the pill furnace, with detailed notes.

Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the precautions she had given him a few days ago.


Word for word translation:

Word for word translation:

"Without missing a word, clear and distinct.

Yesterday she remembered that Xia Wuyin and Ye Ze went back with nothing but a green pill. Yesterday, when she looked at this alchemy book, it was still blank, but today it was filled with notes and annotations.

And looking at the half-dried ink, it could only have been done by him this morning.

Gu Peijiu glanced at the notes on the alchemy book.

Some things she only said once, and some difficult ones were just skimmed over, but this little trickster remembered them all clearly in the alchemy book.

He was a clever child, but too clever for his own good.

Gu Peijiu put down the basket, "Xia Wuyin."

Buns get cold if left out too long, she couldn't let him sleep.

"...Um..."

Xia Ge felt dizzy and only vaguely heard someone speaking in her mind.

-"Lost road...unknown return..."

-"White bones lamenting...waiting for your return..."

"Xia Wuyin."

A clear and cold female voice, like pearls falling on a jade plate, pleasant to the ear.

The scent of sandalwood filled the air.

"...Don't make noise..."

Xia Ge muttered and changed her position to continue sleeping, her left face almost touching the other half of the alchemy book.

Gu Peijiu reached out to touch Xia Ge's head, but her movements were a bit slow. The boy's left half of his face was still firmly pressed against the ink-dried alchemy book.

Gu Peijiu stared at the boy's right face, which was covered in ink marks, for a long time, and for a moment, she forgot to call him again.

He was sleeping soundly.

The girl in the red and white maple dress paused for a moment and lifted the white cloth on the basket."
The aroma of the steamed buns wafted through the air, dispelling the haunting nightmares in an instant. The hunger pangs from skipping breakfast were ever present, but the tantalizing scent of the buns proved too much for the drowsiness to overcome. Xia Ge suddenly opened her eyes, fierce and alert like a wolf!

"Hey! Steamed buns!"
