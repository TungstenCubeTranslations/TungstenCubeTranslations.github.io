Meanwhile.

Xia Ge was squatting on the back mountain, learning to play the flute.

[Control Soul Walking]

A trace of blood was wandering on the white jade flute. Xia Ge was playing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" on the flute.

The guardian of the back mountain was happily jumping and dancing to the rhythm of the song.

System: "…If you let them dance like this in front of the ancestor's grave, the ancestor will be angry."

Xia Ge shamelessly replied: "No, I think the ancestor would be very pleased to see her disciple diligently inheriting her family's unique skills."

The blue lost deer lay elegantly under the tree, looking a bit lazy.

The rhythm of the song was light, cheerful and lively. After Xia Ge finished playing, the eyes of the guardian below became stiff again. They stopped dancing and started wandering around.

Once the music stopped, they would lose control.

"…It's really impossible." Xia Ge felt a bit sad. "Only by borrowing the magical power of this flute can I barely control these things to dance. I don't know how the demonic cult controls the demonic puppets. It's really scary."

"Because the demonic cult has a flute called 'White Bone Sorrow'."

The girl's voice was faint. "So they can control the demonic puppets more easily."

Before Gu Peijiu finished speaking, the beautiful jade flute slipped silently from Xia Ge's hand and made a "thud" sound as it hit a stone. She squatted on the tree, her whole body stiff, and her mind went blank.

Almost the next second, "Ghost Shadow Maze" was activated. Xia Ge turned into a ghostly figure and grabbed the flute on the ground. She was about to run away.

As she ran, she felt the guardian's anger and instinctively wanted to attack her. Gu Peijiu glanced sideways, and the spiritual energy around her floated and instantly turned into ropes that tied up those restless guardians. At the same time, the girl's figure flashed, and Xia Ge, who was about to slip away, was caught by the collar. Gu Peijiu's voice was faint: "Why are you running?"

Xia Ge: "…"

Xia Ge: "I didn't run! I didn't do anything! It wasn't me! It was, it was, it was… it was it, it played it!! It was all played by it!!"

Xia Ge's hand pointing at the lost deer was shaking.

The lost deer tilted its head and looked at her innocently with watery eyes.

System: "…" A deer playing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"? Are you kidding me?!
Gu Peijiu grabbed her collar, squinted her eyes with a hint of amusement, but remained composed, "Oh?"

Xia Ge struggled to speak as if she was dying, "It really wasn't me. I told you this deer is amazing. It can sing, dance, and even party at the gravesite. Senior sister, you must have never seen anything like it before--"

"If you let me go, I can show you," she pleaded.

The young girl was wearing a patched night robe and holding a jade flute, attempting to struggle for her life.

The system: "…"

A strange wind blew past them.

However, the next moment, Gu Peijiu's pupils shrank slightly as she turned her head sharply towards the direction of Sword Peak!

There was a strange aura carried by the wind blowing from Sword Peak.

At the same time, several guardians who sensed human presence stumbled over.

She grabbed Xia Ge's collar and brought her into her arms, and with a few flashes, they arrived at the foot of Dan Peak. "Go back," she ordered.

Gu Peijiu was fast, and Xia Ge's brain had not yet reacted to what had happened before she and her flute were already in a different place.

Xia Ge: "…"

After Gu Peijiu finished speaking, she turned to leave, seemingly having an urgent matter. Xia Ge didn't hesitate to hug her and said, "Senior sister, don't go!!"

Gu Peijiu stopped and looked at her sideways. "…What do you want?"

Xia Ge looked up with a guilty conscience and said, "I just want to be with senior sister. Wherever you go, I'll go too!"

Under the clear moonlight, the young girl's face was white and tender, and her pair of cat-like eyes were very charming.

For a moment, Gu Peijiu thought that if this child wanted her life, she would give it to her.

A crazy thought.

- As long as it was her request.

She could promise anything.
Gu Peijiu was silent for a moment before saying, "There may be danger."

Xia Ge let go of Gu Peijiu's sleeve and patted his chest, saying, "I will protect you, senior sister!! I'm super awesome!"

Although she knew it was just a joke, Gu Peijiu looked at those clear cat eyes and the crazy thoughts dissipated slightly, replaced by a pervasive warmth.

Gu Peijiu's lips curved slightly.

Very gentle.

Xia Ge was pleased, thinking there was hope. She made plans in her mind to follow senior sister to see what she was doing, then perform well and become a good youth, and then casually ask senior sister about her thoughts on "A Little Star" causing everyone to dance at the ancestor's grave...

The next moment.

Gu Peijiu said, "No."

By the time Xia Ge came back to her senses, she couldn't even see Gu Peijiu's shadow.

Xia Ge: "..."

Starlight filled the air.

Xia Ge silently took the lovesick knot out of her hair, her smile particularly gentle.

The lovesick knot trembled in her hand and was about to slip away, but Xia Ge flicked her finger and wrapped its little tail around her finger.

The little lovesick trembled slightly, then began to coil around and rub against Xia Ge's palm, looking very excited.

System: "...It looks like it really likes you."

Xia Ge acted as if it was nothing. "Hmm, I like myself too."

System: "..."

Then Xia Ge expressionlessly tied the little lovesick to a maple tree with three knots.

Xia Ge said, "You're happy to keep giving away my location to Tian Zhuling every time, aren't you?"

The little lovesick tried to deny it.

Xia Ge pretended to leave, and the lovesick immediately nodded its "head" like a garlic press.
"It's all my fault, a thousand and ten thousand mistakes, all my fault!" 

Xia Ge nodded in satisfaction, "Yes, so now it's your turn." 

Xiao Xiangsi looked confused and tilted her body. 

Xia Ge gave a cunning smile, "Where is Tian Zhuling now?" 

= = 

As Ye Ze was about to pass through the persimmon forest with his sword, he met Chu Yi. 

The little girl stood elegantly in front of the persimmon forest, surrounded by silver butterflies. At first glance, her almond eyes, black pupils, red lips, white teeth, and snow-white skin made her look like a fairy. 

"Where are you going?" 

Chu Yi tilted her head and spoke sweetly. 

Ye Ze looked at her silently, holding the Wenqing sword in his hand. His pitch-black eyes were calm and still. "Move aside." 

The ghost dragon in the Guilong jade around his waist wrapped around his arm holding the sword, with its front paws climbing on his shoulders and its golden copper bell eyes staring at Chu Yi. Except for the person who awakened it, no one else could see it. 

"Weren't you in no hurry?" Chu Yi put her small hand behind her back and twisted it together, with a smile in her eyes. "Why did you suddenly..." 

Ye Ze interrupted her, "You already knew?" 

He thought of something that Chu Yi wanted to tell him when she came to find him before, but he firmly refused at the time. 

For a moment, Ye Ze suddenly hated his stubbornness. If he had known earlier, if he had known earlier... 

"Yes. I wanted to tell you earlier," Chu Yi tilted her head and said, "but you didn't want to listen." 

He tightly gripped the Wenqing sword, his heart surging. In the end, he could only press his lips tightly, hold the sword, and walk past Chu Yi without saying a word, leaving only one sentence. 

"Don't tell anyone you've seen me." 

The young man walked past her, with a cold and hateful look in his eyes, step by step, like a Shura from hell.
Chu Yi suddenly said, "Wait."

Ye Ze didn't stop.

"If you don't listen, I guarantee you will regret it," Chu Yi turned around and blinked her eyes, "Really."

Ye Ze took a few steps, then stopped.

At the entrance of the mountain prison, the patrols were guarding closely.

"How come it's you again?" The guard saw Chu Yi and frowned, "Are you related to someone inside?"

Chu Yi blinked her eyes and shook the water blue token, "Hmm, maybe we're related..."

The guard widened his eyes.

Chu Yi's smiling expression suddenly became quiet, her black eyes seemed ghostly, and she said word by word, "I lied to you."

The guard: "..."

She's crazy.

The guard was captivated by her black eyes, and for a moment, he forgot to check the authenticity of her token.

Chu Yi said, "Why don't you open the door?"

The guard snorted, turned around, and took out the key.

Chu Yi glanced at the key, and her fingertips moved slightly. The silver butterfly, which was the signal, immediately flew up. Ye Ze, who had been quietly lurking in the thorny forest, saw the silver butterfly on the branch fly up and his eyes flashed - this was the moment!

The next moment, the dragon's black mist-like body that was wrapped around Ye Ze dissipated, the wind changed slightly, and the guard holding the key felt something was wrong. He turned around to check on the little girl behind him, but as soon as he lifted his eyes, he was instantly met with a pair of deep golden pupils. He opened his mouth and was about to shout, but his throat seemed to be mute, and he couldn't say anything. Then he rolled his eyes and fainted.

Other guards who sensed something was wrong hadn't turned their heads yet, but were met with a pair of golden dragon pupils. In the moment they saw those pupils, it was as if their souls were taken away, and they fell down stiffly, one after another. The rows of guards were like dominoes that had been knocked down, without exception.

The smell of the wind was full of eerie aura, and then it spread out.

The prison door was wide open!

"I'll help you until here." Chu Yi laughed lightly, and casually threw away the water blue token in her hand. In the moment it was thrown away, the token turned into a silver butterfly, fluttering and scattered in the air.
"As for success or failure, it depends on yourself."

The moonlight on this night was exceptionally clear.

The woman in the cell hugged a bell, weighed down by chains. She gazed quietly at the bright moon outside the small window, her thoughts in turmoil before gradually calming down.

Where is the meaning of life?

Qin Yue wondered.

The bell in her hand was silent, quiet and still.

She lowered her head and lightly kissed the bell.

Her child...

She wanted to see her again, even if it was just once.

But at this moment--

A cold and ghostly aura, filled with intense killing intent and malice, rushed towards her!

"Clang!"

"Boom--"

The cage made of dark iron was cut in half by a sword!

In the midst of the flying dust, a young man dressed in black with a cold sword in his hand looked at the woman locked in the cage, his lips pressed into a thin line, his pitch-black eyes boiling with hatred!

Qin Yue.

It was this face, this face that disturbed his peace day after day!

...Qin Yue!

The young man pursed his lips and said nothing, lifting his sword high towards the woman. The sword, with no shine and full of chilling intent, seemed capable of destroying everything.

There was nothing to say.
"I just want her dead!"

Qin Yue looked at the unexpected guest, her eyes widened suddenly, her pupils narrowing. She instinctively tightened her grip on the bell, a chilling fear enveloping her body in an instant.

She was going to die.

This unknown boy, with an unknown surname.

He was definitely going to kill her!!

= =

The stars twinkled.

Not far from the mountain prison, Su Chan sat on a tree branch, her red dress fluttering as she played with the red tassel on her bone flute. Her slender and fair hands exuded an unexpected eerie aura, and her narrow eyes glinted with a cold smile.

She was like a red lotus blooming on the tree, alluringly beautiful.

Feeling that Gu Peiju had already arrived, she chuckled softly, "It seems that I don't need to go over there anymore."

Li Liu half-knelt on the ground and said, "The leader is wise."

"People always crave life and fear death," she carefully put away the bone flute, smiling in a nonchalant manner. "Even the bravest hero will covet life if they have something to live for."

However, the fact that Ye Ze could force his way to the mountain prison so quickly was the most unexpected thing for her.

But it was also in line with her expectations.

Qin Yue was a smart person.

In the deep night, the curve of Su Chan's lips became more and more evident.
