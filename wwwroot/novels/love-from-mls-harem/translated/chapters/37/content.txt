Before Xia Ge could explain herself, a dazzling golden light suddenly appeared on the ground, and two huge three-headed puppet beasts suddenly appeared on both sides of the formation!

Xia Ge didn't know if it was a teleportation of the formation or what, but she quickly gripped her sickle and exclaimed, "Oh my god, is the old ancestor so stingy? I really can't afford it!"

The system said, "Shut up."

The puppet beasts had three heads and four hooves, with black stone eyes and iron teeth. The hair on their bodies was made of an unknown material and stood on end, making them look particularly terrifying.

One of the three-headed beasts on the right side scratched the ground with its right front paw, then gathered its hind legs and pounced towards Xia Ge with lightning speed!

Xia Ge didn't try to withstand the attack when she saw that the formation in the room was the kind she knew. She used her Ghost Shadow technique to dodge to the right side of the three-headed beast, which missed her and turned around to attack her again. Xia Ge swung her sickle towards the beast's head from behind.

The system interrupted, "There are so many heads, why don't you kick one like a ball?"

However, the beast was not slow to react. Its tail flicked and it sensed Xia Ge's location. One of its heads turned to face her and its black stone eyes turned red. At the same time, it opened its mouth and a column of hot flames shot towards Xia Ge. The other three-headed mechanical beast also moved, jumping up and blocking her escape route.

Xia Ge's mouth curled up slightly and she changed the shape of her sickle. She broke off the top end that was connected to the sickle blade, and the chain rattled as she swung it like a fan. The spinning sickle collided with the flames, but Xia Ge was pushed back by the force of the flames. She was about to hit the wall next to the entrance of the stone passage.

She quickly used the sickle to hook onto the wall, then used her Ghost Shadow technique to spin in mid-air and land on the ground. She then slashed the golden lines of the formation on the ground with her sickle, breaking them into two.

The two three-headed beasts were suddenly frozen in place and stood still for a second. Xia Ge said, "Hehehe, goodbye!" and turned around to run into the stone passage.

As she had expected, it was a formation puppet. She had been interested in the formations here before. The male lead in "Endless Love in the Wind and Moon" had also encountered many of these formation puppets. These things couldn't be fought with a war of attrition. They were born from the formation, and the formation gathered spiritual energy to give them power. As long as the formation was intact, they would become stronger and stronger.

The stone tablet that she had accidentally touched was the temporary switch for the formation puppet. There were two conditions for opening the formation puppet: someone touching the lines of the formation, or someone touching the stone tablet. There was no way to close it, but there was a way to restrain it.

As long as the lines of the formation were destroyed, the formation could not gather spiritual energy to make them stronger, and they would stop moving when their spiritual energy was exhausted.
"Roar-"

Two three-headed beasts behind her roared angrily, and then one after the other rushed into the stone passage. However, because their bodies were too huge, the entire beast got stuck at the entrance of the passage after taking only a few steps. It could only let out a sharp howl and then spewed out a stream of angry flames towards Xia Ge who was running ahead.

"Roar-"

The scorching hot flames rushed towards her like crazy from behind. Xia Ge's Ghost Shadow Trail was almost at its limit, and she ran forward with her scythe in hand, howling all the way with her eyes closed as if her butt was on fire.

"Ah, oh heavens, oh earth, ancestor, ancestor, please show yourself, your loyal 556th generation disciple, Xia Wuyin, the outer sect disciple of Danfeng Peak No. 88, is here to burn paper for you-"

System: "..." Burn your sister!

Fortunately, Xia Ge was very fast, and the flames behind her were not close enough. The stone passage twisted and turned, and after several turns, when she could no longer feel the danger of the scorching heat behind her, and could only faintly hear the angry roars of the two three-headed beasts, Xia Ge finally breathed a sigh of relief, slowed down, and finally stopped at a steady pace.

"Hoo...hoo...so tired."

Xia Ge threw away her scythe, leaned against the wall, and gasped for breath, then slowly slid down and sat on the ground. "Damn...this stone passage is really long."

Xia Ge's Ghost Shadow Trail had only been pushed to the limit a few times, and every time she did, she felt the pain of running two kilometers under the scorching sun during a college sports exam.

Xia Ge felt that she had recovered, and while panting, she looked around.

"Really...terrifying."

The stone passage was the same as before, still illuminated by night pearls every three steps. However, this time there were no murals on the walls, but sets of formations that Xia Ge could not understand were drawn between two night pearls.

Xia Ge looked around with her scythe in her arms, and it seemed that there was no danger. Suddenly, her mind became active again.

"Hey, Xiao Gui, do you recognize this formation on the wall?"

System: "I don't recognize it."

Xia Ge: "You're useless, you're so useless, you don't even recognize this."

System: "..." Do you recognize it?!!

Xia Ge rubbed her chin, "This formation in the resting place of Lingxi Mountain's Lingxi Ancestor, it seems very valuable no matter how you think about it...oh!"

Xia Ge pounded her hand, and her eyes suddenly lit up, "Could this be the huge sum of money that the ancestor wants to give me?!!"

System: "No..." You're thinking too much!
Xia Ge looked around and found that there were many formations, but they were just repeating the carving of three sets of formations. Holding her sickle, she walked forward while memorizing the three sets of formations, which were not very difficult and soon became familiar to her.

"When I go back, I must check the book," Xia Ge rubbed her chin. "The formations carved in the tomb of Lingxi Ancestor must be amazing."

The system replied, "The formations carved in the tomb are usually for soul calming."

Xia Ge refused to accept reality, "No, shut up. I tend to believe that it is an unknown and peerless divine formation."

The system said, "..." As long as you are happy.

"In novels, it's always written like this," Xia Ge held her sickle and walked forward, trying to prove to the system the possibility that it was a peerless divine formation. "Although the protagonist is Ye Ze, who is a coward, I am not a lucky E..."

"Wu wu wu..."

Xia Ge's voice stiffened slightly.

A small, choked sobbing sound came from the end of the stone passage.

"...Right?" Xia Ge asked.

The system tried to remain calm, "No."

Xia Ge also tried to act as if nothing had happened, "Me neither..."

"Wu wu wu wu..."

Xia Ge was unable to say the words "me neither" and felt goosebumps all over her body. She trembled and tried to touch the ghost dragon jade around her waist, but found that it was not there. She suddenly remembered that she had dropped it when fighting against the enchanted puppet.

For a moment, Xia Ge felt cold sweat all over her back.

"Little puppet, I think it's better to go back the way we came," Xia Ge said nervously.

The system was angry, "You want to run away from a tomb and not see any ghosts? How brave you are!"

Xia Ge said, "It's different. This is not someone else's tomb, it's my ancestor's!"


System: "Who is your ancestor? If it's your ancestor, what are you afraid of!!!"

Xia Ge choked for a moment.

She wasn't afraid of her ancestors, but she was afraid of ghosts! Even ghost ancestors would be scary!!

"In the deep forest, you see deer; in the deep grave, you see ghosts."

"It's impossible to go back the way we came," the system said. "The two three-headed puppet beasts are still blocking the way. Can you defeat them? And even if you do, there's no way out."

The faint sound of crying still came from the other side.

In a moment of righteousness, Xia Ge said, "If I don't go to hell, who will? Little puppet, let's move forward!"

"....Why are your legs trembling?" the system asked.

Xia Ge: "...."

Finally, Xia Ge took heavy steps, feeling that this section of the stone path was particularly long.

Passing through the winding bright stone path, Xia Ge arrived at the second stone chamber and immediately saw the weeping woman.

The instigator was dreamlike and Xia Ge was momentarily stunned.

Bright night pearls decorated the stone chamber. The woman wore a gorgeous red robe with wide sleeves covering her face. Her black hair was tied up with a red hairband, and three strands hung down her shoulder. The golden hairpin on her forehead glimmered, her eyebrows arched slightly, and there were traces of tears in the corners of her eyes. She sobbed, covering her mouth with her red sleeve. Her whole body lay in front of the next stone path, and her red robe flowed like a wedding dress, beautiful and eerie.

As if sensing someone approaching, she looked up, her narrow eyes slightly slanted, with three parts of coquettishness and panic in her tearful eyes. "Who? - Where did the little gentleman come from?"

What a beauty, but this is someone's tomb. Is it inappropriate to wear red?

No... that's not the point.

Trembling, Xia Ge pointed at her with the sickle and asked, "Are you a human or a ghost?"

The woman seemed to be frightened by the sickle. She trembled slightly, and tears overflowed from her beautiful narrow eyes. "Sir, why do you come up here to meet me with a weapon?"

"..."

Whether she's a human or a ghost, Xia Ge didn't know. But if she doesn't come up here to meet a weapon, does that mean they're sisters?

"Little sir, please don't misunderstand. I'm not a ghost," the beauty sobbed. "I'm a bride-to-be from the Mo family village at the foot of the mountain. I dreamed of a blue deer at night, and when I woke up, I was here."
"...Mo Family Village? Blue Deer? Deer? Lost Deer?"

"Master, am I still dreaming? Where am I?" The beauty tried to stand up, her fiery red wedding dress slightly moving with her movements. She widened her eyes, her black ink-like pupils reflecting the light of night pearls, innocent yet enchanting. She took a step towards him, and Xia Ge jumped back as if he had been electrocuted. "You, you, don't come closer!! You... you stay there and don't move!! If you come any closer, I'll... I'll hit you!"

The beauty seemed a little sad, standing still in her place, her eyes brimming with tears. "Master, don't be afraid, I'm not an evil spirit."

Just because she said she wasn't an evil spirit, does that mean she isn't one? Just because she says she's from Mo Family Village, does that make her from there? Just because she says she was brought here by a deer, does that mean she's a deer? She even claimed to be the legendary Lingxi Old Ancestor in her past life! Is she really?!
