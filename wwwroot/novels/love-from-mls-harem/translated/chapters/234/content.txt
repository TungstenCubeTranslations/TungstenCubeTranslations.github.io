However, that person eventually walked away.

Further and further away.

Perhaps, they would never come back again.

Qin Yue climbed up the mountain and saw the Pure Soul Bead. The black and white Pure Soul Bead was no longer as pure as before. She sighed lightly and picked up the bead with her hand.

It was icy cold to the touch.

But in the next moment, a dazzling white light flashed and Qin Yue suddenly closed her eyes!

The brilliant white light lit up the sky in an instant.

-- You have to believe that time can heal everything.

-- "Become the person you truly want to be."

The girl in red looked up at the sky, and her dark hair turned into a pale snowy color without her noticing. It contrasted with her skin, which was as transparent as white, and her black pupils turned into translucent snow color.

All living beings kneeled down, and the brilliant white light on Qianhun Peak illuminated the sky. Thunder and lightning flashed in the sky, as if welcoming the return of a god.

The news of the theft of Chang Family's Skyward Radiance caused a stir in the city. When Chang Ran returned to the Chang Family, he felt frustrated no matter how he thought about it.

But there was nothing he could do.

Chang Lan respectfully stood downstairs with no expression on his jade-like face, but he was obviously indispensable - he was the protagonist of the wedding.

"How's the preparation going?" Chang Ran took a sip of tea and asked, calming down.

He was asking about the wedding.

"It's almost ready," Chang Lan replied, bowing his head.

"...Alright, you can go now." Chang Ran took a deep breath and waved his hand to dismiss him.

Chang Lan looked up and wanted to say something, but hesitated for a moment and said nothing, then turned and left.

Chang Ran knew what he wanted to ask.
The radiance of the sky has disappeared, and the Chu family is not foolish. Tomorrow's wedding banquet will certainly not go smoothly.

But until now, there has been no movement, and it is not known what kind of tricks they are playing.

Thinking of Chu Yi's attitude when she came over that day, Chang Ren narrowed his eyes slightly.

"With me here," the ominous voice said, "you don't have to worry."

Chang Ren asked, "Have you already rested?"

The ominous voice said, "That day, I devoured the souls of several people..."

The ominous voice was obviously referring to the day of the Heroes Gathering.

Chang Ren was shocked, "What?!"

Although the people summoned to the Heroes Gathering were not a match for Gu Peijiu, they were still important figures. To have something happen at the gathering he organized...

"With me here, what are you worried about?" the ominous voice said, "Although their souls are not as strong as hers, they are still powerful enough."

Chang Ren tried to calm himself down. The more critical the situation was, the less he could afford to lose his composure. In any case, if something went wrong, he could just shift all the blame onto that little demon girl.

Chang Ren calmed down and then realized that the ominous voice was speaking with too much confidence. He asked, "What do you want to do?"

"Although their souls are not as strong as hers, they are still powerful," the ominous voice said with some satisfaction and a hint of creepiness. "If something happens tomorrow, I can lend myself to you."

Chang Ren remained calm and asked, "What did you say?"

He didn't want to have anything to do with this evil thing!

"You have lost the radiance of the sky, but the Chu family still has the Chu Blade Sacrificial Spirit. Whether you want it or not, it's up to you," the ominous voice said, sneering.

Chang Ren's soul was not something it necessarily wanted.

It just wanted to use this person to return to that person's body.

That was a higher-level soul, the source of its birth, and the instinct of the Heavenly Dao to kill. It could get even stronger power and killing desire from her!

Chang Ren suddenly remembered something and asked, "How can you devour the souls of living people?"
The ominous laughter of Huoming echoed, "Because I have become stronger..."

Although stopped by Gu Peiju, it still obtained the ability to devour human souls from Xiaga.

Devouring souls... and making them...

Changren's gaze was a bit strange for a moment.

Huoming leaned against his ear and whispered, "You need me..."

The voice was faintly tempting.

This night was not peaceful.

In a certain mansion.

"Husband, you're finally home. The Martial Arts Tournament is really too dangerous. You shouldn't have gotten involved. Let me see if you're injured?"

A beautiful concubine with a delicate and charming appearance stepped forward to welcome the man who had returned.

The man's movements were shaky, as if he had drunk hundreds of pounds of alcohol. His eyes were dull and he was supported by the servants. He fell directly onto the concubine, pressing her down with force.

The concubine who was pressed down was stunned for a moment, not knowing whether to be happy or upset. "Husband, are you too tired? Please get up first, and I'll make you a cup of tea..."

As she spoke, she gestured for the people around her to help him up. However, she suddenly realized that something was wrong. The expressions of the servants around her were dull, with a faint red glow in their eyes.

The concubine was not stupid. She immediately felt that something was wrong and tried to get up. However, she was suddenly grabbed by the neck!

She saw her husband, whom she had joyfully welcomed, with eyes as red as a demon, and his face was extremely dull. He said word by word, "Give... me..."

The concubine couldn't breathe and gradually suffocated. Then, he twisted her neck!

Blood was everywhere.

= =

Xiaga suddenly opened her eyes, and cold sweat was faintly visible on her forehead.

Her senior sister hugged her, and when she moved, Gu Peiju also woke up. "What's wrong?"

The moonlight was cold, and Xiaga's lips were slightly pale. "I... seem to have had a bad dream."
Gu Peijiu lightly snapped her fingers, and the candle on the table lit up. She wiped her sweat and asked, "What did you dream about?"

The contents of the dream were already a bit blurry, but the strong smell of blood was unforgettable.

Xia Ge said, "...there was a lot of blood."

Gu Peijiu held her and whispered, "Don't be afraid."

After the disturbance, Xia Ge couldn't sleep anymore. She murmured, "Chu Yao is getting married tomorrow. Ye Ze said he would go, I don't know why, but I feel a bit..."

She seemed to not know how to continue, her eyes dimmed.

Gu Peijiu asked, "Feel a bit what?"

Xia Ge avoided her gaze and clenched her fists, "I won't let Chu Yao marry those people from the Chang family!"

Gu Peijiu touched her hair and gently released her soothing aura, "Hmm, she won't."

Xia Ge was uneasy.

Only when she felt uneasy would she say such things to encourage herself.

"So, let's get a good night's sleep first."

Xia Ge grabbed the soft hem of her clothes and found an excuse, "...I'm afraid of oversleeping."

She didn't dare to sleep, afraid of having another nightmare like just now.

It was too scary.

Gu Peijiu said, "You won't, I'm here."

"..." Xia Ge looked at her.

Gu Peijiu slightly curved her lips. "Don't you trust me?"

Xia Ge closed her eyes and rested her head on her chest.

Perhaps she was the person she trusted the most in the world.

This time, she didn't have any more nightmares.
Peaceful and calm, the night passed by and the sky brightened.

However, Gu Peijiu didn't fall back asleep. She felt the dark magic in the air getting stronger and her eyes narrowed slightly.

Firecrackers were heard throughout every corner of Chang'an. As the eldest daughter of the Chu family, Chu Qianxun's wedding was naturally grand and magnificent, almost comparable to a ten-mile-long red wedding procession.

The Chang family, also draped in red silk, was bustling with activity. Although many people who had participated in the Battle of Heroes despised the Chang family's behavior, there were still many who attended the wedding - after all, face-saving measures still had to be taken.

"Where's the bride?"

"She's still on her way..."

Constantine was also dressed in festive attire, drinking tea and smiling. Beside him was his plump wife, who was also sipping tea.

Someone whispered something in Constantine's ear, and his expression changed slightly, with a slight furrow of his brows.

Someone offered a toast and said, "Constantine, don't worry too much. It's not your fault that the Clothes Demon stole your precious treasure. Just relax. The Clothes Demon won't be able to act so arrogantly for long."

"It's a big day, we should be happy!"

Constantine replied, "It's inevitable that the pride of my family, the Sky of Chang, was stolen by the Clothes Demon. I've accepted it as fate. As for this big day, I truly appreciate everyone's understanding!"

Although there was no evidence, his words implied that Xia Ge had already been regarded as a thief who had stolen the clothes.

"That Clothes Demon is truly despicable!!"

"She deserves to die!"

"Constantine is right to be angry!"

"Hahaha, Constantine, just say what you want to say! We're all here listening!"

Some people watched coldly from the sidelines, while others wanted to say "there's no evidence yet," but they were undoubtedly in the minority, drowned out by the waves of righteous indignation.
Even when some people spoke up, they were scolded by others: "How dare you talk to that little demon girl? Are you bewitched?" 

So some people stopped talking altogether. 

Sometimes, rumors and conformity are more terrifying than a sharp blade. 

Chang Ren was filled with righteous indignation: "This little demon girl not only released the evil spirits from Evil Spirit Mountain, but also committed this despicable act of theft. I really can't swallow this anger - whoever can catch that little demon girl who stole the clothes, my Chang family will give them one hundred thousand high-grade spirit stones!" 

As soon as he said this, the four sides erupted in noise. 

"Brother Chang is so generous!" 

"That's right, let's drink to that!" 

"Hahaha, Brother Chang, did you use the money for your son's wedding to offer the reward...?" 

Chang Ren returned to his seat and calmly picked up the tea cup that had been placed aside, using the lid to dispel the curling tea smoke. 

Just as the atmosphere was filled with joy, suddenly a loud noise erupted! 

The tea in Chang Ren's cup trembled slightly. Chang's wife's face changed slightly, "What happened?" 

Chang Ren narrowed his eyes. 

He had expected that there might be trouble... and sure enough, it had arrived. 

Suddenly, a huge pressure burst forth from the ground! Firecracker debris flew in the wind, and the sky and earth changed color. The powerful force of the ancient clothes demon was revealed! 

"What's happening?!" 

"Ah...who is that at the door..." 

"Wait, this aura!" 

Chang Ren slowly raised his eyes, and in a burst of mist, a slender figure of a young man appeared, dressed in a pale blue robe embroidered with fine golden patterns. In his hand was a sharp and cold golden long sword, the tip of which was pointed at Chang Ren's head! 

Chang Ren's face changed as soon as he saw the clothes! 

Someone dropped their cup and shouted, "Who are you?!"
The voice of the young man was cold, "Gu Cheng Ye Family, Ye Ze!"

The man sneered, "A nameless pawn!"

However, there were whispers below that couldn't help but speak, "...Gu Cheng Ye Family, is it that Ye Family?"

"Wait, what is he wearing?!"

Chang Ren lightly sipped his tea, he was not flustered. The servant had just reported that someone had broken in wearing strange clothes - but he didn't expect it to be this kid.

And, he was even wearing the Azure Sky Brilliance!!

He calmly said, "This is not a place for children to play around--"

"Boom!"

The sharp blade marks shattered the tea table. Even though Chang's wife was used to seeing storms, she was still frightened by such a sharp aura. Her well-maintained, blood-red manicured fingers stiffly held the tea cover, and the tea cup tilted, spilling the scalding tea on her body, but she didn't dare to move.

"Bold!"

The people around were crowded, cursing, but no one dared to really step forward.

The pressure on his clothes was terrifying.

Ye Ze pointed at Chang Ren's head, word by word, "I want you to take back every word you just said."

Chang Ren calmly placed the tea cup on the other side. A servant immediately understood his signal and took the tea cup. He sneered, "What if I don't take it back?"

"Then I'll leave your head behind!" Ye Ze said, "Such a despicable person is really rare!"

Chang Ren sneered, "I see that you are really presumptuous! The Azure Sky Brilliance on your body, could it be that the little demon girl stole it and gave it to you to wear?!"

Azure Sky Brilliance!

This statement shocked everyone!

Because the Azure Sky Brilliance had always been hidden by the Chang Family, even though it had appeared thanks to the White Dream Cave, it was rarely seen by anyone. Therefore, few people had really seen what the Azure Sky Brilliance looked like. When Chang Ren mentioned it, everyone's eyes were immediately drawn to the young man's clothes!
