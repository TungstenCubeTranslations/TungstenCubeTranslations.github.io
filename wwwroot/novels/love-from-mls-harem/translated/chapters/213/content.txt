The Demon Cult, the Priest's Hall.

The sunlight spilled all over the empty hall, giving it an inexplicable sense of emptiness and loneliness.

Bai Zhi half-knelt on the ground and reported, "The people we sent out didn't find any trace of the little priest, nor did they hear of any slaughter. However, there have been a few more waves of evil spirits."

Su Chan looked at the bite marks on her wrist with a faint gaze, seemingly indifferent to the news.

But Bai Zhi knew that she wasn't really indifferent. After all, when the little priest disappeared, the dark guards sent out by the cult leader were like madmen, digging three feet into the ground of every sect and faction, but they still found nothing.

Bai Zhi paused and said, "Also...the senior disciple of Dan Feng from Lingxi has disappeared."

"I know," Su Chan said, looking out the window.

Not far away on the mountaintop, even in broad daylight, there was a sudden burst of light.

Strengthening the power of the Pure Spirit Pearl was just a drop in the bucket.

She watched quietly for a while and asked, "Did Chu Jiazhu take any action after receiving the letter?"

Bai Zhi hesitated for a moment and said, "...Chu Jia didn't do much. Chu Jia's eldest daughter is still planning to get married. But the Hundred Ghosts' Cave helped that young man from the Ye family sneak into Chang's house and steal the Sky-Piercing Brilliance. After that, he seemed to have figured something out and advanced to the Earth Realm."

Su Chan didn't seem to care much about Ye Ze's affairs. She said casually, "Did Chang's family do anything?"

"Chang's family didn't dare to make a fuss, but they seemed to have another plan in secret..." Bai Zhi said.

"Naturally, they have another plan. Chu Yi doesn't care about Chu Jia's life or death. Chu Dao has already recognized Chu Yao as his master. When Chu Yao gets married, it's equivalent to giving Chang's family an ancient demon." Su Chan chuckled.

"Before the Sky-Piercing Brilliance was stolen, Chang's family had issued a call to arms with the excuse of the Sky-Piercing Brilliance, summoning righteous people to besiege the little priest," Bai Zhi said hesitantly.

The incident of Xia Ge's defection from Lingxi Peak had caused quite a stir recently. After Chang's family got their hands on the Sky-Piercing Brilliance, they were eager to establish their position as a righteous leader. They simply took advantage of this opportunity and used the Sky-Piercing Brilliance as an excuse to call on all the righteous people to join forces to attack the demoness Qin Shuang.

Su Chan had heard of this incident before, but because Xia Ge was under the protection of the Thousand Souls Sect, she didn't care about their methods.

With her Thousand Souls Sect blocking the way, Chang Ren wasn't afraid of getting caught up in the wind.

But now that Xia Ge had disappeared, this matter was naturally different.

Su Chan narrowed her eyes dangerously. "Oh? The Sky-Piercing Brilliance was stolen, but the call to arms hasn't been lifted yet?"
In other words, the Chang family plans to put on a show of wealth despite their financial difficulties?

"At the moment, no..." Bai Zhixiao consoled cautiously, "Little priestess is so clever, she shouldn't be found so easily."

Their dark guards of the demonic cult were among the best in the various factions, and they couldn't find anyone even after digging three feet underground. It seemed that the righteous people wouldn't be so easily...

Su Chan sneered, with a shallow smile on her lips and cold eyes, "If you can't find her, it's because you're incompetent. I don't want to hear this kind of talk again."

Bai Zhixiao fell silent.

Su Chan pondered for a moment, "The theft of the Radiance of the Sky and the wedding of the eldest daughter of the Li family are still a few days away. It's such an awkward situation, yet the Martial Arts Tournament has not been cancelled..."

Are they really putting on a show of wealth or do they have something to rely on?

Su Chan's gaze turned cold, "Keep watch over the Chang family these days and report any news to me immediately."

"Yes!"

Bai Zhixiao had just walked a few steps when she turned back and asked, "Leader, little priestess..."

Su Chan didn't even lift her head, "Keep looking."

Bai Zhixiao left, and Su Chan was lost in thought for a while. Then she raised her wrist and a clear and distinct bite mark appeared on the white and tender skin.

Su Chan could even recall the bright and arrogant blood pupils of the person at that time.

Gu Peijiu disappeared?

Ha.

Su Chan smiled with narrowed eyes. As she kept smiling, she inexplicably thought of the distant past, the vast sky, the undulating mountains, and the carefree girl by her side.

Slowly, she found it hard to keep smiling.

The stunning red-clothed girl restrained her smile and took out a bone flute from her bosom. Her delicate hand caressed the bone, and her long eyelashes cast a transparent shadow on her eyes.

At this moment, a green-clothed maid knocked on the door cautiously, "Leader."

Su Chan's voice was lazy, and she couldn't tell if she was happy or angry, "Come in."

The green-clothed maid walked closer and bowed, "Madam Ye is here to visit."
"Madam Ye?"

Su Chan paused her movements of playing the bone flute of the Mosuo people. After a moment, she casually said, "Let her in."

Soon, the maid in green brought Madam Ye in.

The windows of the priest's hall were wide open, and the sunlight poured in like it was free. Madam Ye was supported by Mao Qing as she entered.

Su Chan did not turn around, only looked out of the window and said, "â€¦ Whether it's a person or a ghost, when there is something to worry about, it's always different from usual."

She seemed to be talking to herself, or just casually mentioning it.

Madam Ye said, "The leader is joking."

Su Chan put away the flute, stood up, her gorgeous red dress was like a blooming fire-red lotus, making her look even more charming. She turned her head and smiled, "I really want to know what kind of love potion Madam Ye gave to my little priest. Although she is not very attached to this barren land in the north, disappearing overnight is still particularly heartbreaking."

Madam Ye said, "Even if the leader wants to hide the fact that Chu's eldest daughter is getting married, the little priest may not understand your good intentions."

Good intentions?

Madam Ye's words seemed to be quite complimentary.

"Well, then it's really troublesome for Madam Ye to come forward." Su Chan smiled coldly, "Madam Ye came to see me, I'm sure it's not to apologize."

Madam Ye was the first puppet that Su Chan successfully controlled and did not let her soul fly away and turn into an evil spirit, so Su Chan would not do anything to her.

Madam Ye said, "I want to see my son."

Su Chan narrowed her eyes.

Chang Family.

After the theft of the Radiance of the Sky.

"Waste, waste!!" The head of the Chang family covered his chest, furious, "You are all a bunch of waste!!"

Chang Lan and his servants remained silent.

"..."
After the head of the Chang family vented his anger, he took a deep breath and said, "All of you, leave! Useless fools!"

The people looked at each other, wanting to say something but having nothing to say. In the end, they could only leave one by one. Before leaving, Chang Lan hesitated and stopped. "Father, about the Martial Arts Tournament, should we..."

"No." The head of the Chang family glared at him. "Get out of here!"

Chang Lan left.

The head of the Chang family, Chang Ren, leaned on his forehead for a while. He had achieved great success in his internal cultivation, ranking as a high-level Earth-ranked warrior. He was only one step away from breaking through to the Sky rank.

Throughout the Fengyue Continent, he was also considered a super master.

But now, this super master was obviously troubled by the Martial Arts Tournament... or the theft of the Azure Brilliance.

The Martial Arts Tournament was not a child's game of rock-paper-scissors. If you lost, you couldn't cheat and play again. As the saying goes, a ruler must be serious. If you want to become the leader of the righteous path, you obviously can't be so indecisive.

Even if he admitted defeat and withdrew from the Martial Arts Tournament, there would inevitably be various suspicions, and rumors that were not favorable to the Ye family's reputation would be more likely to leak... even if there weren't any, there would still be other rumors that were not favorable to the Ye family.

The lights were on.

"Don't worry." A deep voice sounded, "I will help you."

Chang Ren closed his eyes and didn't open them. His voice was calm and not panicked. "I think our transaction ended several years ago."

"But now you need me." The voice of Huo Ming was gloomy. "I know where Qin Shuang is. You need to catch her to establish your reputation... I can help you."

After a pause, it seemed to find it interesting. "The Martial Arts Tournament called by a father for his own daughter... interesting, interesting."

The lights flickered and Chang Ren's face showed no expression. "Isn't she the person you've always wanted?"

Huo Ming thought of Gu Peijiu and his voice was grim. "There is an obstacle."

"What do you want me to do?" Chang Ren asked.

"I want you to spread rumors... that Danfeng's Gu Peijiu was kidnapped by the demonic priestess Qin Shuang, who was bewitched and colluded with the demonic sect, and betrayed the Lingxi Peak."

Chang Ren was a little surprised. "You said Gu Peijiu and that little demon girl are together?"

Using the term "little demon girl," this person in charge of the Chang family seemed to have forgotten that this was his own daughter.

Or, he had never cared.
"Yes," it said.

It paused. "Perhaps we need to make a new deal..."

Chang Ren stood firm. "What can I get?"

"I can not only tell you where Qin Shuang is, but also replace the Sky's Radiance and allow you to break through to the Heaven level," Huo Ming's voice tempted. "If you can find a hundred people to sacrifice to me..."

"..."

The lights went out.

The moonlight in the sky grew dimmer and dimmer.

A few days later.

There was no news of any "major items" being stolen from the Chang family, but the day of Chu family's eldest daughter's wedding was approaching step by step.

Xia Ge ran back to the mountain courtyard with a big bag of berries. "Senior Sister, I'm back!"

Gu Peiju was flipping through a book, her voice faint. "Why are you in such a hurry?"

Xia Ge ran over to Gu Peiju and dumped the berries on the ground. The round fruit rolled a few times on the ground. She said, "These berries are really delicious. I found them on the mountain. I'll pick out a few good ones for Senior Sister to wash, hehehe..."

Xia Ge picked out a few and was about to go wash them when Gu Peiju suddenly grabbed the back of her collar.

Her slender fingers were cool, and unintentionally brushed against the girl's fair neck.

It was tingling, as if an electric shock had passed through her.

Xia Ge felt like she had been electrocuted and couldn't move.

Damn, it's deadly.

Gu Peiju's voice was slow and steady. "Flattery will get you nowhere."

It had been so long, and the little fox couldn't hold back anymore?

At the words, Xia Ge suddenly regained her ability to move and argued, "I'm not, I'm not! I'm just washing some berries for Senior Sister..."
Gu Peijiu turned her jade hand and turned the person around, squinting her eyes to examine her.

The girl had just come in with a bunch of berries in her soul bag. The once-black soul bag now had spots of dirt that it hadn't had time to clean off...

After examining her for a while, Gu Peijiu suddenly asked, "Are you tired?"

Summer Song, who hadn't noticed anything wrong, quickly expressed her determination, "Not at all tired of taking care of my senior sister!"

While expressing her determination, she thought about how to show the "revolutionary friendship" between herself and her friend Chu Yao in the least suspicious way...

Gu Peijiu remained calm, "I see..."

Her hand on the girl's shoulder slowly moved down. Her beautiful hand shone almost white in the sunlight.

This white, shining hand skillfully slipped into Summer Song's clothing strap. Summer Song, who had expressed her determination thunderously, suddenly realized something was wrong and was about to run away. But Gu Peijiu was not so easily fooled. Her fingers curved, hooking onto Summer Song's clothing strap and holding her in place. Her voice was calm and steady, but there were turbulent undercurrents beneath, "I'm hungry."

Summer Song, who had been tormented all night and had secretly taken medicine to recover and continue climbing the mountain the next day, cried out, "I'm hungry too, Senior Sister!! Let's eat berries!! Let's eat berries!!"

Gu Peijiu calmly closed the book in her hand, "Actually, there's another way to eat them."

"Hahaha, no matter how we eat them, we have to wash them first, hahaha..." Summer Song, who was sweating profusely, glanced at the cover of the book in her senior sister's hand.

"The Forty-Six Techniques of the Spring Palace."

Summer Song: "..."

Senior Sister, you can't do this in broad daylight!

When she used to read hentai in class, she knew to use a math book to cover it up!

In bed.

Summer Song clung to Gu Peijiu's clothes, weeping bitterly, "Senior Sister, I'm hungry, I'm really hungry, ah..."

Gu Peijiu leaned over her, her voice slightly hoarse, "Hmm, be good, let's try a different position... Do you want to eat berries?"

Summer Song: "..."

No!!!
...

The spring scenery was lazy.

Summer lay in Gu Peiju's arms, her head resting on her soft body, numbly thinking about how to wash herself with berries and get herself onto the bed.

This question was too profound, and she couldn't quite figure it out.

So she stopped thinking.

It was so fragrant, she wanted to kiss again.

She looked up at Gu Peiju, her watery eyes shimmering. Gu Peiju lowered her head and kissed her, their lips and tongues entwining.

Her senior sister's mouth was so sweet, with the taste of berries.

She wanted to eat more...

Summer tried harder to stick her tongue into her mouth, as if this would allow her to taste more.

The long lashes under Gu Peiju's eyes cast fine shadows as their lips and tongues intertwined, and Summer began to feel a little dazed.

Oh, right...what was she planning to do again?

The system reminded her discreetly: "...revolutionize your feelings."

Summer suddenly came to her senses with a start. "Uh, uh, uh...Senior Sister!"

Gu Peiju opened her eyes and looked at her.

Summer glanced at her, then turned her eyes away, feeling embarrassed.

Her milk-white skin, her small waist that was just enough to hold onto, her black eyes that were filled with a fine mist, whenever she looked at her, she was always filled with a warm and tender feeling.

"I...I have something to say to you..."

Gu Peiju was calm and composed. "What is it?"

Summer's heart was beating so fast that she thought she might blow hot air into her ear. She might not be able to compare to Daji who confused King Zhou, but...but...
The system poured cold water on her: "Daji didn't tell King Zhou in bed that she was going to save the little white face and make him wear a green hat."

Xia Ge's mind went blank: "Senior sister, I'll wear it for you..."

Gu Peijiu looked at her with a smile that was not a smile: "Hmm?"

Xia Ge said: "Pah! No, not that."

What little white face! She and Chu Yao had a pure revolutionary relationship! A revolutionary relationship!! And there was no green hat!

She got so excited that she made the system take a hike and the green hat too.

Xia Ge reached out and hugged Gu Peijiu's white and tender neck, secretly kissed her, and then pretended to be nonchalant and said: "...I heard that the eldest daughter of the Chu family is getting married."

The system actively cursed for Gu Peijiu: "Eating from the pot and looking at the bowl."

Xia Ge ignored it and continued to talk to Gu Peijiu: "You know, senior sister has always taught me about manners and etiquette. I met Chu Shifu... no, I mean, I met Chu Yao sister and I think I should give her some gift money or something, otherwise it's not very polite..."

Before Gu Peijiu could respond, Xia Ge kissed her on the face and quickly expressed her loyalty: "Anyway, I like senior sister the most, I listen to everything she says!"

Gu Peijiu looked at the fox tail peeking out from behind the little girl's butt in her arms, raised her eyebrows, but didn't say anything.

The little girl she liked was trying every way to snatch someone else's bride. How enjoyable.

"..."

Seeing that Gu Peijiu was indifferent, Xia Ge begged: "Senior sister..."

Gu Peijiu spoke slowly: "Just giving a gift?"

Xia Ge: "..."

Of course, it couldn't just be a gift.

"By the way, if I can steal a kiss or something, it wouldn't be a bad thing..." Xia Ge said hesitantly.

Gu Peijiu laughed: "Little fox."

Xia Ge took advantage of the situation and shamelessly said: "But it's only senior sister's little fox."

Gu Peijiu shook her head: "You might get snatched away if you're not careful."
Xia Ge covered her lips and her black eyes were shining. After the kiss, the girl patted her chest and looked very stylish. "Can't snatch it! It's only yours!"

Gu Peiju looked at the beautiful girl in front of her and was a little dazed for a moment.

When Xia Ge saw that Gu Peiju was stunned by her, she felt proud and thought to herself that although she couldn't compare to Su Daji and Zhao Feiyan, she could still charm her senior sister, who was also a great beauty!

However, before Xia Ge could feel too proud of herself, everything around her spun and she was pressed onto the bed by Gu Peiju. Gu Peiju's voice was hoarse. "Again."

Xia Ge, who was feeling proud just moments ago, was speechless.

"I'm not doing it again! I'm hungry! Senior sister, I'm hungry! I want to eat..."

Actually, Xia Ge wasn't hungry at all. As a puppet master at the Earth level, it was impossible for her to not feel hungry for a month without eating anything. She just didn't want to move.

Gu Peiju didn't care about Xia Ge's little tricks and directly covered her lips. After a long kiss, Gu Peiju's jade-like hand slowly moved downwards. She whispered, "Hmm, don't move. I'll feed you. Be good."

After a pause, Gu Peiju chuckled and said, "Xia Xia is the most obedient."

In this world, being slapped in the face was always the most painful thing.

Xia Ge was speechless.

After working hard for a day and night, Xia Ge felt that she couldn't have worked in vain.

The system despised her, "You sound so unhappy."

Xia Ge pretended not to hear and hugged Gu Peiju, rubbing her head against her chest. "Hey, senior sister, when you're wandering in the world, you're bound to get hurt... no, what I mean is, when one is in trouble, everyone should help each other..."

Gu Peiju touched her soft hair and felt the faint fragrance on her body. She casually said, "You don't have anyone to help you when you're in trouble."

Xia Ge was speechless.

Her summary was quite accurate.

Although Gu Peiju was in a coma, she heard the rumors later and knew that besides Tian Zhuling and Su Chan, who wanted to take Xia Ge away, no one stood on Xia Ge's side.
The girl she loves stands in front of her, facing the condemnation of the crowd, alone and helpless.

Even just thinking about it, Gu Peiju feels heartbroken.

Her life isn't particularly long, and she doesn't have anything she likes or dislikes too much. She lives a rule-abiding life, but also a bit carefree.

Only this person lives in her heart.

Putting aside the entanglements of past lives, just this girl alone, Gu Peiju can't bear to see her suffer even a little bit or be even slightly unhappy.

If it makes her unhappy, then it's better to let it go.

So she quietly left the Lingxi Peak.

This place was personally created by Xia Wushuang, but after the passage of time and the inheritance of generations, it has changed its flavor.

Factions that abandoned right and wrong and only cared about interests had long since violated Xia Wushuang's original intentions.

They also betrayed the reason she was guarding.

Gu Peiju thought, and her eyes gradually darkened.

Xia Ge didn't know what Gu Peiju was thinking. The other's insightful response left her speechless. She could only wrap herself in the blanket and curl up into a ball, "No... Chu Yao sister came to the Demon Cult to find me later, she wanted to take me out..."

Gu Peiju's voice was a bit dangerous, but her tone was still unhurried, "Oh? Are you saying that a few days ago, when Chu Zhan passed away and the eldest daughter of the Chu family disappeared inexplicably, not even attending her own father's funeral, it was because she went to the Demon Cult to save you?"

Xia Ge was startled, her eyes widened, "Huh?"

Gu Peiju leaned in close to the girl, looked at her round eyes, and smoothed her black hair with slender fingers. Her expression was playful, "Chu Yao sister risked her life to help you from miles away, even abandoning her own father. If I were to stop you from repaying her kindness, wouldn't that be a bit inhumane?"

Her tone was somewhat like that of a jealous bookworm.

Xia Ge couldn't care about that much anymore, "Yes, yes, yes, it's inhumane, too inhumane. How could Chu Yao sister not attend her father's funeral! That's really too inhumane! And Sister, Chu Yao sister and I have a pure revolutionary relationship! Heaven and earth can bear witness! The sun and moon can testify!"

Gu Peiju's lips curved into a slight smile, but she didn't say anything, just stared at her.

Xia Ge felt a bit cold sweat from being stared at.

How should she put it, her feelings for Chu Shi-jie were pure revolutionary feelings, but Chu Shi-jie had some impure feelings towards her, but she had firmly refused... It didn't seem wrong to ignore this point for now...
After a pause, Xia Ge quickly reaffirmed her determination: "Senior sister, I only like you, really, really."

Gu Peiju saw that the little girl seemed to be struggling with her conscience, so she spoke slowly: "There are still fifteen days until Chu Yao's wedding day."

Xia Ge looked at her eagerly.

Gu Peiju's eyes softened slightly as she touched her head, "It's not easy for me to see the girl I like thinking about someone else."

Xia Ge said eagerly: "No, senior sister, my heart is all yours now, but there's just too much of it, I can barely contain it."

"But since she saved you, she is also your benefactor." Gu Peiju sighed lightly, lowered her head to touch Xia Ge's forehead, and looked into her dark eyes. "When that day comes, we'll go together."

Xia Ge's eyes lit up: "Senior sister, you agreed!"

Gu Peiju murmured, "It's hard to keep thinking about something all day and not say it."

Xia Ge pouted, looking unhappy.

"But I'm glad." Gu Peiju paused and sighed softly. "You finally..."

Xia Ge covered her lips with her hand. "Finally what? I've always been honest with you! I have always been sincere to senior sister! It's not 'finally', it's 'already', I've been like this for a long time!"

The system: "..."

I've never seen such shamelessness.

Gu Peiju didn't say anything, staring at the scenery on her chest.

Xia Ge suddenly realized that one of her hands was still on Gu Peiju's mouth, and her little blanket fell off with the force of gravity, revealing a hint of her shoulder. She quickly covered herself like a penguin from Antarctica, looking at her with a wary expression, as if guarding against thieves.

Gu Peiju smiled slightly and casually touched her head. "Is there anything else you want to say?"

Her peripheral vision glanced at the small gap in Xia Ge's chest.

Xia Ge screamed: "We can't do this anymore! I'm hungry! I'm really hungry! Don't look! Don't look!!"
