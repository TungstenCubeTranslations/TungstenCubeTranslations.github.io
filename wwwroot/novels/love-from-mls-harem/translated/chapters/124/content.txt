The rain was not heavy, but small and fine. The little girl held the last hawthorn candy skewer and followed Xia Ge as they walked towards the direction of the broken temple in the rain. The weather was gloomy, and the curtain of daylight was about to fall.

"Are you a brother or a sister?" the little girl asked.

"A brother," Xia Ge said.

"Oh, a brother," the little girl repeated, holding her small hands together. She asked, "Where are you going now, brother?"

"To find someone."

"Who are you looking for?"

"Looking for..." Xia Ge's voice suddenly stopped.

In its place, there was a distant and desperate scream!

"Brother..." the little girl's mouth was suddenly covered, and her light grey glassy eyes widened in confusion. Xia Ge quickly activated his stealth ability and took the little girl into the small forest next to the broken temple, hiding behind a cluster of trees.

The little girl felt that something was wrong. The screams and the smell of blood made her shiver, but she didn't feel very scared.

It was just that her brother was trembling.

The sky was dark, and there was no light to be seen.

Broken flesh, manifested evil spirits, and demons that tore apart humans.

It was a cruel feast, a cruel flower blooming in a sea of blood, leading to the other side of the river of death.

The nauseating smell of blood filled the air.

It was the first time Xia Ge had experienced a massacre.

The small partner who used to beg together was now covered in blood. Half of his body was torn apart by the evil spirits shrouded in black mist, and the splattering blood stained the land outside the broken temple red. The heart-wrenching screams made it almost impossible to remember what breathing was.
"Help me--"

"Ah--"

They screamed in agony.

Xia Ge could only curl up in the corner, watching helplessly, unable to do anything.

Powerless.

Seeing others die in front of her like this, feeling helpless, was really too painful.

The little girl felt the hand covering her mouth tremble slightly and opened a small gap.

Because she was too stiff, it was as if she had fallen into a nightmare and didn't even know what she was doing.

"...Brother." Chu Yi whispered, "...what did you see?"

What did she see?

Blood, slaughter, evil spirits with smiling faces, and companions who couldn't close their eyes in death.

...The Evil Ghost Camp.

"Hua." Xia Ge covered the little girl's ears, hugged her tightly, and spoke softly, "Over there, there are many, many flowers."

The smell of blood, the piercing screams, and the evil laughter of the ghosts could faintly be heard.

But her brother's embrace was warm.

The little girl hesitated for a moment, then asked obediently, "Are they very beautiful flowers?"

Xia Ge's voice was hoarse, and her body was cold, "Yes, they are very beautiful flowers."

She hugged the little girl tightly and felt for the first time that everything was really good.

This child couldn't see.

Really, everything was good.

The two of them were silent for a long time.
The group of demons ended their massacre and poured tung oil over the bodies before setting them on fire to destroy all evidence.

In the distance, the flames lit up the dark sky, casting a red hue that even the rain couldn't wash away.

It was bitter.

Her tongue tasted bitter.

The old man's words from that day still echoed in her ears.

-"You did all you could. No one will blame you."

Now, a sea of flames consumed everything.

But it was so bitter.

It was almost enough to make her cry.

Warm drops of water fell on her face. The little girl looked up, unable to see or hear.

But she knew that the rain that had fallen on her along the way was cold.

And the water on her face was hot.

She quietly tasted it.

It was a little bitter.

"...Did brother cry?" The little girl's voice was small.

"No." Xia Ge whispered, "I don't cry. I just think these flowers are really beautiful."

It was so bitter.

The two children huddled together behind a tree, drawing warmth from each other in the cold rain. Chu Yi thought for a moment, carefully plucked the last hawthorn from her candy skewer, and then reached out to touch Xia Ge's face, running her hand over his eyebrows, eyes, nose, and finally to his mouth.

Her hand was wet with warm water.

Chu Yi tasted it, salty and a little bitter.

Brother was lying.
Chuyi thought to herself that she only cries when she feels bitter, so her brother must be feeling bitter.

Xia Ge just stared blankly at the fire not far away, letting the child's cold little hand touch her face without moving.

How could there be such cruel things in this world?

Why do we hurt each other?

The little hand withdrew, and then a sugar-coated hawthorn was carefully and firmly stuffed into Xia Ge's mouth.

The little girl hugged Xia Ge's neck with her tender arms and said softly, "I'll give you all my sugar-coated hawthorns, brother, don't cry."

The sweet sugar coating melted on her tongue, and Xia Ge unconsciously took a bite. The sour and bitter taste of hawthorn spread in her mouth.

What a little liar.

It's so sour, not sweet at all.

- Do you believe in karma in this world?

Xia Ge wondered.

She didn't believe it before, but now, she kind of does.

Because she met this child.

So she can continue to walk on this dangerous path.

"...Thank you." Xia Ge leaned her head on the girl's shoulder, gazing at the distant fire, choked up, "Thank you."

Thank goodness you're here.

The flames were raging, the smell of blood filled the air, and the two held each other tightly, as if they could merge into each other's lives and never be separated in this life.

Chuyi thought.

That's great.

This person is mine now.

- I'm alone.
The troublemaking demons had finished causing a commotion and were on their way back home when they heard a faint sound coming from the forest.

It sounded like someone was crying?

"Who's over there?!"

= =

Baimeng Cave.

"...Brother?"

The girl's voice was soft and gentle. "What are you thinking about?"

Xia Ge snapped out of his thoughts.

The memory of flames and the terrifying faces of demons were swallowed by the mist of Baimeng Cave. All the pain and sadness seemed to fade away with the passage of time, leaving no trace.

The mist of Baimeng Cave still lingered, and the illusion of the Rain God Temple had disappeared. She shook her head. "It's nothing."

Chuyi said, "Clearly, Brother is so close to me."

Close enough to touch, and his breath was audible.

Her arms slowly tightened. "...Why do I still feel so far away?"

The distance between their bodies was less than an inch, but the distance between their hearts was as vast as the horizon.

The mist of Baimeng Cave's illusion disappeared, and Xia Ge carried her on his back. "Maybe we walked too short a distance."

Short, bitter, and painful.

Chuyi thought.

It would be so great if you were mine alone.

Xia Ge carried Chuyi and walked back. After a while, they came across a fork in the road.

Two paths.

There wasn't a road here when they came over just now.
On the left is where they just came from. If they keep walking, they will encounter the green dragon. The right path is new, perhaps a new trick of the White Dream Cave.

She thought about it and took the right path.

Chuyi: "Aren't we going back?"

Although there is a green dragon there, the cave extends in eight directions.

"I'm not going back," Xia Ge said. "I don't want to see the dragon again."

Chuyi narrowed his eyes.

They didn't walk for long before they reached the end. It was a pitch-black cave with two glowing doors, one black and one white, with intricate magical patterns on the edges, giving it an ancient and majestic look.

The white door had a keyhole, but the black one did not, as if it could be pushed open easily.

A green light flashed in Xia Ge's eyes.

[Retrospective Door: A door that can take you back to the past, with the key to the Gate of Life inside.]

[Gate of Life: The exit of the White Dream Cave, with the key to open it in the Retrospective Door.]

The black door on the left is the Retrospective Door, and the white door is the Gate of Life.

She tried pushing the Gate of Life, but it didn't budge.

It needed a key.

The system said, "No wonder they say the White Dream Cave can take you back to the past. The Retrospective Door is here."

"What does that mean?" Xia Ge asked.

"Entering the Retrospective Door allows you to go back in time and see some past events."

Some past events...

"How can we get the key?" Xia Ge asked.

"I don't know," the system replied.

"..."
Chuyi asked, "What kind of door is this?"

"It's the Retrospective Door and the Birth Door," Xia Ge replied.

Xia Ge reached out to open the Retrospective Door. "I heard that if you go in, you can see past events."

"The key to the Birth Door is inside," Xia Ge added.

Chuyi hesitated for a moment, then hugged Xia Ge tightly and asked softly, "If we go out, will the dream end?"

Xia Ge's hand on the doorknob paused.

Chuyi said, "Don't go."

After a moment, she continued, "No, it's the beginning of another dream."

The black door was pushed open, and a brilliant light flickered. Xia Ge disappeared on Chuyi's back, and she appeared alone in a gloomy and dark city.

Xia Ge looked up at the dark sky and the withered trees on both sides of the official road paved with bluestones, thinking that she had really gone back to the past.

Otherwise, she would not have come to Ghost City again.

That day, the evil spirits set fire to the temple, and she and Chuyi were discovered and fled all the way, exhausted.

Nightmares every night.

She and Chuyi took a break in a small village.

"I mean... this will have a butterfly effect, right? The people who shouldn't have been caught were caught, and the people I shouldn't have met were met."

Ye Ze shouldn't have been caught, and Chuyi should have met Ye Ze, not her.

The system replied, "Existence is reasonable. If the plot is changed due to accidents, just change it back."

The little girl in her arms heard her muttering to herself and grabbed her clothes, asking, "What is the butterfly effect?"

Thirst for knowledge.

Xia Ge made up a story, "The butterfly effect is a very beautiful butterfly."

"What does a very beautiful butterfly look like?" Chuyi thought for a moment. "Am I beautiful like that?"
Xia Ge found pleasure in her suffering: "You are like a butterfly, a thousand times more beautiful than it, my little butterfly."

Death and pain tormented her.

During those days, she dreamed of Dou Dou, the old beggar, Ye Ze, their partner in begging, and even her parents whose faces were blurred in modern times, as well as her younger brother who had depended on her for many years.

The real Xia Wu Yin.

"...Is Xia Wu Yin the person my brother is looking for?" 

Xia Ge: "..."

Little girl: "My brother has been shouting this name in his dreams."

Xia Ge: "..."

"Does your brother have a name?"

"...No."

"Why isn't your brother talking?"

"...It's okay, little butterfly will always be by your brother's side."

"...Okay."

During those dark and hopeless days, they didn't collapse because they had Chu Yi.

Fortunately, they supported each other through it all.

The days were very bitter, but they had many wishes.

They hoped that the child's beautiful eyes could see the light again, that they could find clues about Ye Ze, and that they could become stronger, even if they became a puppeteer that everyone hated.

At that time, even eating a steamed bun was done cautiously.

She joked with Chu Yi, "Look at this steamed bun. After eating this, you'll never know where the next one is."

Chu Yi only opened his beautiful light gray eyes, smiled lightly, hugged her neck, kissed her cheek, and told her that it was okay, that little butterfly would drive away all the ghosts and goblins.

-Don't be afraid.
The evil spirits were relentless in their pursuit, and the soul-capturing technique was useless against them. The system told her to go find the Ghost Dragon Jade.

Ye Ze's Ghost Dragon Jade.

"Where are you going, big brother?" Chu Yi tugged at her clothes, looking a bit lost.

"I'm going to find something that scares the evil spirits," Xia Ge said. 

The little girl's voice was anxious. "Are you leaving me behind, big brother?"

"No, I'm not," Xia Ge said. "Just wait for me to come back."

The little girl held onto her clothes tightly. "Why don't you take me with you? Little butterflies aren't afraid of anything."

Xia Ge was silent for a long time. "But I'm afraid."

"...If I lose you, I won't have anything left."

His voice was hoarse.

It sounded sweet, though, like a piece of candy that would never melt, spreading sweetness in her heart.

The little girl thought about it.

Xia Ge hugged her and said softly, "Will you wait for me?"

"...," The little girl clutched her clothes. "You swear you'll come back."

"I swear I'll come back," Xia Ge said.

The little girl looked at her with her light gray eyes, then slowly let go of her hand.

But Xia Ge had only taken a few steps when she heard a low sob. She hesitated and turned back, only to see the little girl's light gray eyes filled with tears.

Feeling her footsteps stop, the little girl couldn't hold back any longer. She jumped out of bed barefoot and, like a real child, hugged Xia Ge and cried out loud, "Big brother's voice is so nice, but what does he look like? What's his name?"

"...Why can't I see anything?" 

"Why won't big brother tell me his name?"
"Do you not like little butterflies, brother?" 

"Brother, are you going to leave me? Swearing is all a lie, I don't believe it, I don't believe it..." 

"Wuwuwu..." 

In her memories, the little butterfly was always smiling, with a gentle smile, a sweet smile. 

Even after killing someone, she only had a blank expression, then a slight smile. 

She had always been obedient, too obedient for a child. She only held her hand and followed wherever she went, never crying or making a fuss. 

"Is it because my eyes are ugly?" But now she was panicking, "It must be because my eyes are too ugly. Mother said my eyes are the ugliest... Did I scare you? I'll cover them up... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, brother, please don't go..." 

She held onto him tightly, as if holding onto everything that kept her alive. 

It was heart-wrenching. 

Xia Ge lowered her head and kissed her tear-stained eyes, which were a light grey color. 

"Your mother lied to you. You have beautiful eyes, little butterfly," she said, "These are the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen, really." 

The girl still held onto her tightly. "But I can't see them..." 

"If you keep waiting, you'll be able to see them," Xia Ge wiped away her tears, hugged her back, and whispered softly, "I'll make sure you can see them." 

"I swear." 

"I'm not lying to you." 

A long, long time passed. 

The girl slowly let go of Xia Ge's hand. 

"I'll wait for you to come back," she repeated, "You have to come back." 

... 

The memory abruptly ended.
Xia Ge regained her senses and looked at the scenery of the Ghost City in front of her.

That time, she settled Chu Yi and then came to the Ghost City during the day to climb the Magic Spirit Mountain with the eight-headed snake to get the Ghost Dragon Jade.

With the Ghost Dragon Jade, the ghosts of the Evil Ghost Camp would not follow her everywhere. With the Ghost Dragon Jade, she could break through the Evil Ghost Camp.

She climbed the mountain with difficulty, encountering poisonous snakes and insects along the way, and fought with the eight-headed snake that guarded the Ghost Dragon Jade with wit and courage.

But even in the daytime, the weakened eight-headed snake was not her opponent. However, she remembered that Ye Ze took a detour and stole the jade, and the eight-headed snake did not wake up all the way.

She was not the protagonist and naturally did not have such good treatment. Although she took a detour and used light work, the eight-headed snake was still awakened.

Although she stole the Ghost Dragon Jade with the Ghost Shadow Mist, she was bitten by the awakened eight-headed snake before she could be too happy. She had two wounds, and she thought she would definitely die at that time, but she didn't.

She woke up, holding the Ghost Dragon Jade in her hand, and the ferocious eight-headed snake disappeared without a trace, and the wound also disappeared, like a dream.

Xia Ge looked up and climbed up the road of the Magic Spirit Mountain she had walked before.

The system said that the Door of Retrospection would return to the past.

It's not an illusion, it's a real past.

"You will see yourself, but your past self will not see you."

"Others will not see you either."

"Changing the past is prohibited."

"..."

Listening to the system's introduction to the Door of Retrospection, Xia Ge climbed the mountain and also saw her past self who was bitten by the eight-headed snake, holding the Ghost Dragon Jade tightly and gradually falling into a coma.

Xia Ge found for the first time that her past self was so small and weak.

She held the jade stone tightly in her hand, closed her eyes, and the dark red blood flowed all over the ground.

The eight-headed snake had golden scales and shone brightly in the dark sky. The sky in the Ghost City was always so black. Its eight snake heads were ferocious and terrifying. One of the snake heads opened its bloody mouth and was about to swallow her whole.

"..." 

The eight-headed snake was still attacking her?
When she woke up, she thought the eight-headed snake was just an illusion, because there was no snake or injury when she woke up.

Xia Ge was momentarily stiff.

"What's going on? Am I going to die? Die here? Die in the past?"

Just as she was panicking and doubting, "swish," a cold sword light broke through the eternal darkness of the ghost realm.

"Hiss," the snake head that wanted to swallow her was cut off by the sword light! The cold blood suddenly spurted out, and the remaining seven snake heads roared wildly, connected in pain by their hearts. 

A strong pressure spread out, and the eight-headed snake trembled in fear. One of its heads picked up the severed head on the ground, and slowly retreated.

Xia Ge slowly saw the person blocked by the huge body of the eight-headed snake.

Her pupils suddenly shrank!

The pitch-black cloak and black hat covered the face, but she could feel the tall and slender figure holding a cold long sword with slender and delicate hands. The sword was stained with the cold blood of the eight-headed snake, and the blood filled the ancient patterns on the sword. The terrifying pressure spread out, and the eight-headed snake crouched on the ground, trembling.

It was the person in the Rain God Temple in the illusion.

The same outfit, the same hands.

"Who are you?!"

The past cannot see the future.

The person couldn't see Xia Ge. She raised her head slightly, and the eight-headed snake fled in embarrassment. Snakes were cold-blooded and vengeful, but they didn't even have a thought of revenge for the person who had cut off one of their heads.

She took out the scabbard and slowly sheathed the sword.

The scabbard was made of bamboo and carved with two crooked characters - "Ask Love."

She put away the sword and squatted down to feed the child on the ground a pill.
The movements were extremely gentle.

The child was in great pain and struggling, "It hurts...it hurts..."

"It won't hurt anymore." The cloaked figure touched her forehead, their voice clear and soft, "You've taken the medicine, Shuang Shuang won't feel any more pain."

It was like a bolt from the blue!

Xia Ge froze on the spot.

- Who are you?! Who are you calling her...?

After a while, the medicine took effect and the child calmed down. The wound that had been bitten slowly healed before their eyes. The cloaked figure did not leave, instead holding their sword and sitting by the side.

Xia Ge walked up to the figure, her hands trembling, wanting to remove their hood.

However, before she could do so, the cloaked figure seemed to sense something and turned slightly towards Xia Ge's direction.

Xia Ge immediately froze in place, not daring to move.

- Who are you?

It was as if they had heard her inner doubts.

A gentle breeze blew by, and the cloaked figure removed their hood.

In the pitch-black night, that face was so familiar that it made Xia Ge's heart tremble.

The features were like a painting, with beautiful eyebrows and eyes. Their lips were slightly cold and charming, and their black hair was tied up with a wooden hairpin, with a few strands of hair swaying in the wind.

They gently stroked the child's closed eyes, their voice carrying a few sighs.

"...I missed you."

Xia Ge was frozen in place.

"Senior sister...?!"

But...Shuang Shuang?!

The eyebrows and eyes were exactly the same.
The person who looked very much like Gu Peiju lifted their head and gazed at the pitch-black night sky of the ghost city. They slowly retrieved their hand and picked up their bamboo hat. "Time's up. I have to go again."

She was just about to stand up when the child suddenly grabbed her sleeve with their frail, skinny hand and refused to let go. "Don't go, Dou Dou," she murmured, her voice trembling with tears. "Don't leave me..."

Gu Peiju stood there in silence for a long time. After a while, she squatted down and spoke softly, "We will see each other again. But not now."

She slowly pulled the child's hand, which was still clinging to her sleeve, down and finally set up a protective barrier before turning to leave.

Xia Ge followed her like she was under a spell. Was this person her senior sister?

The cloaked figure carried her sword and descended from the Demon Spirit Mountain, with Xia Ge following her every step of the way. They passed through desolate graveyards, shattered streets of the ghost city, and quiet nights. When they were about to leave the ghost city, the cloaked figure stopped in a deserted area and took off her cloak, storing it in her mustard seed space.

Underneath the cloak, the familiar person wore a blood-stained white robe that was almost blindingly white. Xia Ge felt like she couldn't breathe.

That white robe...

Gu Peiju held Wen Qing and spoke coldly, "How many more years do I have to endure with you? You are a curse."

After a moment, Gu Peiju's pupils suddenly shrank, and she drew Wen Qing from its sheath, slashing it fiercely. "Boom!"

The violent sword energy pierced through the sky, and in the blink of an eye, it tore through the void and the dark, otherworldly space disappeared. The ground cracked open with a deafening roar, and the earth shook.

"You really are... stubborn until death," Gu Peiju sneered. "But it doesn't matter. I can continue to endure with you."

The blood-stained white robe trembled, and an overwhelming pressure emanated from it, causing Gu Peiju's face to change. One of her eyes suddenly turned red, and she gritted her teeth. "Do you think... she can still trust you?!"
The tone of this is ominous! Is she being controlled by a curse?

Xia Ge instinctively took a step back.

"Whether you believe it or not doesn't matter," the other person said.

How could it not matter?

"Hahaha, do you think being reborn with a split soul is enough? With one soul in two places, let's see how long you can last! Anyway, she can't remember you, and you can't fight against the will of heaven!"

"Whether she remembers me or not doesn't matter."

How could it not matter?

Just thinking about it made her heart ache.

"It's just that heaven is merciless," Gu Peijiu said, opening her eyes. Her pupils were black and white, and her voice was cold. "I will fight it to the end!"

Xia Ge stood behind her, her face pale.

She slowly lowered her head, a snow-white key in her hand.

= =

Same year, same month.

"The child from the Gu family is really pitiful..."

Dressed in a white mourning garment, the eleven-year-old girl had jet-black eyes and snow-white skin. Her lips were bright red. She knelt in front of her parents' memorial tablet, her expression indifferent.

"What a good child... why did this happen to her..."

"This child is pretty, but it feels like she lacks some vitality..."

"..."

The girl guarding the memorial tablet looked up, her pitch-black eyes cold and emotionless. She was like a beautiful puppet, without any vitality. The people who looked at her instinctively took a step back and then fell silent.

She quietly paid her respects to her parents' memorial tablet, attended the funeral, and buried them in silence.
No tears.

Not a single tear was shed.

As if born emotionless, without joy or sadness.

"Miss."

The old butler of the Gu family approached, cautiously saying, "You should cry a little."

Gu Peiju shook her head. "I can't cry."

It wasn't that she wasn't sad or upset, she just couldn't cry.

The old butler let out a long sigh.

"Do you have any plans?"

Although the Gu family was not as powerful as the Chang'an Chu family, not as wealthy as the Chang family, and not as influential as the Ye family, as a family active in the underworld, their businesses in the black market and the Dream Pavilion were thriving under the watchful eye of the family head.

But maybe they had done too many wicked things, and had contracted an illness, so they died early. Although the lady of the house was not in good health, the family head loved her dearly. When the family head passed away, the lady could not bear it and followed him.

Now, only this child remained.

Although she was a child of the Gu family, she was nothing like her father, who was not serious at all. She was practically the opposite, and strange things happened around her frequently.

When she was born, she didn't cry. Even when she was spanked, she didn't cry. This scared the lady of the house, who thought she had given birth to a mute child.

Fortunately, time proved otherwise.

When it was time to name her, the couple spent a long time searching for a name. They even had trouble sleeping over it. But one night, they had a dream where they heard a line of poetry:

"His son remains, gifting me the name Peiju."

It was amazing that two people could dream the same thing. They felt it was fate, and named her Peiju.

During her one hundred day celebration, a female Taoist in a cloak and hat carrying a bamboo sword came to the house, saying she wanted to bring good luck. However, the less-than-a-hundred-day-old baby paid no attention to the pile of gold ingots and swords, but instead grabbed the red silk ribbon on the woman's wrist.

Although the family was accustomed to running a brothel, they were still slightly embarrassed at this occasion. The Gu family head pretended to be serious and said, "Perhaps my daughter likes red..."

Madam Gu's expression was not good. How could you, a noble daughter, like red?
The female Taoist didn't say much, she took off the red silk ribbon from her wrist and gave it to the young miss, saying it was a gift that had been touched by good fortune. The Taoist then left.

The second ancient demon garment was born on the second day.

It was called "Heaven's Punishment".

The head of the family was afraid of attracting attention, so he kept this matter a secret. Until his death, the only ones who knew about it were the old steward and the young master's parents.

"I have no plans," Gu Peijiu looked at the azure sky. The red Heaven's Punishment silk had rolled around in the flour, turning itself white, and then quietly slipped out of the door crack, trying to sneak past its mourning master.

Gu Peijiu took a step back, her gaze calm. "Go away, stay away from me."

Heaven's Punishment silk rolled on the ground in distress.

"...Miss, don't you want to take over the family business?" The old steward sighed.

Gu Peijiu pulled on one corner of Heaven's Punishment silk and dragged it to the lake, throwing it in without expression. "I want to go on a journey."

The old steward said, "..."

She turned her head and said seriously, "Is there a medicine that can make me forget everything and go on a journey?"

The old steward was slightly taken aback.

"When my mother was alive, she said that we should be happy in life, but every time I think of what they said, I feel uncomfortable," Gu Peijiu looked at Heaven's Punishment silk swimming in the lake, appearing very happy. "But I don't know how to cry."
