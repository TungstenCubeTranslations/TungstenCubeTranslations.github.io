When Xia Ge was about to climb Dan Peak after coming down from Jian Peak, he met his senior brother Lu Qie who was about to climb Dan Peak.

Lu Qie was holding a bunch of scrolls and was very happy to see him, "Hey, Xia junior fellow apprentice!"

After speaking, he changed his words with a smile, "No, it should be Xia junior chief!"

Xia Ge: "......"

Although he didn't want to admit it, why does being called chief feel so good?

Xia Ge put on a fake smile, "Oh, isn't this senior brother Lu Qie? What are you doing?"

They walked together and Lu Qie said, "These are the scrolls I brought down from Jian Peak. I'm going to give them to Senior Sister. These days, Dan Peak has been busy with your promotion ceremony as a profound-level alchemist. Congratulations."

...Scrolls to be given to Senior Sister?

Xia Ge's eyes lit up and then he coughed, "This scroll looks very thick. Let's split it, senior brother!"

Lu Qie was stunned, "Oh, how could that be..."

Although Xia Ge said they would split it, he took all the scrolls and put them in his arms, "Oh, it's too polite of me. Senior brothers and sisters should love each other! Come on, I'll help you carry it and we'll deliver it to Senior Sister!"

The thick scroll almost blocked Xia Ge's head.

Lu Qie: "......Let me take some...this is too high..."

Xia Ge: "No need, no need!"

His body, which had been washed by dragon blood, was full of energy. Carrying a fifty-centimeter-thick scroll was nothing.

Lu Qie: "......"

Although he felt it was not quite right, because he was very afraid of Senior Sister due to making countless mistakes and being punished to copy alchemy books, Lu Qie readily agreed to this proposal.

As a result, he laid a solid foundation for copying thirty alchemy books the next day.

The two of them walked up the mountain together.

"I heard you went to the legendary White Dream Cave?" Lu Qie found a topic to chat about.

"Yes."
"Have you found any treasures?" Lu Qie asked curiously.

Xia Ge smiled: "Where would I get such good luck? I didn't find any treasures, but I almost got burned to ashes by a dragon."

Lu Qie sympathetically looked at her: "You're really unlucky. I thought everyone who went to the White Dream Cave would have some gains."

"Oh?" Xia Ge asked. Did news of Ye Ze obtaining a sword from the White Dream Cave spread?

Lu Qie envied and said: "Haven't you heard? The young master of the Chang family got an ancient garment demon from the White Dream Cave!"

Xia Ge was stunned: "Ah?"

The young master of the Chang family? Who? Wait, the Chang family?

Xia Ge's expression became somewhat complicated.

"... Ancient garment demon?" Xia Ge asked.

Lu Qie nodded, "Yes, it's been spreading. I heard the old man of the Chang family is very happy."

Xia Ge had a vague feeling that something was not right, but she put on a curious expression and asked, "Is that so... Have you heard the name of the ancient garment demon?"

Lu Qie shook his head and rubbed his fingers skillfully, "Hey, Xia Junior Master, if you ask someone else, they may not know. But if you ask me... tsk tsk, you're asking the right person!"

Xia Ge handed him two middle-grade spirit stones as a reward, "Well, Senior Brother, I've been busy lately, so consider this a treat for you to drink."

Having received the reward, Lu Qie didn't keep her in suspense anymore and said straightforwardly: "That garment demon is called the Radiance of the Firmament."

Xia Ge didn't change her expression and said: "What a good name."

... So, as expected.

Radiance of the Firmament.

The spark that led to the destruction of the Ye family.

After the case of the destroyed Ye family was over, and the Chang family had been silent for a while, they couldn't help but find an excuse and bring the ancient garment demon that had been hidden for eight years back to the world.
"Once this clothing demon appears, it will be a big deal," Lu Qie sighed. "Have you heard about Miss Chu from the Chu family?"

Xia Ge was taken aback. "Miss Chu from the Chu family?"

Chu Yao?

"Yes, previously Chu Yao was sent to guard the Ku Zhu Village, but everyone was taken away by the White Dream Cave..." Lu Qie said. "Due to this unexpected incident, she will have to take partial responsibility. Our senior sister was also supposed to take some responsibility, but she safely brought the people back, so it balanced out... Ahem, I'm off-topic."

"So, what does this have to do with the clothing demon?" Xia Ge asked.

"Originally, it had nothing to do with it," Lu Qie shook her finger. "Until the Chang family got their hands on the Ancient Clothing Demon, the Chu family immediately sent a summons to Miss Chu, saying that due to the negligence of Ku Zhu Village, she must return home to be punished."

"..." Xia Ge was speechless.

Lu Qie didn't notice Xia Ge's subtle expression and continued, "The fact that Miss Chu from the Chu family was summoned back by her family seems to be related to the Chang family obtaining the clothing demon. The power struggle and division of influence between these families is quite intriguing."

Xia Ge stopped walking.

Lu Qie took a few steps and noticed that Xia Ge had stopped. "Xia Xiao Commandant?"

Xia Ge smiled, pretending to be organizing the files in her arms, and casually asked, "When was the summons issued?"

"Yesterday," Lu Qie said. "Didn't you hear about it? Hmm, we're packing up today and will probably leave tomorrow?"

"Oh..." Xia Ge held the files, her thoughts drifting.

The two continued walking.

When they reached the fork in the road, Xia Ge said, "I'll go and deliver it to Senior Sister in the study. Is she there? Lu Senior Brother, you can go back first."

Lu Qie glanced at her. "In the study... Xia Commandant, this is a bit inappropriate..."

Xia Ge smiled. "What's wrong with this? Don't worry."

Only after Lu Qie left did Xia Ge stand still for a while, holding the files in her arms.
System: "Are you not leaving?"

Xia Ge snapped out of his thoughts and said, "Let's go, let's go."

After taking a few turns, Xia Ge arrived at the study.

The frangipani flowers in front of the study had withered quite a bit, but colorful chrysanthemums were blooming brilliantly. A young girl was standing in front of the green window, holding a red pen and still reviewing.

The sunlight was warm.

Gu Peijiu seemed to have sensed something, and she looked up to see a young boy outside the window, wearing a red maple robe and his face hidden behind a thick scroll.

Gu Peijiu remained silent for a moment and calmly said, "...What about Lu?"

Bixi opened the door for Xia Ge, who carried the thick scrolls inside and placed them steadily on the mahogany table. "Ah? Him? I sent him away," Xia Ge said.

The young boy turned around to face her, with a bright smile on his face. "It's not that heavy, and as a special enrollment student, I'm supposed to serve my senior sister."

Those cat-like eyes smiled.

It was as if all the flowers in Danfeng had bloomed.

Gu Peijiu's heart warmed slightly, but she frowned and said, "Don't help him again next time."

Xia Ge laughed and teased, "Oh, senior sister cares about me?"

Gu Peijiu said, "Mm."

Xia Ge was momentarily at a loss for words, even with his thick skin.

The atmosphere was awkward for a moment.

But it seemed like only she felt awkward. She stole a glance at her senior sister, who had already started reviewing the scrolls as if nothing had happened.

After a moment, Xia Ge cleared his throat and changed the subject. "What are you reviewing, senior sister?"

Gu Peijiu said, "Tomorrow is your promotion ceremony, and these are some materials for preparation."

She paused and smiled slightly. "Danfeng rarely has a mysterious-level alchemist, so we should celebrate."
"Preparing well is not necessary..." Xia Ge leaned over to Gu Peiju's side and ground ink for her. "Hey, Senior Sister, I heard that a new ancient clothing demon has appeared. Is it true?"

As she approached, a faint sandalwood scent wafted out, mixing with the ink fragrance.

Clear and lingering.

A very pleasant smell.

Gu Peiju responded with a "hmm," "The Radiance of the Firmament."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge suddenly felt a little sorry for giving two pieces of spirit stones to Lu Qie.

Senior Sister knew why she asked Lu Qie!

Xia Ge asked, "I heard that it was the young master of the Chang family who got it in the White Dream Cave?"

Gu Peiju's eyes deepened slightly, "Maybe."

When they left the White Dream Cave and were taken away by the Heavenly Executioner's Blade, Chang Nian was in the illusion. The illusion of the White Dream Cave was connected to the past and was already like a dream, so anything could happen.

But...

Gu Peiju paused and glanced at her, "Why do you care about this?"

Xia Ge blinked, "Just curious."

The little girl had big eyes, and her facial features were becoming softer and softer. She looked less and less like a boy.

This child's lip color was very pretty.

Suddenly, her heart beat faster.

Gu Peiju immediately withdrew her gaze and suddenly asked an unrelated question, "How old are you this year?"

Xia Ge was stunned, "Thirteen."

Thirteen.

So young.
Gu Peijiu whispered, "After the New Year, I'll be fourteen."

Xia Ge ground the ink and made a sound. She put the ink stick aside and said, "The New Year is still far away."

The New Year, Xia Ge thought. Without any relatives, what's the point of celebrating the New Year?

The only thing that could be considered a New Year celebration was buying good wine and food with Ye Ze, getting drunk, and then sleeping well.

That's about it.

Gu Peijiu finished reviewing the document in her hand and said, "It will be done soon."

She paused and asked, "Has your birthday passed?"

Xia Ge made a sound and suddenly smiled. "Why does senior sister suddenly ask about this?"

Gu Peijiu replied, "I just wanted to know."

Xia Ge pursed her lips and smiled. "It was on May 1st."

It had already passed.

The two fell silent. Gu Peijiu took the documents Xia Ge had brought over and reviewed them from the beginning. Xia Ge couldn't sit still and went to the study to look at books or stare at the chrysanthemums outside.

"Senior sister, when did you transplant the chrysanthemums?"

After a while, Xia Ge had already gone outside the study and was trying to pluck a slender petal from a pink chrysanthemum. Gu Peijiu said, "The oleanders are about to wither. Yesterday, Bixi had someone transplant them here."

"They're really pretty." Xia Ge heartlessly plucked two petals. "So, senior sister, have you heard about the things happening at Sword Peak?"

The fact that Chu Yao, a potential disciple of Sword Peak, was recalled by her family.

Gu Peijiu ignored Xia Ge's euphemism and asked, "Do you want to go?"

Xia Ge hesitated. Gu Peijiu had said before that she shouldn't go to Sword Peak again.

Xia Ge laughed it off and drifted away with a guilty look. "What are you talking about, senior sister? I didn't say anything. I didn't even mention that I wanted to go..."
This is what you want to do.

Gu Peijiu put down her red brush and looked at the boy squatting outside the window making chrysanthemum knots. Her voice was faint, "If you want to go, then go. You don't need to ask me."

Xia Ge: "......"

After speaking, Gu Peijiu closed the scroll. "Bixi, is it time?"

Bixi, who was sweeping the floor, was taken aback. "Ah? What... Oh, still..."

Suddenly seeing her mistress's eyes, Bixi swallowed the "in a moment" that was about to come out of her throat and looked at the sky very cooperatively, then pretended to be very anxious and said, "It's time, Miss. Otherwise, the master will be waiting impatiently."

"Okay."

Gu Peijiu said, "I have something else to do, you can go back."

The study was locked, and Gu Peijiu brushed past Xia Ge with her clothes. Bixi followed behind, and the two were about to leave.

Xia Ge: "I..."

Gu Peijiu took two steps, then stopped again. Her voice was shallow and emotionless, "If you want to go, go tonight."

Because that person was leaving tomorrow.

After Gu Peijiu finished speaking, she felt that there was no need to remind the other person. Her black eyes were slightly cold, and her pace quickened.

The overflowing emotions in her heart were inexplicable.

Gu Peijiu thought.

Something was very wrong.

This was very wrong. There was no reason, no explanation, just anger. This was very irrational, very impulsive, and very unlike her.

But she couldn't control it.

Just like the time she smashed the wine jug in the restaurant.

As long as she thought about it... she felt that she couldn't control it.

- She, Gu Peijiu, just couldn't stand seeing that child with others. Even if she only saw that child have a little thought...
They would feel uncomfortable.

They would also feel a little pain.

Lovelessness gives way to desire.

Is this... possessiveness?

Gu Peijiu stopped in her tracks.

Bixi followed behind, asking curiously, "Miss...? Why did you just..."

Master Fu clearly wanted us to wait a while before going over.

Gu Peijiu raised her head and silently gazed at the misty mountains in the distance.

That was Jianfeng.

As her eyes looked at the ethereal mountains, her mind thought of the scene where the child and Chu Yao were drinking and chatting in the tavern that day.

Possessiveness born of love.

After a while, Gu Peijiu furrowed her brows.

"It's nothing. Let's go."

She thought.

She, Gu Peijiu, seemed to be really... done for.

In front of the study.

The person had left, and Xia Ge was squatting in front of the chrysanthemums, still holding two petals in her hand.

Xia Ge asked, "...Why does senior sister look so angry?"

Was it because she had shown a desire to go to Jianfeng, despite senior sister having said not to go before?

Just because of that?

It couldn't be.
That is...

The system's voice was lazy, "What else can it be? Because you are trash."

Xia Ge remained calm, "You are the trash."

The system retorted, "Don't play dumb, why else would Jianfeng be angry with you? Do you think it's because of the beautiful scenery at Jianfeng that you want to go see it? Even a fool wouldn't believe that, you trash."

Xia Ge was confused, "???"

The system clarified, "The point is not Jianfeng, it's the person."

Xia Ge replied, "I know it's about the person."

She knew that her senior sister was probably angry because she wanted to go see someone at Jianfeng.

But why would she be angry just because Xia Ge wanted to visit a friend?

Was it because her senior sister didn't like the person at Jianfeng?

Xia Ge stood up, holding the flower petals in her hand, and asked in confusion, "So, I just don't understand."
