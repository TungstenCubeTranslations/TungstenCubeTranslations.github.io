After Xia Ge left, Chang Lan walked out from the side, with a hint of blue in her eyes and looking like she hadn't slept well for several nights.

Master Fu stroked his beard. "Chang Feng, you have also worked hard."

Chang Lan remained silent for a moment. "It wasn't hard."

"Xia Chief's words, I'm sure Chang Feng has heard them too. I won't repeat them... I hope Chang Feng will think twice before acting next time." Master Fu shook his head. "Come with me to get the elixir."

Xia Ge did not find Mao Qing at the academy, so she asked around and went to several places where Mao Qing might have gone. Finally, she unexpectedly saw her at the door of her dormitory.

The girl seemed to be looking at something and stood under a parasol tree lost in thought.

"Why are you here?" Xia Ge was a bit surprised.

Mao Qing turned her head and smiled at her. "You're back?"

Xia Ge walked up to her and also smiled. "Were you waiting for me?"

Mao Qing made a sound of agreement. "Did you bring the painting?"

Xia Ge suddenly realized. "I brought it. You came here specifically to wait for me, I thought you were resting somewhere."

"I didn't wait specifically for you." Mao Qing said, "I just felt a bit bored and came to take a look."

"Yeah, it's boring if we can't go down the mountain." Xia Ge took out the painting and handed it to Mao Qing. "It's done, it looks really good."

"I think so too." Mao Qing said.

Just as Mao Qing was speaking, Xia Ge suddenly felt that something was wrong. She leaned over and picked up a palm-sized piece of fabric from the tangled grass. "What is this?"

Mao Qing's pupils shrank slightly. "I don't know, maybe someone tore it off their clothes."

"It's so dirty, throw it away quickly."

"That's not right, there's blood on it." Xia Ge put the fabric under the scattered sunlight shining through the parasol tree. "There aren't many people passing by here, but there's a sense of unease..."

Before she could finish saying the word "feeling", the piece of fabric suddenly seemed to come to life and wrapped itself tightly around Xia Ge's hand!

In an instant, she felt as if something disgusting had wrapped around her hand, and a nauseating feeling from the depths of her soul surged up! Xia Ge's face suddenly became extremely ugly, and she instinctively tried to pull it off, but no matter how hard she pulled, she couldn't get it off. "What is this?!"

Mao Qing said, "Quickly see if you can..."
"What are you saying?"

"I can't hear you."

Xia Ge's pupils shrank, and the outside world seemed to blur completely. The piece of cloth wrapped around her hand kept expanding, and the nauseating feeling seemed to be getting worse, like a scream from the depths of her soul—

Destroy it!!

Otherwise, it will either destroy you or you will destroy it!

"Quickly...call my name..."

A blurry voice, full of longing and greed.

Your name?

What name?

"Please...remember it..."

The exact same voice.

In that dream, the exact same voice.

The already confused soul lost consciousness for a moment, and the shaking all over her body was filled with tempting voices.

"My name is...Huo..."

"Host!! Snap out of it! Don't let it devour your soul!"

The system's voice was like thunder, piercing and sharp, stimulating Xia Ge's confused soul. Almost instinctively, she grabbed the piece of cloth and shook it fiercely, causing spiritual energy to ripple. "Get away from me!"

The next moment, there was a sound of wind! The white cloth was fiercely shaken off by Xia Ge!

After shaking off the cloth, Xia Ge's mind was still a little confused. Mao Qing hurriedly went up to support her, looking very anxious. "Are you okay?"

Xia Ge had already exhausted her soul power from refining the soul pill before, and now she was hit by a sudden spiritual attack from the cloth demon. Her whole head was dizzy, and everything in front of her was pitch black. "What kind of thing is it..."

The discarded cloth did not give up. With a whistling sound, Mao Qing turned around and saw a vortex of wind opening up!

The wind grew stronger and stronger, and by the time Xia Ge could see clearly, the wind vortex had already grown to a meter square, and the suction force had become immense!
Xia Ge's green eyes flashed with a reconnaissance, and in the next moment, her pupils suddenly contracted!

Ma Qing wanted to say something, but before she could speak, she was lifted up and carried away by the shadows of the trees!

"What's going on... What is that? Where are you going?" Ma Qing asked.

The wind hole was right behind them, not giving an inch!

Xia Ge gritted her teeth and used her Ghost Shadow technique to the limit, rushing towards the back mountain!

- What is that?

Xia Ge didn't see the white fabric, so she didn't know what kind of clothes it was. The first thing she saw was the wind hole!

[White Dream Hole: The dwelling place of ancient gods, it is said to be able to create illusions, travel through time, and after experiencing some changes, the cave became strange, often leading to no return.]

That wind hole... was actually the legendary dwelling place of the gods, the White Dream Hole!!

But why was the White Dream Hole being controlled by a clothes demon? No, not just "a" clothes demon, it looked like it was just a fragment!

Xia Ge ran as fast as she could with Ma Qing on her back, but the clothes demon with the White Dream Hole was still chasing them relentlessly.

System: "Is it coming for you?"

Xia Ge: "...I don't know, let's just get to a safe place first!"

She had the system to rely on, so even if things got worse, she would still have some room to maneuver, but if Ma Qing got hurt and she got involved, then she would be in big trouble!

Ma Qing: "What is that?"

Xia Ge said, "...The White Dream Hole!"

In the end, one cannot outrun the wind, and a huge suction force came from behind. Xia Ge vaguely felt that she couldn't avoid it anymore. In the second before she was about to be swallowed by the White Dream Hole, Xia Ge suddenly stepped on a tree branch, used the force to throw Ma Qing out, and then she herself was swallowed up by the wind hole!

"You run fast!"

In the moment when Xia Ge was swallowed up, Ma Qing felt her brain go blank for a moment.

For a moment, she couldn't believe that there were such foolish people.
Xia Ge had already taken her to the back mountain, so even when she was thrown out, she spun lightly in mid-air and landed on the ground.

There really are people who are willing to risk everything for others.

Mao Qing was silent for a moment in front of the wind cave, then she touched her chest and asked herself, "Are you an important person to her?"

No, she wasn't.

According to her memories, she wasn't.

It was just a simple student relationship, yet it made Mao Qing risk everything.

It could be called selfless, or simply foolish.

After Xia Ge was swallowed up, the suction from the wind cave disappeared instantly, as if it had completed a task and was satisfied.

Mao Qing felt inexplicably annoyed.

She narrowed her eyes slightly, raised a slender finger, and the slowly closing wind cave was suddenly hooked onto something and forcibly enlarged!

She chuckled lightly, and a hint of a demonic color that didn't belong to her appeared in her eyes.

"...Bai Meng Cave?"

"Since it's so interesting, why not take me along?"

The wind cave hesitated for a moment, as if provoked, and suddenly expanded like a gaping mouth, devouring everything inside!

= =

A never-ending darkness.

A young boy in a red and white outfit, with a doll hanging from his waist, quietly slept in a corner of the rocky cave. The cave was damp, the rocks were jagged, and several bats hung upside down from the rocks, occasionally opening their eyes and emitting a green light.

Xia Ge felt like she had slept for a long time, yet it also felt like it hadn't been long at all.

She had a long dream.

In the dream, she wandered in a bamboo forest with a bone flute hanging from her waist and a basket full of mushrooms on her back.

The sun was gentle, the wind was light, and a little girl with two buns in her hair, wearing a red dress and barefoot, held onto her clothes and followed her every step of the way.
The two of them walked aimlessly for a long time. She picked up some dusty mushrooms and threw them into the basket. The little girl didn't pick any mushrooms, just held onto her clothes quietly. After a while, she suddenly pulled on her clothes, as if asking her to stop.

Helplessly, Xia Ge stopped and asked, "Little miss?"

The little girl pulled her to the side, then squatted down and carefully picked a beautiful mushroom. She silently held it out for her to see.

"Hey, put it down, that mushroom is poisonous," Xia Ge heard herself say.

The little girl held onto the mushroom and didn't let go, just looked at her with her long and narrow eyes, which seemed empty except for stubbornness.

"......The mushroom is poisonous, put it down," Xia Ge said again.

"￥%......" The little girl said two words, then seemed to remember something and closed her mouth.

No one understood what she said.

That era... no longer existed.

In Xia Ge's dream, she obviously couldn't understand this language. She scratched her head in distress, then finally squatted down and said, "Hey... are you saying you want to give it to me?"

- You look pretty.

- You deserve it.

The girl held onto the mushroom and looked at her. Obviously, she understood Xia Ge's meaning, nodded seriously, and then said two words vaguely.

"￥%......) (*￥%......" - This is pretty, just like you.

After speaking, she held the mushroom up high.

Although Xia Ge couldn't understand her words, she could probably understand the little girl's meaning. She couldn't help but slightly curl her lips, and leaned down to take the mushroom. "Are you saying it's pretty?" she asked.

- You are someone who can understand me.

The little girl nodded seriously, then pointed to the mushroom and then to Xia Ge.

"Hey, I see, you mean it's pretty, but I'm much prettier than it," Xia Ge said shamelessly.
- Hmm, yes, you look better now.

- "Since that's the case, I'll reluctantly accept it. Hey, when will you stop being so clingy?"

- "No, I can't."

- The little girl understood her words, shook her head, tightly grabbed her clothes, and pointed ahead.

- "#......" Let's go forward.

- "Okay, let's go, little miss. Remember, this is poisonous mushroom, poison, mushroom, not mushroom, you can't eat it, got it?"

- The little girl nodded seriously and said "Mm-hmm".

- Xia Ge sighed, looked at her feet, and said, "I told you to wear shoes but you won't..."

- The little girl remained silent and shook her head to express her refusal.

- Xia Ge took off the basket on her back and took out a pair of grass shoes. "It doesn't matter where you walk here, there are a lot of bamboo shoots ahead, won't you wear them?"

- The little girl in the red dress still clung to her clothes and shook her head.

- Xia Ge had a headache. "Won't you go back either?"

- The little girl nodded firmly, indicating that she would not go back.

- Xia Ge took off the bamboo basket and squatted down. "Okay, come on."

- The little girl's eyes lit up slightly, but she hesitated, holding her clothes tighter and feeling a bit uneasy.

- "Come on up." Xia Ge was helpless. "I'll carry you, and you can carry the basket, okay?"

- The little girl in the red dress had no objections. She deftly picked up the basket, which wasn't too heavy, and the little girl easily carried it. Xia Ge carried the little girl on her back and walked forward.

- "#￥%......&......"

- The little girl seemed very happy, chattering away on Xia Ge's back.

- Xia Ge couldn't see her expression or understand what she was saying, so she could only nod and agree as they walked forward. However, her mood seemed to be infected by the little girl, and she also became happy.

- Xia Ge sighed, "When will you learn to speak human language?"
The little girl stopped in her tracks and didn't speak anymore. She just tightly gripped her clothes.

After a while, she whispered a word.

"...Yes."

Mengli Xiage's footsteps suddenly stopped as she held the poisonous mushroom, turned around in shock and looked at the little girl on her back. "You can talk?!"

The little girl immediately covered her eyes with her hands.

"Don't cover them! You just touched the poisonous mushroom! Ahhhh..."

The little girl in red looked at her, pursed her lips, and smiled slightly. The narrow eyes gradually filled with gentle sunshine.

"You're very beautiful and gentle."

"You said you can save me."

"Maybe you still love me."

In this vast world, she was the only human who could possibly love her.

She slowly loosened her grip and leaned her head on Xiage's shoulder, feeling that warmth.

"So, if you want to."

"Then, I can."
