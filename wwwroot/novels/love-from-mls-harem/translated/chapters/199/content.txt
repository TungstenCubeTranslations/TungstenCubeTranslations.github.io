The wind blowing in the ears was chilly, and the sun was setting in the west.

Baiyi Xiage's white clothes fell to the ground, fluttering in the breeze, and the amaryllis on the hem of her clothes bloomed brightly.

Through the mountains and forests, there was a small village with smoke rising from the chimneys, indicating signs of life.

Baiyi Xiage squinted her eyes, staring at the rising smoke as if she was a predator stalking her prey, with an unhesitating killing intent and excitement.

Her blood-red pupils fixed on the village, and she moved her hand slightly, but seemed to feel that something was missing and hesitated.

Faint footsteps could be heard, and her pupils suddenly shrank, but her body remained motionless.

"Ah, it's getting hot these days, and it's time to prepare some thin clothes for the wife at home..."

"What time is it? It's still early for the beginning of summer. I think you've been chopping wood too much and got heatstroke!"

It turned out to be two woodcutters returning home. 

The girl's fingers moved slightly, and her blood-red pupils narrowed slightly.

"Hey, it's getting dark, let's hurry back for dinner."

"..."

The butterfly on the girl's shoulder suddenly moved, feeling anxious.

In the conversation, the two woodcutters had already approached.

They were two woodcutters carrying a large basket of firewood, wearing slightly thick blue and green old clothes, chatting all the way, relaxed and cheerful.

"Hey, Lao Xu..."

One woodcutter saw the girl's figure in the dusk at a glance and hesitated, "Is there a girl over there?"

Lao Xu also saw it. The white figure under the dim moonlight made him instinctively feel uneasy. "Lao Chen...let's go home quickly."

The mountains and forests were full of evil spirits, so it was always good to be cautious.

The two men lightened their footsteps and were about to walk away-

But things happened too quickly!
"Ah -"

In the next moment, a woodcutter was firmly pressed to the ground by the girl. Her eyes were red and ruthless, and her slender hands slowly tightened. Another man named Lao Xu was scared but quick to react, shouting, "Lao Chen!"

He then picked up his hatchet from his waist and swung it at Xia Ge!

The white clothes on Xia Ge suddenly shone with a dazzling blood light, and the hatchet was violently bounced off. Lao Xu tumbled in the air and fell to the ground, immediately passing out.

Lao Chen was being strangled, his face turning purple, his eyes bulging, looking in the direction of Lao Xu with a desperate and angry expression.

The girl didn't care as she held Lao Chen's neck and lifted him up, a faint smile appearing on her lips.

Devoid of all humanity, she acted purely on instinct, like a wild beast with a desire to kill.

And she found pleasure in it.

The phantom of Chu Yi suddenly appeared, "Stop it! Brother!!"

The Hundred Ghosts Cave was not our kind, and if they died, they died. But -

Chu Yi knew.

If these two people died, her brother would wake up and regret it!!

Chu Yi said, "Brother, stop it! You can't do this! You will regret it!"

Xia Ge ignored her, the hand that was strangling Lao Chen's neck slowly tightening, while the other hand moved slightly, as if measuring something.

Lao Chen's eyes rolled back and he passed out.

What should they do?! What should they do!

Chu Yi gritted her teeth, "If you do that, Brother - the person you like will never wake up again!!"

As soon as she spoke, her heart ached.

She didn't want to say that name.

- She had a meager hope that the other party wouldn't react to that sentence, and also hoped that she wouldn't continue to destroy herself.

It was just a momentary struggle.
The girl's movement paused slightly, and she slowly lifted her head. Her blood-red eyes seemed momentarily confused as she looked at Chu Yi.

Staring at Xia Ge's blood-red pupils, Chu Yi's heart was as lifeless as ashes. Then, she laughed at herself and simply abandoned everything, saying each word carefully, "If Brother uses more force, she will never see you again."

"She will be disappointed in Brother."

"...she will never, never wake up again."

As soon as she finished speaking, the white-clad girl immediately released the person in her hand, and her sharp claws instantly grabbed towards Chu Yi!

Chu Yi didn't dodge, looking at the other party's angry eyes, letting the fierce claw wind pass through her illusory body.

- You see, she didn't even say who she was.

Is this instinct?

With a swipe of her claws, Xia Ge stared at Chu Yi for a long time. She probably realized that the attack was ineffective and didn't want to waste her energy. She turned her head and prepared to kill the two people who had fainted behind her.

She felt very unhappy.

Although she didn't know why.

She grabbed Old Xu's neck and was about to use a little force-

At this moment.

"Do you feel like something's missing?" The girl's voice rang out leisurely.

White-clad Xia Ge's pupils shrank slightly, and she subconsciously turned sideways to let go of the person in her hand. However, it was useless. A vine with countless Higanbana bloomed suddenly from the ground under her feet. The seemingly weak emerald vine was as strong as steel and jade. Xia Ge waved her sleeve, and the gusts of wind couldn't even cut off half of the vine. Instead, it grew rapidly, and for a moment, it seemed that the creeping vine was everywhere. Xia Ge was completely blocked!

It didn't take long for her to be tightly bound in the middle.

Under the dim sunset and the swaying tree shadows, the girl in red appeared gracefully, holding a blood-red Higanbana flower in her hand.

"Let go, Miss Chu," Su Chan said casually. "You can't control her, and you can't save her."

The dried leaf butterfly on Xia Ge's shoulder fluttered its wings, and Chu Yi pressed her lips together, looking at Su Chan with cold eyes.

Su Chan asked, "What can you get by taking her away like this?"

Chu Yi said, "As long as she is away from you."
"Good reason," Su Chan smiled, "but I think Miss Chu has gone through so much trouble for more than just that."

Chu Yi looked at her, with Baiyi Xiaga struggling behind her and two unconscious woodcutters below.

She tightly clenched her fists.

"Although Miss Chu is ruthless, she must have some genuine feelings for the person she likes to go this far," Su Chan said. "I'm sure she doesn't want to be like this forever."

"I'll find a way myself, there's no need for the Master to worry," Chu Yi said.

"There is no way," Su Chan let go, and the amaryllis in her hand fell silently. She had a faint smile on her lips. "In this world, the only one who can save her is me."

Perhaps, there was also Gu Peijiu.

It was just a pity that she would never wake up.

Chu Yi fell silent.

Baiyi Xiaga was still struggling, her eyes fixed on the two people on the ground, her desire to kill simple and obvious.

She killed not for anything else, but simply for the sake of killing.

There was no cure.

"I heard that the leader of Qianhun Sect is conducting some strange experiments..." Chu Yi couldn't bear to look any longer, paused, her voice gentle but with a subtle, dangerous chill. "The leader swears that he can save people... I wonder if my brother's condition has anything to do with the leader's efforts?"

"You're accusing me wrongly," Su Chan casually smiled. "How can it be my fault? If anything, it's your in-law's good fortune."

"My in-law?" Chu Yi frowned.

"I heard that your young miss has married into the Chang family, so what else would you call it?" Su Chan laughed. "Let's put that aside for now. Have you ever heard of the 'Clothes Ghost and Misfortune'?"

Misfortune?!

With Su Chan's reminder, Chu Yi suddenly turned around and stared at the clothes ghost on Baiyi Xiaga's body.

She had long felt that the clothes ghost on Xiaoga's body was abnormal and vaguely familiar, thinking it was one of Su Chan's dirty tricks. Now, thanks to her reminder...

The scene of her cooperation with the Misfortune three years ago reappeared in her mind.
At that time, the target of the curse was clear - Xia Ge. At that time, she only thought of herself as a purposeful demon, but later she checked the books and found out what it really was.

The curse was a demon born from the curse of the heavens, bringing disaster to the human world. It was bloodthirsty and enjoyed killing, and it would absorb people's negative emotions to strengthen itself!

After finding out that Xia Ge was her brother, she had no more dealings with the curse, but she didn't expect it to still succeed!

It was really the curse!

"It is a demon born from the curse of the heavens, bringing disaster to one side, born for killing, and taking pleasure in people's pain. - I couldn't come up with such a trick." Su Chanman said casually, "I personally arranged the Soul-Sealing Formation in the Thousand Souls Sect to seal it, but I didn't expect Miss Chu Yi to intervene and really surprised me."

"Why did the curse target my brother?" Chu Yi asked, "And what does this have to do with the Chang family?"

"Why did it target him?" Su Chan smirked and hid the fact that Xia Ge was Xia Wushuang, saying only, "The curse was given to our family's little priest as a birthday gift by the Chang family's patriarch back then..." Su Chan paused, "As for the twists and turns, it's a small matter. If you check the Hundred Ghosts Cave, everything will be clear."

She glanced at the fainted woodcutter on the ground and smiled slightly, "Miss Chu Yi is a smart person and should understand that taking her away now would be meaningless and only bring needless bloodshed and more brutal rumors."

"..."

Chu Yi stared at Su Chan, her fists clenched tightly, "Fine, then I'll ask you again. Why did you force her to this point?"

Su Chan went too far in the battle at the Evil Spirit Mountain.

Did Su Chan force her because she knew Xia Ge would end up like this?

After all, the curse had been targeting Xia Ge for three years.

Su Chan squinted and smiled, "I know you want to ask me if I knew about the curse's disaster and forced her to come back."

Chu Yi said, "Isn't that the case?"

"No," Su Chan smiled, her eyes indifferent, "I don't need too many reasons. I wanted to do it, so I did it."

At that time, Xia Ge was just a somewhat familiar stranger to her, a little priest of the evil sect who was exiled.

Even if she found out later...

She had to do it even more.

Chu Yi said, "The leader doesn't seem like the kind of person who would explain so much to me here."
"I think so too." Su Chan smiled softly, "I don't even know why I did it."

Chu Yi looked deeply at Su Chan and said, "You have to promise to make her return to her original state."

Su Chan smiled, "Of course."

Chu Yi turned around and looked at Xia Ge.

The girl in white did not react to her gaze, she just looked at the people on the ground, then looked at her own hands, and then desperately pulled at the tough and flexible vines.

Chu Yi clenched her fists slightly, remembering the gentle and tough boy from her childhood.

The light in her memory... why did it become like this now?

Chang family.

Chu Yi's gaze turned slightly cold.

Su Chan's words couldn't be completely trusted, but since she said so, she must have her reasons.

Chu Yi had a plan in her heart.

The withered leaf butterfly on Xia Ge's shoulder fluttered its wings and disappeared.

After Chu Yi left, Su Chan sighed and walked over.

The girl in white, Xia Ge, raised her head vigilantly and stared at her, her muscles tense, her red pupils erect, like an angry cat.

The messy vines of the spider lilies automatically made way for her. She walked in front of Xia Ge, who was bound by the vines, and reached out to touch her head.

"Good girl."

Almost as soon as she touched her, Xia Ge fiercely bit into her wrist like a jade-white wrist!

Her teeth sank deeply into Su Chan's pulse.

As if there was an indelible hatred.

Su Chan didn't mind and let her bite. Blood oozed out, with a sweet fragrance of fresh blood. Xia Ge was like a soothed kitten, her contracted pupils slowly dilating, enjoying the comfortable feeling of body and mind.

Su Chan, as if she couldn't feel the pain, said to herself, "I shouldn't have said so much to her."
She had always been lazy to intervene in the family disputes, and the demonic sect usually just watched the major families and sects fight each other, and then reaped the benefits.

Anyway, whenever there was a problem, the demonic sect was always blamed for it.

As the saying goes, when you have too many fleas, you don't feel itchy; when you have too many debts, you don't worry; and when you have too many blames, it doesn't matter, because no one can do anything to the demonic sect with Su Chan in charge.

The incident where Chang Family implicated the demonic sect in the past was Qin Yue's own stupidity, and she had nothing to do with it, so she didn't bother to care.

But now...

Su Chan looked at the heartless girl in front of her.

Thinking of the child who was full of passion back then, now turned into such a cold and merciless bloodthirsty appearance.

She wanted to make Chang Family taste what pain was like.

This was just the beginning.

After biting for a while and seeing that Su Chan didn't feel any pain, Xia Ge became unhappy instead, loosened her mouth, and was not very happy.

She wanted to see the moment when others died, the pain, the fear, and all the negative emotions.

That would make her happier and stronger.

But this person was clearly bitten, yet showed no signs of pain, but instead seemed to be enjoying it.

This made Xia Ge unhappy.

"I'm not in pain," Su Chan's voice was gentle. "Don't worry about me. How about biting my other hand?"

Xia Ge: "......"

= =

In her past life...

"After Xia Wushuang was appointed as a general, she became a leisurely one, handing over the control of the puppets and naturally someone else led the army. In recent years, more and more people have come to seek her teachings. With nothing else to do, she established Lingxi Peak."

"At that time, Lingxi only had one puppet peak, but the true puppetry was so profound that few people could really inherit Xia Wushuang's essence. Those who could come from far away to seek her teachings were mostly born in wealthy families. If they couldn't learn well and went back, they would inevitably be ridiculed by others, so they didn't want to leave. Later, Xia Wushuang felt that this was not a solution, so she created Jianfeng and invited a master to come and teach. In order not to hurt the face of those wealthy children, Xia Wushuang chose the highest mountain and said that standing high would enable them to learn further."

"It can be considered a win-win situation."
"Doudou said.

Gu Peijiu: "..."

"In fact, this is nothing." Doudou's voice was faint. "All the changes happened nine years later."

"Nine years later?" Gu Peijiu asked.

"Yes."

"Chu Shi was officially established as the king of Chu because of his great military achievements, but at this time... there were changes. The indestructible puppet soldiers began to lose control. King Chu personally invited Xia Wushuang to come forward and solve this problem."

"At that time, the Fengyue Continent had basically been flattened by King Chu, and only a few small countries with strong military forces were still stubbornly resisting. King Chu was ambitious and wanted to incorporate the last piece of land into his territory."

"Although she knew that King Chu had come with a request... she was still very happy that day." Doudou said.

Gu Peijiu remained silent.

"In fact, Xia Wushuang didn't really want to leave the Lingxi Peak. This was where she had lived for a long time." Doudou said, "But she still agreed."

"..."

"It's just a war, and when it's over, she can still live her peaceful life." Doudou lowered her eyebrows.

"If only things were that simple." Gu Peijiu had a bad feeling in her heart.

At the same time, the scenery around them began to change.

It was a desolate northern battlefield.

Xia Wushuang agreed to personally control the puppet soldiers and lead the charge, but most of the control was actually in Gu Peijiu's hands.

The other side had long known the power of Chu's puppet soldiers and had spent a lot of money to hire three thousand puppet masters to control the puppets as the vanguard to resist. Although the number was not thirty thousand, they were all new soldiers. However, some of Xia Wushuang's puppet soldiers were inexplicably out of control.

But even so, under Gu Peijiu's precise operation, there were no uncontrollable accidents.

This was a protracted battle. Our forces were strong, but the enemy forces were not weak either. The two sides were deadlocked, and after three days and three nights, there was no progress.

Fortunately, puppets do not need to eat or drink, and only the enemy puppet masters were exhausted.
However, Xia Wushuang, with Gu Peiju, was not tired.

She just didn't quite understand where the problem of losing control was coming from. She had checked a puppet soldier for a long time but found nothing.

Su Chan entered the tent. "Haven't found the problem yet? Why don't you stop looking?"

The young girl no longer looked like a child. She had grown a little taller, but still had a tender and delicate appearance.

Xia Wushuang was wearing a green dress, with a slender figure and a sharp sword at her waist wrapped in a green bamboo sheath. She lowered her head and asked the lying puppet soldier, "Where does it hurt?"

The puppet soldier groaned twice and stared at Xia Wushuang's chest, saying, "I'm in pain all over."

Su Chan slapped him hard, not lightly at all. The puppet soldier flew out of the tent and rolled on the ground.

Now he really hurt all over.

Xia Wushuang scratched her head, puzzled. "I don't think there's a problem. All the parts have been replaced with new ones. How could it suddenly lose control?"

Su Chan said expressionlessly, "I think he has no problem except in his brain."

Xia Wushuang said, "..."

Xia Wushuang had a sudden realization. "Brain! Is it a soul thing!?"

Su Chan said, "Don't think about it. The King of Chu's reinforcements will arrive soon, at most half a day. After the battle, we won't have to worry about these things anymore."

Xia Wushuang was immersed in puppet research and couldn't help herself. "Hurry up and find him. I'll check if there's anything wrong with his brain."

Su Chan immediately regretted not hitting the puppet soldier's head. "No problem! He doesn't have any problem with his brain! He only has a problem with being beaten up!"

The King of Chu's reinforcements arrived soon. With the army and the bravery of the King of Chu, although they encountered resistance, they quickly took down this small country.

In the end, Xia Wushuang still didn't figure out whether there was a problem with the other side's brain.

The job given to Xia Wushuang by the King of Chu was simple. She just had to control the puppet soldiers to hold out and wait for the army to arrive.

After taking down the small country, the transfer of power between the victorious and defeated countries was no longer within Xia Wushuang's jurisdiction, and it took a few days to sort everything out.

Xia Wushuang applied to the King of Chu to return home first.
"The north is cold." Xia Wushuang's resignation letter was brief and to the point. "I hope to return soon."

It was a formal and business-like letter.

After receiving the letter, the Chu King looked at the handwriting for a long time in silence. Finally, he approved it with a "yes."

A eunuch eagerly draped a thick cloak over the Chu King's shoulders. "Your Majesty, it's snowing."

Holding the letter with the "yes" stamp, the Chu King looked out the window.

The snow was sparse and gentle. A plum blossom was blooming brightly in the corner.

It rarely snowed in Chang'an.

But all the beautiful snowy nights in his memory were spent with that person.

The Chu King tightly squeezed the letter in his hand, thinking of Xia Wushuang's sword, "Wenqing," at her waist. For a moment, his heart felt dull pain.

She never asked, and she never mentioned it.

"It's snowing."

Xia Wushuang stuck her head out of the carriage and looked outside, feeling a bit joyful.

"It's getting dark. Let's find a place to rest," Gu Peiju said.

"Why take a carriage? Just teleport back," Su Chan asked.

"Hehehe, you think I really want to go back?" Xia Wushuang tucked her head back into the carriage, and the snowflakes made her hair as white as snow. She acted affectionately, "I just want to see the beautiful scenery of the north!"

Gu Peiju silently covered her head with a soft handkerchief and wiped away the snow water for her.

Su Chan: "..."

The carriage was large and luxurious, stable without any bumps. It was perfect for sightseeing. It seemed that the Chu King also knew her little thoughts and even provided a few people to accompany her.

After playing and walking all the way, they finally saw a small village and decided to stop and camp there.

Xia Wushuang liked to be alone, while Su Chan and Gu Peiju looked at each other uneasily. Therefore, the three of them simply set up three tents.
By the time everything was settled down, the sky had turned completely dark.

Xia Wushuang yawned lazily and entered the tent, casually mentioning tomorrow's plan: "Let's go play in the small village... no, let's go to the countryside to investigate the local situation."

Gu Peiju: "..."

Su Chan: "As you wish."

No one noticed the sadness in Xia Wushuang's eyes.

On this quiet night, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

Several puppet soldiers guarded outside.

Gu Peiju didn't need to rest, so she stayed in the tent, looking at herself in the mirror.

The girl in the mirror had fair skin, her black hair was tied up with a wooden hairpin, and the light in her dark eyes was faint.

A slight movement was heard in the quiet snowy night.

Gu Peiju immediately stood up alertly and left the tent.

A row of emerald green eyes shone brightly on the bright snowy ground, almost blinding.

It was wolves!
