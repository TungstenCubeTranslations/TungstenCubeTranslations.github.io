Realizing that there was nothing left to give herself an excuse to procrastinate and delay until Ye Ze finished class, Xia Ge reluctantly began to tidy up the "Reflection Pavilion".

However, it was impossible to make Xia Ge quiet.

Apart from when she was eating buns, she was as calm as a lady. At all other times, well...

Xia Ge propped up the remaining intact table, looked at the debris on the ground, and lamented: "Xiao Kui, are you a monkey sent by Senior Sister? Why did you let me sweep you when she told me to?"

The system coldly caught the point: "I'm not a monkey."

Xia Ge said, "You weren't like this before."

System: "......"

Xia Ge said, "Were you tempted by her? I remember you gave her an SSS beauty rating."

It was useless to say more, so the system chose silence.

Xia Ge said, "You're so biased. You gave me a rating of 'none'. Do you dislike me?"

The system was very happy this time: "Yes."

Xia Ge said, "Don't be like this. We're still friends."

System: indifferent.jpg

Dragging it out all morning, Xia Ge didn't see any sign of Ye Ze, the savior and cleaning expert. She estimated that the other party wasn't coming, so she tidied up the "Reflection Pavilion" with great fatigue.

When she came back to her senses, Ye Ze's lunch break had ended.

Sigh... It would be so nice if she could pull the male lead over to help.

Xia Ge felt melancholy for a moment.

That female assassin was really powerful. While sweeping the floor, Xia Ge leisurely calculated that the female assassin kicked and shattered thirteen pear wood desks. The strength and ruthlessness were unbelievable.

With such a deadly kicking method, did she not leave any way out for the clothes demon?

In the end, she even blamed Xia Ge for killing the clothes demon. What kind of logic was that?

Xia Ge instinctively ignored the fact that the damage to the body was not added to the clothes demon, and after condemning the other party's unreasonable behavior in her heart, she put the broom used to clean the "Reflection Pavilion" back in its original place, rubbed her eyes and yawned, and finally walked out of the "Reflection Pavilion" with the glass wood in her hand.
Looking at the tragic sunset in the distance, Xia Ge squinted her eyes.

"But... why did the little girl from Jianfeng pretend to be an assassin and come to the Sigu Pavilion?" she asked.

The system was surprised, "How do you know she's from Lingxi Peak? Or Jianfeng?"

"It's simple, she didn't kill me," Xia Ge said confidently. "She kept saying she was going to kill me, had so many chances to do it, but in the end only burned my alchemy notes..."

"If she wasn't from Lingxi Peak, how would she know I was copying books and specifically burn them?" Xia Ge continued.

The system found the logic a bit off, "Why would being from Lingxi Peak mean she knows you were copying books?"

"Because the Sigu Pavilion in Lingxi Peak is where they punish disciples by making them copy books," Xia Ge explained.

Thinking about it, Xia Ge felt a bit bitter, "She's such a ruthless woman! Luckily, I only copied it once. If I had honestly copied it thirty times, even if she saved me, I would still have taken off her veil and handed her over to Senior Sister!"

"Ha? She saved you?" the system asked.

"Little puppet, why didn't I realize you were so stupid before?" Xia Ge sighed.

"She did save me," Xia Ge explained patiently. "That masked person was trying to kill me."

Those poisonous pentagonal darts on the chairs could have easily killed her if she had been even slightly careless.

"So..." Xia Ge said nonchalantly, "She's definitely from Lingxi Peak. I told her about the ancestral saying of 'skinship and life-saving grace' of Lingxi Peak and she didn't deny it."

The system was speechless.

It's true, Lingxi Peak did have such an awkward ancestral saying.

It was said that this was one of the ancestral sayings personally established by the founder of Lingxi Peak five hundred years ago, and every disciple who joined Lingxi Peak, whether they were from the outer or inner sect, had to memorize all of his sayings.

"Only a freak like Jianfeng could produce someone with the strength to kick over a dozen tables with one foot," Xia Ge sighed, then changed the subject. "Little puppet, have you found all the materials? How do we upgrade?"
Are you not curious about which disciple of Jianfeng it is?!

The system suppressed its strong desire for knowledge: "...go find a hidden place, follow the prompts and you'll be fine."

"Ye Ze is about to finish class - so why bother being so tired as an inner disciple, why try to pass the exam..." Xia Ge calculated the date, "Oh, speaking of which, tomorrow seems to be the day of distributing salaries. Does Master Sister Gu Pei... no, won't punish me for my salary?"

The system didn't respond to her.

Xia Ge was used to it. The system was always quiet, and ever since she tricked it a few times, it became even quieter.

Sigh, Little Puppet had become smarter, and with fewer words, it was harder for her to trick it for information. It was really distressing.

"Let's fill our stomachs first."

Danfeng was a very high mountain peak, and Siguoge was built on the mountainside, surrounded by clouds and mist. Basically, all inner disciples were able to refine Pigu Dan or had already refined it, so there wasn't much demand for food.

Ye Ze could also refine Pigu Dan.

Unfortunately, Xia Ge never ate that stuff.

Joking aside, eating was such a wonderful thing!

Why use Pigu Dan, a thing that was against human nature, to suppress people's desire for food?

Without desire, are we still human?

It's really illogical!

Xia Ge believed that, as a highly logical person, she would never eat that rubbish called Pigu Dan.

Why learn to refine it if you don't eat it?

In the end, desire was the source of motivation for progress.

But, speaking of Ye Ze being able to refine Pigu Dan...

To be honest, Xia Ge had seen "Endless Love in the Wind and Moon" and had a general idea of how useless the male lead was in the early stages, but she never thought that he would be so useless.

He really had no talent in alchemy.
When Xia Ge first became an outer disciple of Lingxi Peak, he spent his daily allowance on eating, drinking, and having fun, while Ye Ze worked hard to save money and materials. He spent his days in the Danfeng Library reading "100 Methods of Making Fasting Pills". Xia Ge watched him destroy hundreds of materials for making fasting pills, even though he had become an outer disciple of Danfeng and could afford to eat and drink as he pleased. Ye Ze, on the other hand, was so poor he couldn't even afford a piece of bread.

Xia Ge felt sorry for the money that was wasted, but at the same time, she admired Ye Ze's hard work. She knew what he wanted and what motivated him, but that was not important. What was important was that he was working hard for what he wanted.

So even though he had no talent, Ye Ze passed the first internal alchemy test and became the brightest star among the new disciples, making the perfect fasting pill at the fastest speed.

For the first time, Xia Ge saw Ye Ze, who had always been timid and unremarkable, in a new light. Not because he was the male lead, but because every person who works hard shines in their own way.

So Ye Ze went from having nothing to becoming an inner disciple, and finally became a "master of making fasting pills".

In comparison, Xia Wu Yin, who had been enjoying herself, was still a lazy bum.

However, Xia Ge still preferred a relaxed lifestyle, even though she envied those who worked hard. She picked a dogtail grass and walked slowly down the mountain. At the foot of the mountain was a small village where the outer disciples lived. Their job was to run errands for the inner disciples and maintain order in the surrounding villages and towns, like extras and city management.

Fengyue Continent was a magical place. In "Endless Fengyue", there were no countries, only countless organizations called "Zhi" that governed the land. The various sects were like schools, training the most outstanding and powerful disciples to be sent to the local "Zhi" to protect the people.

Lingxi Peak was also like a school, but it only accepted talented people. Those without talent, who could not pass the internal disciple exam, could only become outer disciples of the sect, doing menial tasks and helping to manage the nearby villages and towns. Of course, they could also do some small business.

Xia Ge spat out the dogtail grass, took out two copper coins from her pocket, and went to the pancake shop at the entrance of the village. "Uncle Xu, do you still have any pancakes left?"

"Hey, you came just in time, you little rascal!" Uncle Xu, with a full beard and a bare chest, tied his thick hair with a dirt-yellow band behind his head. He skillfully wrapped a pancake in oil paper and smiled, "Freshly made pancake - why did you come down so late? Why didn't Ye Ze come down with you?"

"Oh, he's still in class."

The pancake wrapped in oil paper was scorching hot. Xia Ge caught it and threw it a few times before finally grabbing the corner of the paper. She sighed, "He works too hard every day."
Uncle Xu laughed heartily, "You're criticizing others when you're not even working yourself. You're such a lazy kid! You should work hard like Ye Xiaozhi."

"You don't understand, Uncle," Xia Ge touched the oil paper and found that it was no longer hot. He breathed a sigh of relief and said meaningfully, "Working hard doesn't necessarily lead to success, but not working hard will definitely make things easier."

Uncle Xu said, "You only know how to be lazy!"

"I won't argue with you, Uncle. I need to go back and study hard," Xia Ge smiled and peeled open the oil paper, took a bite of the crispy pastry, and bid farewell to Uncle Xu before strolling back leisurely.

Study hard? That's non-existent.

After enjoying the pastry in her room for the night, she planned to drink with the money she earned the next day!

What? Her senior sister asked her to learn alchemy by tracing the stream?

That's non-existent.jpg.

Walking along the stone path with the sounds of chickens and dogs, occasionally greeting familiar faces, Xia Ge took a bite of the pastry and comfortably squinted her eyes.

Her beautiful days were just beginning. She would soon have money, meat, and good wine. Why waste her time on boring alchemy?

Who cares about the future? Live for the moment!

This small village was relatively peaceful. Most of the people here were outer disciples of the Lingxi Peak. When they grew too old to meet the requirements of inner disciples, they settled down here and made a living. Day by day, they lived a comfortable life.

Overall, it was quite stable and suitable for retirement...

"Ah-"

A woman's piercing scream suddenly pierced the silence!

The quiet village suddenly became noisy.

"Ah! A puppet has appeared! Quickly inform the mountain!!"

Xia Ge: "..."

Hmm... Occasionally, there are small disturbances that disrupt the peace.

After the initial panic passed, the villagers around her quickly organized themselves. As outer disciples of Lingxi Peak, they had ample experience in dealing with puppets during their previous battles. They should be able to hold the puppet off until help arrives from the mountain.

So even though it was chaotic, there shouldn't be any major problems, and Xia Ge, being a salted fish, shouldn't have anything to do with it.
Xia Ge walked quietly along the corner, holding a precious pastry that he had just taken two bites of, and headed towards his small house in an orderly manner.

However, before he could take a few steps with his head down, his shoulder was suddenly grabbed by someone. "Kid, don't go in that direction!"

Xia Ge didn't have a chance to lift his head and say anything--

[Blue Alert! C-level puppets are appearing nearby! Host, please choose to dodge quickly!]

C-level puppets?!

"Wow--"

The crying of a child shook the heavens and the earth!

Before he could see who was grabbing his shoulder, Xia Ge's pupils suddenly shrank as he looked at the puppets a short distance away, wearing black clothes, with fang masks and wielding huge sickles, as well as the child who had fallen in front of them in a hurry.

Enchanted C-level puppets...

And that child!

--This is bad!
