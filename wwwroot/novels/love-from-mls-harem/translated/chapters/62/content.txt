As the night deepened and dreams drifted, they were no longer the distressing nightmares.

Gradually, everything in the dream became clear. She seemed to be standing in front of an ancient city that was so far away it was impossible to recall. The city stood on the clouds, ethereal and indistinct. Gu Peijiu looked up hazily and saw the towering female walls that extended to the sky. Above the massive city gate hung a huge, dark plaque with complex golden patterns.

On the plaque, golden characters of dragons and phoenixes were engraved, shining brightly in the brilliant sunlight -

Cloud City.

"Hey, what are you staring at? Come up here!" A clear voice rang out with a hint of laughter. "I've worked so hard, and you're still standing there foolishly."

Gu Peijiu turned towards the voice and saw a girl sitting on the female wall with a wild grass in her mouth. She wore a simple linen dress and had her legs crossed on the edge of the wall. Her slender and snow-white calves were casually exposed, and her grass shoes were pulled up, revealing her round and smooth toenails in the sunshine.

Gu Peijiu's gaze slid from her feet up to her slender waist and limbs, and finally slowly moved upwards, wanting to see her face clearly. However, it was blurry, and only the wild grass jumped playfully, spat out by the girl. She pushed against the wall with her hands and jumped up lightly, landing where she had sat before. "Oh well, I have to bring you up here. It's so troublesome. But I forgive you."

After speaking, the girl suddenly disappeared, and Gu Peijiu's pupils shrank slightly. She wanted to dodge, but suddenly realized that she couldn't move at all... as if attached to an immobile corpse.

She was easily pulled up by the collar, and in the blink of an eye, she was on the city wall.

Smoke and waves stretched out before her, and she was standing in the clouds.

This was an ancient city standing on an infinite cloud. Standing on the high city wall, Gu Peijiu saw the panoramic view of the city, with people coming and going, jostling each other, and there were vendors selling things, Taoist priests carrying yellow flags, and even some puppets and demons that were absolutely impossible to see!

...There were even puppets and demons?!

Gu Peijiu was slightly surprised.

She saw the stiff puppets slowly pick up a sweet potato from the vendor's stand, and the wooden mouth opened and closed, seeming to be saying something. The vendor was a linen demon without a head, with empty limbs. The two seemed to be bargaining, and the demon's sleeve "clapped" the small table where the sweet potatoes were placed, seeming very anxious. The puppet, however, was slow and steady, and finally, stiffly took out two copper coins from its pocket and put them on the table, holding the sweet potato and walking away. Not far away, a seven or eight-year-old human boy waved to the puppet with a smile, and the puppet walked slowly over, stuffing the sweet potato into the boy's hand. The little boy smiled and bent his eyes, holding the sweet potato in one hand and being led by the puppet in the other, slowly merging into the crowd.

As the puppet left, the linen demon who sold the sweet potato did not seem to have lost anything. She waved her sleeve towards the puppet's back, and excitedly swept the two copper coins into the cloth bag next to her that was specially used for copper coins, looking very happy.

"So this is the legendary Cloud City." The girl who brought her up was still sitting on the wall, holding Gu Peijiu's hand. Her toes curled up slightly in her grass shoes, looking particularly white and cute. She tilted her head and said, "Actually, speaking of which, there is no difference from down there, but there is no war here, and people seem to be living happily."

Gu Peijiu was speechless.

"Someday..."

The girl murmured, "Peijiu, someday, I will make down there the same as Cloud City."
She's calling out her name...

Gu Peijiu couldn't see her face, but she felt her heart beating extremely fast, the kind of fast that happens when someone is calling out your name.

"How do you know my name?" she asked.

"Who are you?" the girl replied, turning her face towards her. After a moment of silence, she muttered, "Your eyes..."

She slowly let go of Gu Peijiu's hand and looked up at the vast and boundless clouds. Her black hair flew in the wind, and there was a hint of melancholy in her expression. "Sigh, you look just like my little brother. It's hard to watch."

Little brother?

Was this person talking about her own brother?

The girl seemed lost in thought and murmured to herself, "I wonder how Wu Yin is doing now..."

Wu Yin?

"Xia Wu Yin?" Gu Peijiu's heart skipped a beat as the familiar image of a young man flashed through her mind. The next moment, she found herself holding the girl's hand!

"Huh?" The girl was startled. "Holy shit, you moved?! You can move?! Fuck yeah!"

Gu Peijiu was still trying to figure out what was happening when she heard the girl's excited voice. The sadness in her eyes disappeared, replaced by joy. "You moved! Xiao Kui said that if you move, it's 99% successful! Wow, I really like you, Peijiu! You're amazing! Hahaha, from now on, I'm one of your people, too!"

Before Gu Peijiu could react, the girl took her hand and leaped towards the clouds. The wind was fierce, and the girl's hand was slightly cold, but she couldn't hide her pride and joy. "I'll tell you everything I know! I'll show you this world! It's so beautiful! From now on, you're my only leader! I'll give you everything I have, and I swear I'll never abandon you. You're amazing!"

"Hahaha..."

Above the endless clouds, the girl's laughter was crisp and wild. She and Gu Peijiu jumped off a hundred-foot-high city wall and into the endless wind. The people of Cloud City were alarmed and looked in their direction, and someone shouted a sharp warning:

"There are invaders!"

"Defeat the invaders!"

Then, countless mechanical dragons with dark wings, sharp horns on their heads, and bloated bellies flew up from the ground and rushed towards them!

"Your grandma is the invader!"
The girl laughed and pulled out a bone flute from her pocket, which shone with a jade light. Using the flute as a pen, she drew a floating array in the air and then played a wild tune. "Pei Jiu, I'm fragile, you have to protect me," she said.

The sound of the flute suddenly erupted!

Pei Jiu felt her body come alive, filled with terrifying power. As a mechanical dragon flew towards them, she instinctively held the girl in her arms and waved her sleeve.

"Boom!"

A powerful spiritual force suddenly exploded, and the mechanical dragon disintegrated into ashes. The world changed color, and the sound was deafening. Pei Jiu held the girl, even though she was being controlled, she didn't feel uncomfortable at all. She even subconsciously raised her hand to cover the girl's ears.

- The sound is so loud, it will hurt your ears.

That's what she thought, and that's what she did.

...Although she wasn't this person, her thoughts and actions suddenly became surprisingly consistent.

"Wow, you're amazing, Pei Jiu! You're really the leader of our gang! Let's go and attack the lord's house! Let's take over the cloud city!" the girl exclaimed.

"Okay."

The mechanical voice sounded instinctively obedient, but also had a hint of tenderness.

Pei Jiu was a little dazed for a moment.

She couldn't even tell if the "okay" was what she said or what this body said.

She didn't even know...who she was.

But she knew she wanted to say that word for the person in her arms.

She wanted to fight to the death for her, to be her shield, to be her army, and to do everything she could for her.

For this, she would have supreme glory.

This was her god, her faith!

Although her rational mind told her that this was wrong, that she was Pei Jiu, a disciple of Dan Feng, but now, it seemed natural.
"No, it's not right!"

-- Who is she?

Who is the one controlling her?

-- Who? Why, why is she...

For a moment, her head felt like it was about to explode!

Suddenly everything turned into a mirage, endless clouds and mist dissipated, and the girl in her arms looked up and smiled at her. Her blurry face instantly became clear!

She bent her pretty eyes and her voice was crisp and pleasant. "Don't cover my ears. Did you just say something?"

At the moment she saw the other person's face, Gu Peijiu suddenly widened her eyes, but the next second everything disappeared without a trace, as if it had never existed. She instinctively reached out, but found nothing.

Feeling empty in her heart, as if she had lost everything.

The feeling of the slightly cold hand of the girl holding her fingertips seemed to still linger.

But when she woke up, her hand was empty, and everything in the dream seemed to be just a fleeting illusion.

However, the clear face of the girl in the last moment was deeply engraved in her heart.

Gu Peijiu got out of bed, pulled open the curtains, and looked towards the faint light rising in the east.

"It's the hour of the rabbit."

She murmured, then felt a headache and pressed her temples. It took a while before it subsided.

The clear voice of the girl turned into smoke and clouds, only that face...

That face, that face--

It was Xia Wuyin's face!

= =

The next day was the day the results were announced. Xia Ge went back to sleep well, then got up in the morning to wash up. When she pushed the door, she glanced at the tightly closed little house next to her, rubbed her face, and a sad expression appeared.

"Ah..."
"No one can accompany me for a drink," Xia Ge said, feeling a bit melancholy.

The system ignored her.

The place where Dan Feng announced the results was still at the Dan competition venue where the competition was held. Xia Ge slowly walked towards the venue while buying a baked cake at the village entrance. Many disciples who were also there to check the results surrounded her. Some were young, only eight or nine years old, while others were in their twenties or thirties. All of them had worried expressions and hurried footsteps.

When she arrived, the Dan competition venue was already packed with people. The neatly arranged Dan furnaces had all been removed, leaving a large open space. At the northernmost part of the venue, a tall, bright red list was hung up, with clear and sharp characters written in ink: "Dan Feng has recorded it."

"Ah - I passed the exam! I passed! I'm 46th!"

"Congratulations, congratulations!"

"Why can't I find mine..."

"..."

People crowded around the list, and Xia Ge touched the scab on her stomach that had not yet healed. She looked at the people who were squeezing desperately in front of her and decided to wait a while before going to check the results for her own safety.

Some people were anxious to see the results, while others, like Xia Ge, planned to wait until the crowd thinned out. They chatted with each other behind the list.

"Ah, so many people participated in the competition this time. I'm afraid they have to check the quality of the fasting pill. I wonder if I can pass..."

This person hadn't checked yet.

"I just checked, I barely passed. I'm really lucky."

"Sigh, I dare not even look! Let's talk about something interesting." A young man with a gourd hanging from his waist looked nervous. "Do you know what happened? I heard that someone demolished the council hall of Sword Peak yesterday!"

"Cough, cough, cough..."

Hearing this, Xia Ge choked on a bite of her baked cake. She felt like the sky was falling and the earth was splitting. She grabbed her throat and tried to fight the cake, but the young man next to her saw her choking and quickly took off his water gourd and handed it to her. "Little brother, did you skip breakfast just to check the results? I did the same thing, but I'm too scared to go now! It's really..."
