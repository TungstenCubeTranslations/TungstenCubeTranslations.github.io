The night was deep, the forest was covered, and the sound of wind rustling through the leaves was mixed with the faint sound of cicadas. A young man dressed in coarse linen struggled to carry a bucket of water up the uneven mountain path. After walking for a while, he felt out of breath and decided to rest on the spot.

Suddenly, there was a faint rustling sound in the jungle, as if a wild beast was passing by. The young man looked around in confusion and saw a black shadow quickly passing through the dense forest. He became alert and hid in a clump of grass, watching in the direction of the shadow.

As the shadow floated by, the young man recognized the figure and realized that he was heading towards the forbidden area in the back mountain. The young man hesitated for a moment, then left his bucket behind and followed the shadow.

The young man's footsteps were light and slow, and the shadow seemed to be nervous and hurried. They both walked down the winding mountain path and arrived at the back mountain. The young man became anxious when he realized that the shadow was heading towards the forbidden area.

The young man recognized the shadow as Xia Wu Yin, a disciple of Dan Feng. However, he was not supposed to enter the forbidden area, as he was only an outer disciple. The young man was conflicted about whether to inform his fellow disciples, but decided to follow Xia Wu Yin instead.

As he followed Xia Wu Yin, the young man accidentally stepped on a twig, causing it to snap. Xia Wu Yin became nervous and his mask was partially removed by a tree branch, revealing his face to the young man who was hiding behind a tree.

The young man was shocked to see Xia Wu Yin and wondered why he was heading towards the forbidden area. However, he decided not to inform his fellow disciples and continued to follow him.

Suddenly, they heard a cold laugh.

"Oh, what is the little disciple of Dan Feng doing wandering around the back mountain?"

The young man's heart sank, but he tried to remain calm. He turned around and saw a blue-clad young man holding a long sword. The young man's lips were thin and his eyes were sharp.

"I lost my identity jade pendant on the mountain and was looking for it," the young man said with a lowered head. "I accidentally came to the back mountain and I am leaving now."

The blue-clad youth sneered, drew his sword, and said, "The forbidden area of the back mountain is not a place where you can come and go as you please. I'll teach you a lesson so that you'll understand what the two words 'forbidden area' mean!"

The young man shuddered, realizing that he was in trouble. He tried to explain that he was only looking for his jade pendant, but the blue-clad youth was not listening.

Just then, a young woman's voice interrupted them.

"Aze, how can you carry a bucket of water to the back mountain?"

The young man looked up and saw his senior sister. He was speechless and lowered his head, murmuring, "Senior sister."

The blue-clad youth's pupils shrank slightly, and he sneered, "Are all the disciples of Dan Feng gathering in the back mountain today? Aren't you afraid of being punished by the Sect Leader?"
 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

The young girl wore a soft white gown with delicate red maple leaves embroidered on the wide sleeves and hem. A red belt cinched her slender waist, and her long hair cascaded down her back, tied lazily with a red ribbon at the end. Her eyes were picturesque, with a slight curve at the corners and a hint of coldness in the depths of her black pupils.

"My fellow disciples of Dan Feng have made a mistake, and we will be the ones to punish them," she said calmly.

The mountain wind howled at night, rustling the girl's wide sleeves. She looked indifferent, but her eyes showed a hint of killing intent. "The back mountain is forbidden, but how could I not know that it has become the playground of your Jian Feng disciples? And you dare to act so arrogantly here!"

With a wave of her sleeve, a surge of momentum erupted, causing the disciple holding a sword to step back three steps. He widened his eyes in surprise. "You are Dan Feng's senior disciple, Gu Peijiu!"

"It is I," the girl replied in a flat tone.

"Hmph, what's so great about that," the disciple in blue snorted, clutching his chest as he stepped back. He knew he could not afford to provoke a senior disciple of Dan Feng.

Gu Peijiu turned to the young man in a hemp garment. "Ye Ze, do you know what you did wrong?"

The young man immediately knelt down and said hurriedly, "I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have wandered on the back mountain at midnight. Please punish me, Senior Sister!"

"Go back and copy the Dan Feng teachings three hundred times."

"Thank you, Senior Sister, for your guidance," Ye Ze blushed.

"The back mountain is not a good place. Come back with me," Gu Peijiu said, turning around with her sleeves fluttering in the moonlight.

Ye Ze followed nervously behind her, secretly glancing back. What was Xia Wuyin doing on the back mountain?

"What are you looking at?" Gu Peijiu's voice suddenly rang out, making Ye Ze panic as he quickly turned back. "Nothing, nothing, I..."

But the girl's eyebrows furrowed slightly, as if she had sensed something. "The wind...the demonic energy on the back mountain has intensified."

Suddenly, Gu Peijiu's pupils contracted. "Go back, there's something wrong on the back mountain!"

"Senior Sister!" Ye Ze cried out in alarm.

"Submit your copy of the Dan Feng teachings to me in three days," Gu Peijiu said before disappearing into the night.

"Senior Sister!!" Ye Ze's voice sounded like a wail, startling the crows in the dead of night.

Meanwhile, Xia Wuyin heard the commotion behind her and knew something was wrong. But she had to continue her mission, guided by the system to find the rare crystal wood on the back mountain.

Xia Wuyin, or Xia Ge, felt a complex mix of emotions. She didn't really want to do this kind of sneaky thing, but once she got used to it, she couldn't really stop.

It was addictive.

Following the system's guidance, Xia Wuyin pushed aside a tangle of weeds and saw a small irregularly shaped plant emitting a translucent glow under the moonlight. The plant had two clumps of grass leaves at the bottom, supporting the irregular piece of crystal wood.

 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

Xia Wuyin felt a surge of joy in her heart. She squatted down quietly and took out a small sickle used for cutting grass from her sleeve. She carefully cut the glass wood from the root.

[Ding! Obtained quest item: Glass Wood]

[Quest completed]

Xia Wuyin successfully obtained the glass wood. Just as she was about to breathe a sigh of relief, she turned her head and was startled. She almost fainted.

"Shi Shi Shi... Senior Sister?!"

The next second, she knew something was wrong. Wearing the attire of a black thief, if she wasn't caught as a spy in Lingxi Mountain, it would be strange!

However, Gu Peijiu just looked at her without saying a word, her expression inscrutable.

After shouting out, Xia Wuyin almost wanted to slap herself a hundred times. Damn, she was wearing a black mask, wasn't calling her Senior Sister a dead giveaway?! It was simply a shame for the thief world, so embarrassing!

"Well... we'll meet again if fate allows!"

Xia Wuyin hugged the glass wood and made a decisive leap onto a tree. She secretly activated the lightness skill provided by the system.

"Ghost Shadow Confusion!"

The system provided lightness skill, [Ghost Shadow Confusion].

In an instant, Xia Wuyin felt her body become lighter. She turned her head and saw her Senior Sister standing still like she was possessed. While feeling happy, she also had some doubts. What was wrong with Senior Sister?

According to Senior Sister's old-fashioned temperament, if she found out that Xia Wuyin dressed up like a thief and came to steal spirit wood, she would either catch her and beat her up or make her copy books hundreds of times as punishment. Now, why was she standing still like a wooden stake?

Under the effect of Ghost Shadow Confusion, Xia Wuyin's figure transformed into three or four, moving extremely fast, seemingly disappearing in the blink of an eye.

Whatever, it's better to leave first with the Thirty-Six Stratagems!

The night was deep.

Gu Peijiu, who was standing still, seemed to have just come back to her senses. She raised her head and lightly waved her sleeve.

A red silk suddenly flew out of her sleeve, the silk was like a whip, passing through the layers of branches in the white moonlight. It seemed weak and powerless, but it was fast, accurate, and ruthless, hitting the thigh of one of the three or four black shadows!

Gu Peijiu murmured, and a faint hint of demonic aura appeared in her black eyes. "Caught... you."

If it were Ye Ze here, he would have noticed that his Senior Sister's expression was a bit off.

A Senior Sister with an old-fashioned and proud temperament would not have such a terrible and dark look in her eyes!

Meanwhile, Xia Wuyin thought her right leg suddenly hurt. Then, it felt like something wrapped around it tightly, causing her to stumble. Her left foot slipped on a tree branch, and she fell off the tree in a sorry state, grabbing onto a thick branch with one hand and hanging halfway up the tree. Only when she lowered her head did she realize that her right leg was tightly bound by a red silk, extending from one end of her leg to the other... in the hands of her Senior Sister!

"What the f*ck...?"

Xia Wuyin was not a fool. She immediately took out her small sickle and tried to cut the red silk, but the silk seemed soft yet tough, impervious to fire and water, and as hard as steel.

Before she could even cut it a few times, the red silk suddenly tightened! Xia Wuyin was distracted by cutting the silk, and she was caught off guard. Her hand slipped off the branch, and she fell from the tall tree!

At this moment, Xia Wuyin's first reaction was to cover her face.

Her head could be broken, and blood could flow, but she couldn't afford to lose her face!!
