After arriving in Chang'an, Xia Wushuang did not immediately go to the Chu Palace.

She casually walked around the streets, with two deer following her, clattering along.

It was snowing in Chang'an.

The people on the streets all had a smile of contentment that only the wealthy possess, a feeling that was indescribable.

Those who go hungry every day are different from those who eat their fill.

The reason she came to Chang'an was not to understand the people's sentiments, nor was it because of some sentimental attachment to her hometown - it was mostly because of her inconvenient identity.

She was no longer worthy of being the beloved General Xia by the people.

The only reason she came here was to see Chu Shi one last time, as she had said before... to see with her own eyes the princess who would rule the world.

That was all.

She walked around twice and vaguely felt that something was not right.

She looked down the street.

In some inconspicuous corners or on the street, there were always a few men in blue clothes, casually strolling or squatting in a corner, keeping quiet.

These people had an indescribable air of banditry about them. Xia Wushuang observed them for a while and found that they had no necessary livelihood, nor did they have any intention of traveling for leisure. They just walked around or squatted or stood...

In general, they were very suspicious.

Xia Wushuang thought about it for a while, then someone she recognized walked towards her.

It was the group of men she had met before, who she had bought drinks for at the restaurant.

Xia Wushuang's eyes lit up slightly. Meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land was undoubtedly one of the most comforting things, no matter what world you were in. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many people crying tears of joy when they met their fellow countrymen on a train.

But she wasn't stupid. Although meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land was indeed comforting, Xia Wushuang immediately noticed their attire - it was the same style as the idle blue-clothed men.

Don't ask her how she knew, but people from different places always have their own unique feeling about them. Sometimes it's language, sometimes it's habits, sometimes it's actions.

For example, someone who goes out to buy things can always be recognized as a student, teacher, or some other kind of person.

Maybe occasionally they might be wrong, but if you look closely, you'll always find some clues that make their guesses almost certain.
Who are these people?

Xia Wushuang thought for a moment and decided not to strike up a conversation with them. Tomorrow was the grand ceremony for the ascension of the Chu King, and she needed to find a place to rest. She had too many things to do, and it was better to avoid unnecessary complications with anyone.

These people...probably won't cause any major trouble.

Snowflakes were falling all around.

Chang'an, the Chu Palace.

The painting was finally finished.

Chu Shi put down the brush in her hand and looked at the scroll in front of her, as if recalling a distant memory.

Peach blossoms were in full bloom, and a beautiful woman stood under a peach tree, holding a branch of peach blossoms. She turned her head and looked back, her eyes filled with a shallow smile.

A maid came over and whispered, "Your Majesty, tomorrow is the ascension ceremony...you should rest."

Chu Shi responded with a grunt and carefully rolled up the painting. She then asked, "Where is my outfit?"

The maid hesitated for a moment, but dared not disobey her command. She whispered, "I brought it for you."

Soon, a soft white silk robe embroidered with golden dragon patterns was presented to Chu Shi. The outfit was obviously still unfinished, and the maid considerately brought her needle and thread.

Chu Shi took the needle and thread and began embroidering by the dim candlelight.

-"Hey, Princess, look over there, someone is getting married."

-"What's so interesting about getting married?"

-"Hehe, the bride is getting on the sedan. Why isn't it beautiful? The bride is beautiful. By the way, the wedding dresses in our area are all white. It's rare to see red ones..."

-"Huh? In your area? White? White wedding dresses? How can a wedding dress be white?"

-"No...um, well, it's more traditional to have red, but there are also white ones...haha, anyway, I can't wear any of them."

-"..."

Chu Shi didn't know what she was thinking.

She just started preparing for it since then...
She wanted to embroider a white wedding dress for this person, or for herself.

Until one day...

Her hand trembled slightly, the needle shook, and it pricked her hand.

The maid beside her exclaimed, "Your Majesty!"

Chu Shi, who was lost in thought, came back to her senses and nervously looked at the dress, afraid that the bright red blood would stain the immaculate wedding dress.

The maid widened her eyes. She had clearly seen a drop of blood drip into the dress, but when she looked again...

The dress was still snowy white, with the golden dragon pattern vividly alive, and there was nothing there.

"Your Majesty, should I call the imperial physician?" The maid came back to her senses and asked nervously.

Chu Shi put her jade-like fingertips to her lips and whispered, "No need to make a fuss."

She cherished the wedding dress and caressed it gently. Her eyes were filled with tender affection and indescribable melancholy.

The next day...

The coronation ceremony of King Chu began.

In a spacious square in the Chu Palace, a group of ministers, soldiers, women, and other people of various statuses knelt down. The luxurious blood-red carpet extended from the main hall to the throne.

Xia Wu Shuang tied the deer outside the palace. "Be good and wait here," she said.

The two deer looked at her anxiously. The smaller one bit her clothes and wouldn't let her go.

"Aw, are you so reluctant?" Xia Wu Shuang smiled and patted their heads. "I'll be back soon, don't worry."

The smaller deer had to let go of her clothes and watched Xia Wu Shuang sneak into the palace.

From afar, she saw King Chu.

He wore a luxurious yellow robe with a fierce five-clawed golden dragon. Her princess walked step by step towards the throne, as if to conquer the Central Plains and dominate the world.

The imperial crown with flowing pearls swayed slightly, covering her dragon face. A little eunuch behind her held her hand and followed her every step of the way.
"... Has General Xia arrived?" She asked casually as she walked.

The young eunuch was nervous due to the grandeur of the situation, and he trembled slightly at the mention of "General Xia". He quickly responded, "The servant did not see him just now, but with so many officials present, he should have arrived."

Chu Shi's footsteps paused imperceptibly before she continued walking.

...So, he probably hasn't arrived.

The eunuch was her confidant, and if General Xia had arrived, he would have noticed it first and reported it. Therefore, the only reason he would say he hadn't seen him was that he really wasn't there.

Xia Wushuang was unaware of the little incident on Chu Shi's side. She watched from afar and felt a slight sense of relief in her heart.

She thought, at least...

At least her initial expectations had not changed.

However, just as Xia Wushuang was thinking this, a voice suddenly shouted, "The enthronement of King Chu is against the will of heaven - I refuse to accept it!"

For a moment, the officials were in an uproar!

Xia Wushuang also widened her eyes and looked towards the source of the sound. She saw a man with a large sword and two swordsmen dressed in blue, who seemed to have exceptional swordsmanship. They had broken through the palace guards and entered. No one could stop them.

No one had expected that someone would rebel on the day of King Chu's enthronement.

It was really a rebellion.

"We have surrounded the palace," the man said coldly. "Chu traitors, prepare to die!"

Xia Wushuang couldn't see Chu Shi's expression, but she could feel the tense atmosphere among the officials. She was speechless for a while. She had seen these people in Chang'an before, but she never thought they would come here to rebel!

"Who are you?" Chu Shi didn't speak, but the young eunuch by her side asked in a shrill voice. "State your name!"

"I am a citizen of the Great Zhou Dynasty!" The man in blue shouted, "This world should belong to the Great Zhou Dynasty!"

The officials began to whisper among themselves.

"It's actually a remnant of the former dynasty..."
"After the overthrow of the Great Zhou Dynasty, the imperial family was all sent overseas and never allowed to return..."

"Since the previous dynasty was so long ago, they should only be rebelling under the guise of a pretext--"

"..."

Xia Wushuang vaguely understood.

Before, when she was still a bandit at the Lingxi Peak, she had discussed history with Chu Shi. Chu Dynasty was only in its third generation, with the first king being the founding emperor who overthrew the incompetent Great Zhou Dynasty and worked hard to govern. However, he died too early, and the second king ascended the throne early and gradually became addicted to alcohol and women, and sold the country for personal gain when the border was invaded, almost ruining the entire dynasty... Fortunately, now Chu Shi has conquered lost territories through battles and become the undisputed third king of Chu.

And now, the rebels who have come to overthrow him are the descendants of the Zhou Dynasty, who were driven overseas by the founding emperor of the Chu Dynasty.

Xia Wushuang thought to herself.

Chu Wang waged wars and recovered lost territories, and now he has ascended the throne legitimately. This rebellion has no reason or justification, and she doesn't know if they are foolish or just plain stupid...

Just as she was thinking this, she heard the man loudly proclaim, "Chu Wang and Lingxi Xia Wushuang colluded to defy fate and violate the will of heaven, resurrecting the dead, seeking profit in war, and turning bones into dust after the war. They are treacherous and cunning. Now, the wrath of heaven has been provoked, and evil spirits have descended--this person cannot be the king! The Chu Dynasty must be destroyed!"

Chu Shi stood still, not moving at all, while Chu Huaiwang, who was kneeling below, was shocked by the words!

Chu Wang has not yet come to reward his achievements, and coupled with the fact that he had suppressed the news before, now that he suddenly hears this news-- the matter of the evil spirit tide is related to Xia Wushuang, and combined with the puppet incident, which was already taboo among the people, and now used by these rebels as a pretext for rebellion, it is really too appropriate!

Xia Wushuang's pupils suddenly shrank!

Her blood began to boil all over her body--

Is it because of her...?

Her figure was concealed by the tree shadows, her hand tightly gripping the thick tree trunk, and her slender fingertips almost sank into it. Her jet-black eyes were slowly covered with blood.

"..."

She stared at the man in green clothes.

Chu Shi's voice was calm, "Have you finished speaking?"

The man paused slightly, "The palace has already been surrounded by my men. Over the past few months, my subordinates have infiltrated Chang'an in batches. Now that you have no more puppet soldiers of Xia Wushuang, you are like a hawk with broken wings, and a tiger with blind eyes. With only a few thousand useless imperial guards, Princess Chu, you are a trapped turtle. Why don't you give up on the ambition of ruling the world? Hahaha--"

"Ha..."
The next moment.

The man's eyes widened, and he could no longer laugh.

Chu Shi, who was about to say something, also suddenly widened her eyes.

In a fluttering white dress, the blood-red amaryllis bloomed in the warmth of blood, and the girl's blood-red eyes were ruthless. Her ten fingers were like blades, and she sealed his throat with a claw!

The scorching blood splattered on Chu Shi's cheek, but she seemed unaware, murmuring, "Wushuang...?"

...You came?

Just like a long, long time ago, she was not the Chu King, nor was she like General Xia who commanded the puppet army.

She was the girl who smiled for her broken peach, and the princess who blushed at her soft words.

...Just like...that.

Xia Wushuang slowly turned around.
