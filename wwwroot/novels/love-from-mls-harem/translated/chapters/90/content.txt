Chu Yao didn't hesitate, she lifted her long sword and faced the attacker head-on, without dodging or evading.

In the next moment, a sharp arrow pierced through the head of a bat, carrying a pungent smell of blood and a fierce gust of wind, brushing past Chu Yao's ear, followed by a sharp scream behind her!

The force of the arrow was terrifying, directly penetrating the head of the person who tried to sneak attack.

The falling bat revealed the face of a young boy, with black hair flying and red hair fluttering. The bowstring in his hand still trembled after the arrow was released, and his eyes were calm and black. Chu Yao didn't look back at the person behind her, she just took a step forward, and her long sword swept across, killing a row of giant bats that were flying towards Xia Ge Fei.

In an instant, the broken bodies flew everywhere, blood splattering everywhere. Chu Yao protected the boy in her arms, and her blue clothes were stained with bloodstains. She whispered, "Good shot."

Xia Ge Fei murmured in her arms, "I think... I killed someone."

Feeling the slight tremble of the boy in her arms, Chu Yao whispered, "No, you didn't."

She stuffed the wild goose in her hand into Xia Ge Fei's hand and said, "You just shot a wild goose."

After a pause, she added, "We'll eat it tonight."

The attack of the giant bats with such a grand momentum obviously alarmed the Three Peaks. The disciples of the Three Peaks mobilized together, deployed their troops, and quickly quelled this vicious attack of the giant bats.

The disciples of the Sword Peak found a corpse with an arrow piercing through the forehead among the broken bodies of the bats.

It was a young man in his twenties, dressed in black and masked, with an arrow piercing directly through his forehead, killing him instantly. He was ruthless and didn't leave any room for survival.

"This is the arrow of Sword Peak... Have you found out who did it?" 

Chang Lan looked at the corpse and felt a headache in his temple.

A disciple next to him answered, "No."

Chang Lan rubbed his temple and decided to seek the opinion of the neighboring peaks, "What does our junior sister think?"

Gu Peijiu looked at the corpse below, her face expressionless, and after a while, she slightly turned her eyes to look outside the window and said, "I don't know."
Chang Lan: "Baili, brother?"

Baili Qing squatted down, turned over the person's hand underneath, and then infused some spiritual power. After a while, he said, "This is a tamer."

"He should have wanted to raise a large number of giant bats for his own use." Baili Qing pondered for a moment, slowly peeled off the mask of the person underneath, "But he couldn't supply enough spiritual energy to feed the giant bats, which led to the giant bats rebelling against their owner and driving him to Lingxi Mountain, where there is an abundance of spiritual energy."

After the mask was peeled off, that face was revealed. Even Chang Lan couldn't help but take a breath. Although Baili Qing was prepared early on, he couldn't help but feel a little shocked when he saw this appearance.

The black-clothed man's face was full of blue veins, his cheeks were withered, and he looked like a zombie that had been sucked dry, extremely terrifying.

Chang Lan pondered for a moment, "So, according to Brother Baili's opinion... it means that it has little to do with the demonic cult?"

Baili Qing shook his head and covered the person's face with a black cloth, "I can't guarantee that, but the demonic cult usually uses demonic puppets when they act..."

Chang Lan said, "It cannot be ruled out that this person was used by the demonic cult."

Baili Qing nodded, "It's possible."

Chang Lan sighed, "The most urgent matter is still to find the owner of this feather arrow as soon as possible and ask about the situation at that time, so that we can prescribe the right medicine."

Baili Qing said, "The demonic cult spy has not been found yet, and it cannot be ruled out that it was our own demonic cult spy who wanted to silence them."

Suddenly, Gu Peijiu said, "The situation at that time may have been for the disciple's own protection."

Chang Lan said, "Let's find the person first and then draw a conclusion."

In a remote cave on Jianfeng Mountain.

Xia Ge and Chu Yao crouched outside the cave, next to a jar of bamboo leaf liquor with two persimmons on top. The bow and arrow were hung on the cave wall, and there was a clear mountain stream not far away, trickling down.

Xia Ge set up a grill, "This is a good place."

Chu Yao sat quietly on the side, plucking feathers from a wild goose.

Xia Ge said, "Are you angry?"

Chu Yao finished plucking all the feathers from the goose, leaving it bald, and was about to go to the creek to wash it. Xia Ge said, "Wait."

Chu Yao turned around, Xia Ge rubbed his hands, and pointed to the side, "There are still two mountain chickens over there."
Two colorful crooked-necked pheasants lay on the side, their heads seemingly crushed by small stones, their flesh and blood blurred.

Chu Yao: "..."

She had been too focused on thinking and plucking feathers earlier that she didn't notice when the guy used stones to kill two more pheasants.

Chu Yao came back and wanted to retrieve the two birds to pluck their feathers together. Xia Ge said, "Give me one, I can do it too."

Chu Yao didn't argue, she gave it to her.

The two squatted by the stream, plucking the feathers together.

Xia Ge pinched the colorful tail feathers of the pheasant and said, "These feathers are really beautiful."

Seeing that Chu Yao didn't speak, just bowed her head and plucked the feathers, Xia Ge was helpless. She turned her eyes and quietly stretched out the feathers, scratching them on the fair face of the young girl.

"Hey." Chu Yao's cheek itched and she was caught off guard. "What are you doing?"

Xia Ge said, "Why aren't you talking?"

Chu Yao paused for a moment, "Tsk"ed, "You need to focus when doing things."

Xia Ge said, "Do you think I'm stupid? Not talking when angry and not talking when focused, I can't tell the difference."

She paused, "Why are you angry?"

Chu Yao plucked the last feather and casually took the messy pheasant that Xia Ge had plucked. She whispered, "It's none of your business."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge patted off the chicken feathers on her body and stood up. "I know why you're angry."

Chu Yao said, "I'm not angry."

Xia Ge looked at her, "Are you angry that I saved you?"

Chu Yao: "..."

After a long time, Chu Yao silently finished plucking the pheasant. Just when Xia Ge thought she wouldn't answer, she spoke.

"I'm not angry at you."
Chu Yao lifted her head, her light brown eyes carrying a depth that Xia Ge had never seen before.

"I even think that your arrow was very beautiful."

Chu Yao got up, cleaned the two mountain chickens and wild geese, walked back to the grill, lit a fire. The sky had already turned dark, and the bonfire slowly grew stronger. She put the chickens and geese on skewers, sprinkled some seasoning.

Xia Ge followed her and sat face to face with her.

Confused by her words, Xia Ge asked, "So, you..."

Chu Yao's light brown eyes reflected the jumping flames. After a while, she whispered, "I just feel that I shouldn't have let you... pick up the killing bow so early."

Chu Yao didn't say the rest of her words. She fell silent for a while and said, "I was just angry at myself."

At that time, this child was afraid. She could feel it. Even now, though everything seemed fine, she was still afraid.

Xia Ge picked up a persimmon and said, "You are so strange."

Chu Yao looked at her.

Xia Ge threw her a persimmon, and Chu Yao caught it with one hand.

Xia Ge said, "It was my choice after all. Why are you angry at yourself?"

Chu Yao looked at the persimmon in her hand and said, "At that time, you were afraid."

The night was warm, the flames flickered, and the smell of cumin mixed with the meat. Xia Ge took a bite of the persimmon and said, "There are so many things in this world that I am afraid of. I am afraid of ghosts, hunger, death, and..."

She counted on her fingers, "Ah, there are too many to count."

Chu Yao looked at her, and the light brown eyes reflected the flickering flames.

"But can we just not do things that we are afraid of in this world?"
"I'm not afraid."

She stared at the goose that had been licked by the flames, "At least, I won't regret doing it."

"And I...am happy." Xia Ge lifted her eyes to look at her, "I'm happy that you can trust me."

When she shot the arrow, Chu Yao didn't dodge or avoid it. Even though the arrow was pointed at her, she still stubbornly faced her in that direction.

It was like entrusting her life to her, trusting her.

"I trust you because my intuition has always been accurate," Chu Yao said, "I feel that there are things you won't do, and you definitely won't do them."

Xia Ge fell silent for a moment, "What do you think I won't do?"

Chu Yao fell into thought, "I'm not sure."

Xia Ge held her head, "Hey!"

"But what about what happened just now? We just ran away like that, is it really okay?" Xia Ge thought of the giant bat from earlier and felt a little lingering fear.

Chu Yao said, "It's okay, I'll just tell them that I shot the arrow when I go back."

Xia Ge: "..."

Chu Yao said, "This matter had nothing to do with you in the first place, so just consider it a thank you for the arrow earlier."

Although she said that, Xia Ge still felt a little embarrassed.

"Hey, why are we talking about this? Let's eat, I'm starving."

Xia Ge felt uncomfortable and wanted to change the subject. She stared at the goose and quietly reached out her hand, but Chu Yao quickly slapped it away, "It's not cooked yet, what's the rush?"

Xia Ge: "..."

Finally, when the meat was cooked, Chu Yao gave the goose to Xia Ge, but didn't eat any herself.

Xia Ge held the goose and took a bite.

The crispy outer layer gave way to soft and tender meat, accompanied by the fragrance of cumin and sauce. It was so delicious that Xia Ge almost bit her tongue, and tears streamed down her face in an instant.

How long had it been since she had eaten something so delicious?!
"Wow, this is so damn delicious!! I'm bowing down!

"What's wrong with you?" Chu Yao was surprised to see Xia Ge crying after taking a bite. "Is it not good?"

"No, no, it's not that it's not good, it's just too good! It's so delicious that I can't even speak!"

Xia Ge continued to cry, and Chu Yao was getting a headache. "Why are you crying? Is it good or not? I haven't... baked it in a long time."

"Don't make me cry, don't stop eating, I'll go pick some persimmons for you..."

Xia Ge waved her hand while eating, "No, no, no..."

"It's too delicious!! Chu-daren!"

Chu Yao: "..."

Xia Ge, while gnawing on a wild goose, said, "Chu-daren, you should try eating the mountain chicken, it's super delicious!"

"I specially made it for Chu-daren!"

Chu Yao: "...Don't call me Chu-daren."

"But everyone else calls you that."

Chu Yao took a bite of the persimmon and thought for a moment. "You can call me Senior Sister Chu."

Xia Ge readily agreed and quickly finished off the wild goose in her hand. Then she looked at the tender and crispy mountain chicken under the fire and her paws began to itch, "Senior Sister Chu, don't you eat mountain chicken?"

Chu Yao shook her head while holding the persimmon. "You can eat it all, I'm not hungry."

Xia Ge took one with each hand and pretended to be shy, "Oh, that's so embarrassing."

Chu Yao: "..."

The starry sky was bright, and the night was gentle.

Chu Yao felt happy seeing Xia Ge enjoying the food, but there were still some things that needed to be asked.

"Xia Wu Yin."
Xia Ge was gnawing on the last leg of a mountain chicken, the skin crispy and the meat soft, delicious to the extreme. "Hmm?"

Chu Yao slowly took out the black, jumbled wooden puppet fragments, which were vaguely recognizable as the original prototype. She looked at Xia Ge and spoke softly, "Do you recognize this?"

Xia Ge's hand holding the mountain chicken leg stiffened for a moment.

You can avoid the first day of the month, but not the fifteenth, so...did it finally come?
