Running away when unable to fight back is almost an instinctive law.

Knowing that she couldn't win, Xia Ge ran away.

The Green Jiao's response was also very simple - a furious roar, fierce flames carrying an unstoppable momentum, spraying towards Xia Ge!

The place that was slightly touched by the flames turned into vapor in the blink of an eye. The scorching heat of the flames didn't even leave any dust behind. Xia Ge ran fast and just as the flames were about to lick her, she dove into a stone cave. However, she thought too simply. The flames licked the cave and almost instantly, the stones that made up the cave turned into vapor in the raging flames. Some bats that couldn't dodge in time didn't even have a chance to scream before they disappeared in the flames.

Just as Xia Ge thought that she was also going to be consumed by the Jiao's flames, her hairband, which was tied around her hair, loosened slightly. In the next moment, the thin red ribbons intertwined and intertwined into a dense red wall, blocking all the flames!

As the scorching flames sprayed past, the blazing temperature turned everything into nothingness. After the flames passed, the surrounding area seemed to have been swept away by something, leaving a huge empty space several hundred meters in diameter towards Xia Ge's direction. The black soil was still emitting white smoke that was burned by the flames. Even though Xiangsi blocked the fierce flames, Xia Ge could still feel the almost deadly temperature.

Xiangsi blocked this attack and slowly returned to being a thin ribbon, then drifted to the ground.

Xia Ge wanted to pick it up, but at the moment her fingertips were about to touch it, Xiangsi lightly dodged away. She was slightly startled, and the burning sensation on her fingertips made Xia Ge understand why it had dodged.

It was too hot.

For a moment, she felt a little heartache.

She paused and looked up, facing the Green Jiao, which was as big as a bronze bell, with angry eyes. Although this flame spraying skill was very powerful, it seemed that it needed some time to brew.

System: "Do you want to fight it?"

Before Xia Ge could speak, the system said, "I don't think it's a good idea."

Xia Ge: "......"

Xia Ge glanced at Chu Yi, who was unconscious on her back, and then at the Green Jiao, which was tens of meters long and about to spray flames from above.

Actually, even without the system's reminder, she also felt that it was not a good idea.

System: "But there is still a way."

Xia Ge: "Huh?"

System: "The mall sells Jiao beads. Didn't you earn a lot of points by becoming an advanced alchemist and making pills before? I can give you a discount of two-fifths off the five thousand Jiao beads, selling them to you for one thousand. Is it fair?"

She had worked hard for several days and nights to make the Baihun Pill and only earned a little over a thousand points. Now she had to buy this Jiao bead in a blink of an eye?! Was the system trying to trick her?!

Xia Ge hadn't had time to reply when the angry Green Jiao had already recovered its health, opened its big mouth, and a fierce flame burst out towards Xia Ge in an instant!
After taking a break, Xiao Xiangsi jumped up again and turned into a dense red energy shield, blocking the blazing flames outside!

Xia Ge hid behind Xiao Xiangsi and endured the scorching heat: "What is Jiao Zhu used for?"

The system replied: "After eating it, you can understand the language of the dragon."

Xia Ge: "......"

Does she have to spend a thousand points to learn a language of animals? Is she crazy?

The system kindly said: "Communication is necessary whether it is between humans or animals. Only by being good at communication can misunderstandings be resolved."

"Your sister," Xia Ge thought.

The furious dragon, unable to kill the ant, shook its tail in anger. It felt that its dignity was being strongly challenged. With a roar of anger accompanied by the sound of rushing water, the entire cave made of stone structures began to vibrate violently, as if it was about to collapse!

The system patiently persuaded: "You see, you don't know what it's calling, right? Although I don't know either, if you understand it, we can communicate and get along. What can't be solved?"

"Do you know what you look like to me now?" Xia Ge asked.

"What?" The system asked.

"A snake oil salesman," Xia Ge replied.

"......"

Wherever the flames went, everything turned into nothingness. The small area protected by Xiao Xiangsi remained the same, while the other stone ground vaporized into deep pits under the thick flames. Not long after, the water in the stone pool flowed down with a rush. Xia Ge carried Chu Yi on her back and stepped on the ground that was about the size of a palm. The original stone cave had become a distant place hundreds of meters away, while the scorching green stone pool water burned her feet.

"Boom!"

The dragon stretched its body, its huge body was extremely hard, and it was surrounded by the pool water on all sides. For a moment, a feeling of being trapped arose.

"Buy Jiao Zhu, it's the only hope," the system suggested.

"......"

Xia Ge actually felt that there was nothing to talk about with a fierce dragon.

What can you talk about with an angry beast that has invaded your territory?

Do you talk about how good it tastes?
The mall has opened and the option for the Jiao Pearl is within reach.

[Jiao Pearl: The inner elixir of the Jiao Dragon. Possessing it grants the same intimidating power as a Jiao Dragon and the ability to speak Jiao language.]

Intimidating power like a Jiao Dragon?

A pressure?

Xia Ge felt that something was off, but when she thought about it, she couldn't find anything wrong with the system's words.

However, whenever the system wanted to trick her, it was always with this tone.

But now, it seemed like there was no other choice.

The flame dissipated, and Xiao Xiangsi fell to the ground. The Jiao Dragon seemed very irritable, and with a flick of its tail, it splashed a three-foot-high water curtain. It raised its head high and pounced towards Xia Ge!

Ignoring the scorching heat of Xiao Xiangsi, Xia Ge grabbed it and leaped up. Xiao Xiangsi stretched out, carrying her directly into the sky!

"Roar--"

The Jiao Dragon missed its target, and Xia Ge flew to the top of its head. She fiercely swung Xiao Xiangsi, and with her heart moving at will, Xiao Xiangsi suddenly stretched out. As a clone of the ancient clothing demon, the Heaven Punishing Silk, she had also experienced the baptism of tribulation, and could almost be called indestructible. With a turn, Xiao Xiangsi entangled the Jiao Dragon's horn! With a pull and a shrink, Xia Ge pulled Xiao Xiangsi and climbed onto the Jiao Dragon's head, grabbing its horn!

"Roar--"

How could this Jiao allow someone to ride on its head!

In an instant, it was extremely angry. It raised its head high and rushed towards the ceiling, where the stone pillars crisscrossed!

Xiao Xiangsi was entangled in the Jiao's horn, and also on Xia Ge's wrist. It suddenly stretched out, and Xia Ge let go of the Jiao's horn. Like sliding down a slide, she slid down the snake's neck. With a loud bang, the Jiao smashed the ceiling, and countless broken stones fell down with a clatter. Xiao Xiangsi rolled up into a ball, like an umbrella, covering the scattered stones that fell. Xia Ge held onto the slippery snake's neck tightly, but still slipped several times. Fortunately, Xiao Xiangsi didn't stretch out too long, otherwise she would have fallen completely.

As she was thinking of a solution, she suddenly heard the sound of iron chains.

She instinctively looked down and saw the glowing emerald stone pool. With the Jiao Dragon's sudden movement, she saw the indestructible black iron chains, corroded by seaweed due to their age, but still showing no signs of weakness. The sharp and thick steel needles pierced the Jiao Dragon's tail, and the needles were connected by criss-crossing iron chains, locking the entire green Jiao Dragon. Now, with the green Jiao's abnormal movements, green blood slowly oozed out from where the steel needle pierced.

Xia Ge suddenly understood why the water in the stone pool was a dark green color.

Perhaps a very long time ago, the water in this stone pool was indeed water.

But now...
It is the emerald blood of this dragon.

"Roar-"

The green dragon was in pain and roared even more angrily, but to no avail.

Who locked up a dragon like this?

The dragon went crazy and stared wide-eyed. Xia Ge was thrown around like a rollercoaster, seriously pondering this question.

System: "Didn't Mao Qing say that the Bai Meng acupoint is the residence of the Dream God? It must be the Dream God, after all, it is a god."

The system began to come up with bad ideas: "Hey, why don't you just buy a dragon bead? You can say that it can help unlock the lock. What a good deal."

Xia Ge was thrown around by the dragon, holding tightly onto Xiangsi and Chu Yi. Finally, she gritted her teeth and bought the dragon bead.

[Host points -1000, balance 108]

[Ding! Congratulations to the host for obtaining {Dragon Bead}]

The wind swirled and a small, emerald bead appeared in front of Xia Ge. The movements of the green dragon suddenly stopped.

Without hesitation, Xia Ge swallowed the bead directly.

The bead was hard to swallow.

After Xia Ge finished eating, a warm force melted in her dantian. At the same time, with the force, a violent pressure overflowed!

This pressure suddenly spread out. The bats hiding in the corner were frightened and flew away, chirping as if they had encountered a terrible beast!

It was the pressure given to her by the dragon bead-

Xia Ge suddenly thought of a question.

This question had appeared, hitting all the previous inconsistencies. Xia Ge slightly widened her eyes.

[Dragon Bead: Dragon Inner Dan, possessing it means possessing the same intimidating power as a dragon, and learning dragon language.]

But-

The bats were scared away by her pressure.
So...

"...This dragon, has no pressure?!"

Yes, no pressure!

For a moment, Xia Ge had a sense of foreboding.

The power of the dragon pearl dissolved in his body, and an ancient and distant language slowly passed through his mind. The green dragon pearl, and the green dragon in front of him...

Xia Ge: "Xiao Kui, you..."

The system seemed a little guilty: "...The goods in the mall have never asked about their source."

Suddenly, the green dragon roared in anger!

"You thief! How dare you appear before me after stealing my inner core!"

Xia Ge: "???!!!" I bought it!!

The next moment, the green dragon, in its anger, disregarded everything and blew a mouthful of flames towards its own neck!

"I am not a thief!!"

Xia Ge let go of Chu Yi decisively, and with the help of his ghostly shadow technique, the two of them fell off the dragon's neck and barely avoided the scorching flames. With a "plop" sound, they fell heavily into a stone pond.

"Roar-"

The flames were terrifying, and even the dragon itself couldn't bear it. The neck was a relatively weak spot with fewer scales, and the originally emerald green scales were now blackened by the flames. The green dragon panted heavily, staring at Xia Ge in the water, seeming to have lost its reason due to anger.

But this way of harming the enemy without benefitting oneself, Xia Ge had to admit that it was the first time he had seen it.

But before that...

"Xiao Kui, you have to explain this to me."

The system: "..."

Xia Ge choked on his saliva and sneered: "This is the first time I've heard that there are such magical sources for things in the mall."

The system: "I'll tell you now, actually this dragon core has been stored for hundreds of years, and if we don't sell it now, it will expire..."
"Oh, so that's why it's only discounted by 50%?"

"That's not the point!!"

Xia Ge felt suffocated: "Do you have to trick me into this now?!"

The system replied: "But you don't usually fall for it."

Xia Ge: "..."

The system chuckled: "Haha, I didn't know that the dragon pearl was exactly on this dragon's body..."

What a trash system!!!
