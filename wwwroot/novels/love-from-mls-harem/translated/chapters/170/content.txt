Xia Ge frowned, "This won't work."

The system looked exasperated, "Do you think it's like fixing a torn piece of paper with glue?"

Xia Ge replied, "I only know how to do it this way."

Suddenly, the system became excited, "What you need now is talisman paste. Two hundred points and it never fails. Even if it's shattered into pieces, it can still be pieced back together!"

Xia Ge said, "Being able to piece something back together is the work of hands, not glue."

The system replied, "Absolutely, one hundred percent, it will restore the effect of the talisman! Just one bottle! Only one bottle!"

Xia Ge sighed and decided to buy a bottle of talisman paste. The system was not too bad after all, and the price was reasonable at five hundred points.

However, sometimes things don't turn out as well as we hope. In order to fill the gap, Xia Ge sold the red-clothed puppet to the system store.

It sold for one point.

It was indeed a point, as promised.

Xia Ge thought to herself, "Every time I think the system is trying to trick me, I shouldn't doubt it. The system is definitely trying to trick me."

However, in urgent situations, Xia Ge decided to save her breath and not waste time complaining. After all, she had dealt with the puppet for a while now. Looking at the useless quick-acting heart-saving pill, she could only trust the system's words half-heartedly.

Xia Ge used the glue to fix the talisman. However, when she put it back up, there was still no response.

The system said, "Um..."

Xia Ge said, "..."

The system said, "The formation seems to have broken. You know about that, right? See if you can fix it. Maybe the formation is more severely damaged than the talisman, haha."
Xia Ge looked at the unresponsive red talisman expressionlessly for the umpteenth time, and began to hope that one day she could press this worthless thing's head under the earth's crust and let it experience the magma-like anger. If it had a head, that is.

There was no choice, Xia Ge checked the ancient gathering spirit array on the ground as instructed. She had obtained three formations from the Lianxi ancestor's tomb, and the ancient gathering spirit array on the ground was no different from the one she had learned from the tomb. It seemed that everything was indeed the work of the Lianxi ancestor.

The gathering spirit array was not broken and was still operating, with the condensed spiritual energy gathered in the middle of the stone table. But...

Xia Ge looked at the golden formation engraved on the circular table.

She recognized this formation.

And this formation was the third formation that she had never been able to comprehend in the ancestor's tomb.

The reason why it was difficult to comprehend was firstly because she did not know what this formation was used for. Secondly, it was strange. Although it was a static formation, if you looked closely, you would find that it was different from what you saw a second ago. However, often before you could observe where the difference was, it had already changed again.

Xia Ge had studied it before, but because there were countless changes, she had never found the same moment of change.

It was elusive and ever-changing.

Now it was engraved on the stone table, and every thin line emitted a rich golden light of spiritual energy. That was the thick liquid spiritual energy that the ancient gathering spirit array had condensed for it. If the talisman was not broken, Xia Ge guessed that the spiritual energy would flow into the talisman under the transformation of the formation and suppress the evil spirits in this area.

But whether it was or not, she was not sure. After all, because there was no record of this formation, she did not know what it was used for and had never used it. So Xia Ge was still uncertain and could not tell if the formation was broken, and if it was, where it was broken.

Xia Ge thought for a while, looked at the golden spiritual liquid still flowing in the formation, and placed her hand on it.

In an instant, Xia Ge's pupils slightly dilated, and the whole world in front of her changed-

The golden light was brilliant, and spiritual energy overflowed. This was a new world.

After the golden light flickered, as far as her eyes could see, it was a pure and flawless pale color. Soft feathers floated, and white birds sang tenderly. Xia Ge felt like she was wrapped in a soft and comfortable world, as comfortable as a newborn baby.

This world was quiet and gentle, as if countless people were chanting, soothing restlessness and fear, as if all shattered and dirty desires could be washed away in this world, like returning to the pure and flawless time of infancy, without desire or sin, like a quiet paradise.

Panic and anxiety, fear and unease, all disappeared.

Xia Ge's hand was pressed on it, and she couldn't recover for a long time. She was immersed in that peaceful world, her brain was blank, and all love and desire began to fade away, as if she was about to leave the world and had no desires or wants.
【Warning! Host's mental fluctuation is abnormal!】

【Forced modulation!】

Xia Ge's hand was forcefully bounced off the formation!

She took two steps back, took a breath, her scattered pupils slowly focused, cold sweat broke out on her forehead, and her lips turned pale.

"I...," she touched her heart and moved her lips, "there..."

"...world." She murmured, "It's actually..."

The system didn't understand: "What happened? Did you see something?"

The system only knew that her mental fluctuation was abnormal, but had no idea what happened.

Because inside, it was a world that only souls could enter - a world that resembled the underworld, or heaven, or reincarnation.

Xia Ge knew why she couldn't understand the last formation.

Perhaps no formation master in the Fengyue Continent could understand it.

After all, it was an amazing talent to create a "heavenly world" exclusively for the soul using a formation map. Perhaps only Lingxi Ancestor had been able to do so in the past thousand years.

Therefore, what truly sealed the evil spirits was not the Wuyi Ling Mountain, but this unparalleled formation created by Lingxi Ancestor.

Xia Ge picked up the red talisman. She had just felt that the world was open to the door of this world.

There were no appeased evil spirits inside, and they could directly run out of the open "door".

If she wasn't wrong.

Xia Ge looked at the talisman in her hand.

And this talisman was the door to seal the formation map.

Now, the door was broken, and the evil spirits had no one to stop them, pouring out from various parts of the mountain.
"There's nothing wrong," Xia Ge said confidently, "the formation is not broken."

The only thing that was broken was the torn door.

The system said, "But that's impossible. Generally, glue should work, unless there's something special about this talisman paper - like..."

Xia Ge's fingertips carefully touched the paper, feeling its uniqueness. "Is the special thing blood?"

The red on this red talisman was not ink, but... blood. But that was not surprising. Sometimes, blood was an important material for making talisman paper. Skilled talisman makers would not only use ink to make talismans, but occasionally, when they encountered special situations, they would use powerful animal blood to enhance the effect of the talisman.

The system's glue should be effective. Perhaps what it lacked was just a drop of blood. But...

The system agreed, "Hmm, it's very likely blood. Yes, maybe pouring some blood on it will do the trick."

Xia Ge said, "..."

Apart from her, who was a person who could bleed, there was no one else.

"Do you sell blood in your store?" Xia Ge asked the system.

"Yes, but to ensure it doesn't rot, it's usually frozen. Do you want some?" the system replied.

Xia Ge thought for a moment. Although talisman paper did not necessarily require fresh blood, frozen blood...

After struggling for a while, listening to the mournful wailing outside, Xia Ge sighed and decided to sacrifice herself.

"If I don't go to hell, who will?" Xia Ge carefully cut her finger with a sickle and squeezed out a drop of blood, dripping it onto the talisman paper.

The talisman paper did not react.

"Ouch, it hurts," Xia Ge pretended to be indifferent, staring at the talisman paper that showed no response. "And it seems to have no effect."

"Hang in there. It seems like the talisman has not been repaired. Let's see if we can think of other repair methods," the system said.

Xia Ge finished her act of indifference, suddenly realizing that she didn't know why she had acted that way.

It was like... she was used to it.

If her senior sister were here, she would not say "hang in there."
What would she do if it was her?

Xia Ge felt like she had been spoiled by someone.

Looking at her bleeding index finger, the bright red on her snow-white fingertips reminded her of the red on her senior sister's lips that day.

Xia Ge's heart skipped a beat, and her gaze drifted away.

What should she do... she missed her senior sister a little bit.

So, as expected, people cannot be spoiled. Once you get used to being spoiled, when you encounter something that doesn't meet your expectations, you will easily feel sad and wronged.

Xia Ge never felt wronged before.

At first, there were too many things that made her feel wronged, so she didn't care anymore. Later, after she met her senior sister, she never encountered anything that made her feel wronged again, so she forgot that feeling.

Xia Ge indulged in her own thoughts for a while, silently cleaned up the blood on her fingertips, and then bandaged it with a band-aid.

As expected, it's better not to easily like someone, after all, being together is easy to become greedy, and separation is too easy to miss.

While Xia Ge was lost in thought, on the other side, the blood on the talisman slowly dissolved and soaked into the golden dark lines covered by the red on the talisman.

The dark lines that were repaired with glue led the drop of blood, crazily absorbing the familiar soul power and spiritual energy in the blood until every inch of the dark lines was covered by the drop of blood.

The Town Soul Light lit up with a faint light and quietly flew out two thin cloud patterns, unnoticed by Xia Ge, and flew into the red talisman.

"If we can fix it now, maybe we can release fewer evil spirits," the system began to worry, trying to shift the blame for selling fake glue: "The longer we delay, the more people will wake up, and the more trouble it will be in the future."

After Xia Ge finished treating her wounds, she was helpless, and too lazy to argue with the system. "I understand the reason, but if I can't fix it, there's nothing I can do."

Just as she was about to think of other ways, she looked up and the drop of blood on the talisman disappeared.

"...Is the talisman's water absorption ability that good?" Xia Ge picked up the talisman to study it, but in the instant she was about to approach it!

"Shua--"

On the talisman, the golden dark lines covered by the red all lit up, flashing a dazzling golden light!

A small space suddenly had a strong wind, and the red talisman struggled to get rid of Xia Ge's fingertips. Xia Ge instinctively let go of the talisman, covering her eyes and taking a step back. The golden light emitted by the red talisman slowly formed more complex patterns on the talisman, resonating with the formation on the stone table, and then returned to its original position.

In the instant the red talisman returned to its position, a circle of golden light with a transparent barrier spread out from the circular table formation, like ripples on the surface of a calm lake, spreading in all directions!
"Ao--"

As the red talisman returned to its place, the evil spirits that had escaped from the stone table formation and were about to crawl out from underground were forcefully blocked by the barrier and then suppressed and forced back to their original positions.

After coming to her senses, Xia Ge was stunned, then ecstatic. "It's done! It actually worked!"

The system was also ecstatic. "I told you my glue was fine! Do you need more? I'll give you a discount!"

Xia Ge: "..."

Even with a discount, it can't hide your true nature as a scoundrel.

While she accidentally repaired the talisman, Xia Ge also added a barrier to the passageway. Although her half-baked skills couldn't compare to Lingxi's, with the help of the town soul, it was better than nothing.

However, Xia Ge also knew that fixing the talisman did not mean everything was over. The red talisman's return could only suppress half of the escaping evil spirits, and it was uncertain what would happen to those who had already escaped.

Unless their brains were addled, the released evil spirits would not be foolish enough to return on their own.

Just as Xia Ge took a few steps, she suddenly noticed that the sickle in her hand had changed again. Perhaps after she repaired the red talisman, the town soul was very happy and generously lent her power. Xia Ge flicked the black sickle with cloud patterns, slightly hooked her lips, and prepared to find her senior sister.

But after a few steps, she stopped, thinking about her responsibilities as the Danfeng sect leader. Even when the senior disciples were out on patrol, she had to abide by her duties. But somehow, she inexplicably appeared in this place...If her senior sister and so many disciples saw her, it would inevitably cause trouble.

Xia Ge hesitated for a moment, took out the fox mask from her ring, and put it on.

The system said, "If you have something to hide, why wear a mask?"

Xia Ge sighed, half-truthfully, "Alas, being too powerful is also a burden. Sometimes the burden is too heavy, and I'm afraid I can't bear it."

The system: "..." I have never seen such shamelessness.

Regardless of what the system thought, although the emergence of the evil spirits on the Mount of Evil Spirits was not good news, at least the red talisman's seal had been repaired. The only thing left was to kill the escaped ghosts, and with the town soul, their mortal enemy, in hand, it shouldn't be difficult.

Xia Ge wore the mask given by her senior sister and walked lightly.

"Let's go, kill some ghosts!"
Here, the time was cut to the moment when the Red Puppet tore the red talisman and released the evil spirits.

People who had no idea what they were about to face listened to the increasingly closer and more eerie cries of the Evil Spirit Mountain. Although they became more alert, most of them felt that Evil Spirit Mountain should have evil spirits, and it would be strange if there were none.

So they only increased their vigilance.

However, the high-level members of some sects who knew the truth had a serious expression when they heard the increasingly closer and more eerie sounds.

They all knew that Evil Spirit Mountain was not named because of its terrifying evil spirits, but because it was a holy land for sealing evil spirits.

But now... in this holy land where evil spirits would never come out, they heard the howling of evil spirits.

The mountains were surrounded by each other, forming a clearing between them. The grass was lush, and the creek was murmuring. The area was about several thousand meters in diameter, which was not large compared to the endless distance of the Evil Spirit Mountain basin, but it was more than enough to accommodate adventurers.

People passed through the beast-infested mountains and came to this clearing one after another.

But compared to the people at the beginning, obviously, there were fewer people.

The ferocity of the beasts in the mountains was enough to turn people with insufficient strength into a pile of bones and blood in their stomach.

"Is this... the basin of Evil Spirit Mountain?"

"How is that possible? This is just an empty place! The basin of Evil Spirit Mountain is still ahead. Even if it is, how could it be so small!"

"..."

People whispered to each other while walking forward cautiously.

The disciples led by Gu Peijiu knew that this was not the basin of Evil Spirit Mountain. Their joyful mood was suddenly chilled. Lu Qie pouted and complained, "If we keep going like this, where is the end? Senior Sister, why are we going to the basin? Is it also to grab that thing called the 'Clothing Demon'?"

When they came to Evil Spirit Mountain, they only said it was for training, but did not explain what they were going to do.

Gu Peijiu glanced at him and said, "It's for..."

She paused, and the cruel howl of the evil spirits interrupted her words!

"Ah-what is that thing!"

It was a remnant!
The figure disappeared almost too fast to be seen, tearing the unsuspecting person behind them in half!

The person didn't even have time to say a word to the person in front of them before their body was torn apart, blood spraying everywhere. The person they were just chatting with had a smile on their face, but when they turned around, they saw hell on earth.

A woman with messy hair covering her face, drenched in blood, held a bony hand clutching a still-beating heart while the other hand frantically dug into the flesh of her friend and stuffed it into her mouth. The heart thumped and throbbed, seemingly not yet recovered from the shock.

The "woman" obviously noticed their gaze and slowly lifted her face. Her skull face, missing an eye, had fangs stained with broken blood vessels. She grinned at them.

This was not a person, this was a ghost! A ghost!

"Ah-"

The person couldn't handle the shock and convulsed before fainting.

A cool breeze blew by.

The "woman's" smile froze as she swiftly moved away. The next moment, where she had been standing was shattered by a red silk. The silk was agile as a snake, flickering like lightning. The ghost's speed was not slow either. She seemed pleased when she saw the silk couldn't catch up to her, but the next moment-

Lu Qie was listening to Gu Peijiu talk when the situation suddenly happened. When the ghost flew over, Lu Qie thought it was a fellow daoist skilled in disguise.

The blood on the fellow daoist's mouth looked very realistic, but why did they have a heart in their hand that didn't look like an animal's...?

Wait, why did they have a heart in their hand!?

Lu Qie was still confused when she saw her senior sister's empty hand suddenly holding a familiar-looking sword. With a flick of her wrist, the cold blade drew a sharp arc in the air, making a "puchi" sound as it pierced through the "fellow daoist's" skull!

It was neither too high nor too low, as if the angle had been calculated precisely.

The heart fell from the "fellow daoist's" hand.

A soft "pat" sound was heard.

Ye Zewang looked at Wenqing, who had somehow ended up in Gu Peijiu's hand, and touched his empty sword sheath in confusion.

Completely... completely unaware of when it was taken away.

Gu Peijiu withdrew her sword, and the Tianzhu silk returned to her sleeve. The large sleeve fluttered, and Lu Qie couldn't tell if it was an illusion, but she thought she saw a hint of green on her senior sister's wrist.

The "fellow daoist" fell to the ground, their expression grimacing. Under Wenqing's sword, their body twitched before their soul slowly dissipated.

Silent and soundless.
The cold voice of the girl in the red maple dress finished the unfinished words from before, "I came here to make the evil spirits here forever be the evil spirits of Mount Evil Spirit."

Lu Qie stared at the completely cold heart on the grass, feeling a bit confused and nauseous. "Um...oh."

Gu Peiju approached Ye Ze with an indescribable expression and handed him the hilt of her sword in a flat voice, "Borrow your sword for a moment, sorry."

Ye Ze took the sword back, "Senior sister is too polite."

"It's a good sword." Gu Peiju paused and asked, "Does it have a name?"

Ye Ze hesitated and said, "It's called Wenqing."

Wenqing?

...Wenqing.

Gu Peiju's hand holding the sword hilt trembled slightly. The feeling of the hilt was still there. She originally wanted to ask something else, but a scream suddenly interrupted her words!

"Ah-!"

Countless figures rushed over, willing to pay any price for fresh flesh and an empty heart, the evil spirits could do anything!

"Ghost ahhh-"

"Help!"

In just an instant, this flat ground turned into a terrifying battleground.

All of this showed that the evil spirit killed by Gu Peiju was not the end.

It was just the beginning.

The people who came to Mount Evil Spirit to scavenge were numerous, and even after that cruel wave of beasts, there were still many people left, and the terrifying battleground was filled with flying flesh and blood. The evil spirits approaching the team were basically taken care of by Gu Peiju, while Ye Ze and the other disciples of the sword peak helped from the side.

As a rising star among the potential candidates for the next generation of the sword peak, Ye Ze's strength was also considered one of the best, but he always fell a little short compared to Gu Peiju.

Gu Peiju was focused on dealing with the extremely fast evil spirits nearby. The Heavenly Punishing Thread in her hand was sharp as a knife and as fast as lightning, like a sturdy barrier. Occasionally, she let a few evil spirits with the strength of her disciples go in to practice, and immediately killed them when there was any abnormality.

She was truly at ease.

"Chirp-"
Tianzhu Ling pierced through the skull of an evil ghost, and the green hairband on her wrist fluttered slightly with her movements, bringing a familiar feeling into her heart.

That faint... breath.

Longing?!

Gu Peiju's movements paused slightly, and a fierce bull ghost with a terrifying face and blood all over its face suddenly rushed out from her side. Taking advantage of her momentary distraction, it clawed towards Gu Peiju!

"Clang!"

Wenqing's blade with mysterious patterns blocked the attack, and Ye Zedao exclaimed, "Senior Sister!"

Gu Peiju snapped out of her thoughts, but her heart was in chaos.

It was... the breath of longing, there was no mistake, it was longing...

The bright smile of a young girl appeared in her mind.

No, something's not right, there's no reason for her to be here...

There were evil ghosts fighting all around, and Gu Peiju threw aside Tianzhu Ling and leapt into the air!

Some evil ghosts also rushed into the blue sky, but she mercilessly knocked them down.

With just one glance.

With just one glance, Gu Peiju saw that familiar figure in the sea of black.

That person had a pair of familiar cat-like eyes, wearing a black cloak and carrying a sickle. Black hair hung down, and a red hairband tied the soft hair ends, emitting a familiar aura.

She looked pale and seemed very panicked. And this kind of person who looked weak at first glance was the best target for evil ghosts to attack. Sure enough, an evil ghost with a fierce face and a missing leg clawed towards her!

Although she looked scared, she reacted quickly. She drew her sickle with her bare hand, and the jet-black sickle cut through the cold black arc in the air. Then, at the moment it touched the evil ghost...

The evil ghost with a missing leg disappeared, and the sickle swung through the air.

When it reappeared, the evil ghost had firmly caught the slender neck of the girl.

The girl's face turned red, and the sickle in her hand fell weakly to the ground. She tightly grasped the arm of the solidified evil ghost strangling her neck. However, a Danxiu who had not been practicing for long, even if she was a puppet master with innate divine power, could not compete with an evil ghost that had been practicing for hundreds of years and had solidified its form!

At the moment when the girl was being strangled, all the discomfort and doubts, all the suspicions and unease, disappeared completely. Regardless of whether it was true or not, in Gu Peiju's eyes, there was only the person who was about to suffocate.
She couldn't bear any possibility.

She could accept being rejected by this person, and she could accept a future where this person may or may not have her, Gu Peiju, in it.

But there was one thing she couldn't accept.

Death.

She couldn't accept it.

In the moment when the evil spirit grabbed her neck.

Gu Peiju's mind went blank, and she didn't even know how to think. She only knew that she was heartbroken to the point of almost dying.

The child she had nurtured in the palm of her hand.

The person she had carefully protected and cherished, who was now being strangled by an evil spirit, was in a life-and-death situation.

"What are you still hesitating for?"

Whether it was real or fake didn't matter.

What mattered was that Gu Peiju couldn't bear the possibility of losing that person.

Unforgivable.

...Unforgivable!

He didn't know where his senior sister had gone, but he knew that he, who was powerless, was extremely weak among this group of strange and fast evil spirits. He trembled as he hid behind Ye Ze, tugging at his sleeve. "Hey, where did senior sister go... Hey big brother, be careful. You guys at Sword Peak are always fighting and killing, so powerful. I'm entrusting my life to you..."

Ye Ze, who had split open an evil spirit's head with his sword: "..."

Looking towards the direction where Gu Peiju flew, Lu Qie said, "Hey, why does that person look familiar? Like...the Sect Leader?"

Ye Ze was taken aback, and his long sword stopped for a moment. He looked up and saw "Xia Wuyin" in the distance, and his pupils slightly contracted!

"Chirp--"

Even though he felt uneasy in his heart, Ye Ze still split open an evil spirit that rushed towards him with one strike. He calmly said, "Let's go help."

Lu Qie: "Huh? Help? Help with what...Hey, don't leave me, I'm scared!"
The two of them walked towards the direction while killing ghosts.

When Hongcheng strangled the evil ghost with the broken leg, Gu Peijiu wondered if she felt any pain.

She was going crazy.

The Blood Sky Punishing Silk tightened, and in the next moment, the thick red silk burst open, disintegrated, and turned into thin red threads. The red threads carefully avoided the girl and then instantly wrapped the entire evil ghost!

The thin red threads were like the sharpest blade in the world, but they didn't rush to tear it apart. They slowly strangled the body, cutting it piece by piece. Even though it had sharp edges that could tear it apart directly, it chewed slowly until it turned into small pieces of flesh.

Even the soul could taste the pain of being shattered into pieces.

Shattered into pieces!

Gu Peijiu felt like she was going crazy.

No, she was already crazy.

She had never used this move before.

It was too vicious, too cruel, and too painful. Even for demon puppets, she tried to make their deaths peaceful.

But in that instant, she lost her sanity.

When the evil ghost was wrapped by the Blood Sky Punishing Silk, it loosened its restraint on the girl and screamed wildly, struggling and jumping. However, the more it struggled, the deeper the red threads strangled it.

Cold and merciless.

Before the girl fell to the ground, she was hugged by a warm embrace.

Tightly, warmly, as if embracing a precious treasure that had been lost and regained. She could hear the sound of the person's heartbeat, pounding and nervous.

"It's okay..." When the person was fine, Gu Peijiu's panicked heart calmed down, but the fear from just now was unforgettable.

She realized it so clearly for the first time.

Apart from refusing, there was life and death in this world.

That's love.

The girl lowered her eyes, her cat eyes were cold and mocking, but her voice was incredibly soft. She pulled on Gu Peijiu's clothes corner, speaking softly and hesitantly, with a hint of panic and shyness, "Senior sister... I'm scared."
"I'm sorry...I...I came to find you." She spoke cautiously, "There's something I really want to tell you, but you never come back."

Gu Peijiu remained silent.

The girl's left hand wrapped around her neck, her right hand hidden by her wide sleeve. She lowered her head and whispered softly in Gu Peijiu's ear, "Senior sister, I..."

As she lowered her head, the black strands of lovesickness at the end of her hair fluttered in the wind.

It was the same breath.

But it wasn't lovesickness!

Gu Peijiu's pupils suddenly contracted, and she quickly stepped back!

At the same time, the girl's voice turned icy, "I've wanted you dead for a long time."

However, as the arm around her neck tightened, the girl's sudden movement caused the dagger in her right hand to skew, stabbing directly into the left side of her chest, an inch below her heart!

A moment of intense pain! It was as if the knife had pierced her soul.

Gu Peijiu's face turned pale, but her lips curved slightly.

She murmured softly, as if she had let out a sigh of relief, "It's okay..."

It's okay, it's okay that you're not her.

The black hair flowed in the wind, making Gu Peijiu's smile a little dazzling.

"It's okay? Aren't you in pain?" Su Chan wrapped her arm around her neck, her voice slightly seductive and lazy, like a venomous snake spitting out its tongue. She spoke viciously, "Does it hurt a lot?"

Gu Peijiu didn't look at her, just whispered, "You're not her, it's really good."

"Haha." Su Chan chuckled, "I didn't expect you to be so sentimental, but out of kindness..."

The pain spread from the wound in thin threads.

Gu Peijiu's pupils contracted slightly!
"For someone like you, a reincarnated soul with a disability, the Wángshēng Dagger is a deadly weapon," Su Chan said in a manner similar to Xia Ge. "Senior sister, instead of worrying about others, why not worry about yourself..."

Gu Peijiu was not quite sure what the Wángshēng Dagger was, but the dense and painful feeling was clear and penetrated her soul. Her entire body became stiff and she couldn't move at all.

"Oh, you even noticed that," Su Chan sneered and drew out the Wángshēng Dagger. Blood splattered out instantly, staining the white Danfeng silk robe with red.

Tian Zhuling rushed over, but the next moment, Su Chan's cold Wángshēng Dagger was pressed against Gu Peijiu's fair neck, and the sharp blade cut a thin blood mark on her snow-like skin.

The momentum of the bloody scene spread out, and the two ancient clothing demons were evenly matched. With Gu Peijiu in Su Chan's hands, it stopped moving.

- Blood Stained Spring and Autumn.

She stared at Su Chan for a while and said word by word, "...Demon Sect... Su Chan."

Her consciousness was about to blur.

A stalemate.

Su Chan chuckled lightly, "It's really hard for you to recognize me in your current state. You can't even stand up properly."

"Why?"

Even though her soul was in pain, Gu Peijiu remained calm. "As a disciple of the Lingxi Dan Peak, why would I trouble the leader of a demonic sect to take action?"

"But senior sister, you are underestimating yourself." Su Chan licked the dagger lightly, and the bright red blood stained her lips, making the pure color even more vivid. "But if I have to say, there is a reason. I just want to see what it looks like when someone who doesn't shed blood or tears, sheds blood and tears one day."

"..."

Blood dripped onto the ground, splashing into a gorgeous blood flower.

"Now, I see you bleeding," Su Chan's smile suddenly brightened, as if she was genuinely happy. She approached Gu Peijiu and asked softly, "What does it take for you to cry? What does it take for you to feel pain? Did you feel pain just now?"

The crowd not far away suddenly became lively, as if someone had appeared. The wailing of the evil spirits being slaughtered made this world seem like a purgatory on earth.

"Wow, so powerful!"

"..."
"Who is this person? Why have I never seen them before?" Lu Qie exclaimed, looking in awe at a distant girl carrying a sickle. The girl moved as fast as lightning, her sickle tracing patterns in the rolling white clouds. With a flick of her wrist, she effortlessly slaughtered her enemies. Lu Qie had to squint to catch a glimpse of the cloud-patterned sash swaying beneath her shadow.

She seemed to be looking for someone, drifting and killing ghosts along the way.

Ye Ze had no interest in looking at anyone else. "Go find Senior Sister quickly," he said.

Su Chan said, "It must be painful to see your loved one almost dying."

She leaned in close to Gu Peijiu's cheek and gently caressed it with her delicate hand. "It must also be painful to see her leaving you, right?"

"Goodbye, Achan," Su Chan said.

Her sharp dagger pressed against Su Chan's throat as she slightly tightened her grip and whispered, "Would you feel pain or shed tears if I killed you with this face?"

Gu Peijiu looked at the face of Su Chan and Xia Wuyin, which were exactly the same, but completely different.

That child had the kindest and most compassionate soul in the world, hidden beneath her carefree smile.

Although the faces were the same, they were completely different.

Gu Peijiu said firmly, "No."

Su Chan's eyes turned cold, but then she smiled again. "You really are a heartless person. If she heard that, wouldn't she be hurt?"

Although she was standing, the poison of the dying knife had numbed her senses. Her eyes... were slowly losing sight, and she could hardly hear what was being said.

The soul, which had been stimulated by the poison, felt weak.

But she had something to say.

She really wanted to say it.

Su Chan spoke softly, stroking Gu Peijiu's cheek. "That last strike should have killed you, but you were lucky enough to avoid it. However..."

"Senior Sister?!" Ye Ze saw Gu Peijiu standing motionless and the person beside her from afar.
Her neck was cold and the dagger was chilling, and there was... the person holding the dagger.

Ye Ze's footsteps stopped abruptly.

Besides Lu Qie, there were many people following Ye Ze, because Ye Ze was considered the second strongest force after Gu Peijiu.

"...Isn't that...?"

"What's going on?"

"That's... the Commanding Officer?"

Su Chan's peripheral vision caught sight of Ye Ze and the others, and the curve of her lips became even gentler. Slowly exerting force on the dagger in her hand, she finished saying what needed to be said, "But, you won't be that lucky."

"Is that Knife - the Commanding Officer killing Senior Sister?!" someone exclaimed.

"Why?!"

Ye Ze rushed over with his sword!

Su Chan tilted her head slightly and saw him, her eyebrows raised slightly.

This is... the orphan of the Ye family in Lonely City?

This is interesting.

Then with a "ya" sound, "Long time no see."

Ye Ze's sword-holding movement suddenly froze as he faced Xia Wuyin's smiling face. He suddenly felt that the sword in his hand was very heavy, very heavy.

"Why?!" Ye Ze clenched the sword tightly, his voice almost squeezed out of his teeth, "Xia Wuyin!! She's your... senior sister!!"

"You're not like this!!!"

...Interesting.

Someone who couldn't even recognize who was who, told her that she wasn't like this.

Su Chan laughed, a very casual laugh, and the dagger in her hand did not loosen. "Oh? Then what do you think, what kind of person am I?"

Ye Ze suddenly froze, at a loss for words.
... What kind of person is Xia Wuyin?

To this day, he suddenly realized that he actually didn't know what kind of person Xia Wuyin was.

Three years ago, it was like this, and three years later, it was even more so.

But... no matter what, in his memory, Xia Wuyin could never be ungrateful! He could never be like this!

"Oh~ you don't have to say it, I already know." Su Chan looked at Ye Ze, smiled, and her voice even sounded a bit sweet and soft. "I guess I'm a saint who disregards my own life and saves others in times of danger."

Ye Ze's body suddenly stiffened.

"Come on, the saint is doing something bad, hurry up and kill her so you can feel relieved." Su Chan said casually, "After all, when a bad person does a good thing, they will immediately become a Buddha, and when a good person does a bad thing, they can fall from grace and become a demon."

Ye Ze's face suddenly turned pale.

He thought of a long time ago, when this person had rushed into the Evil Ghost Camp alone, dragging a broken leg, trembling all over, holding his head, word by word.

"... Don't be willful, older brother."

As a result, three years ago, he was ungrateful.

Even though he had risen all the way up to the Sword Peak, he could not forget Xia Wuyin's incredible look in the end.

Does he understand Xia Wuyin? He also thought he understood him, so... he was so incredulous.

Ye Ze's heart was slightly painful.

... Who is nobler than whom?

No one is nobler than anyone else.

But, precisely because of this, he couldn't even lift his sword.

"Senior Brother Ye! Do it!! If Senior Sister dies - we'll all die here!"

"...Commander Xia... no, Xia Wuyin is ungrateful. Senior Sister has been so good to her, how could she do it!"

"Do it, Senior Brother!"

The sound of condemnation echoed in his ears.
Ye Ze tightened his grip on the sword. It was as if he had suddenly remembered something, or perhaps only this matter could give him the courage to move forward. He stared fixedly at "Xia Wuyin" and said, "I don't care about anything else. I only ask you...to admit that you slaughtered my entire Ye family."
