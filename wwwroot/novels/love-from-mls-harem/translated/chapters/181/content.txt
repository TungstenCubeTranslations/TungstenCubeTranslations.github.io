She may be a girl, but she couldn't possibly summon evil spirits.

He had seen with his own eyes how afraid Xia Wuyin was of ghosts.

After rescuing him from the evil spirits, Xia Wuyin didn't cry or shed a tear.

But every day and night, she would wake up from nightmares and then never fall asleep again, just holding onto strong liquor, not saying a word, trembling in a corner.

Quiet and still, but full of fear.

That was trembling from the depths of her soul.

He also slept lightly, and basically whenever Xia Wuyin woke up, he would wake up too, even though she woke up silently, but he could feel -

That lifeless and frightened gaze.

Then the two of them wouldn't speak, crouching in a corner, staying up all night until Xia Wuyin couldn't hold on any longer, and fell asleep hugging the liquor.

Xia Wuyin may be a puppeteer, or she may be a girl, but...

She absolutely couldn't stand on such a high place and summon so many evil spirits, watching the slaughter between humans and ghosts.

Ye Ze closed his eyes.

He was too excited at the time and asked what he wanted to ask directly, and he believed the answer deeply, because he hadn't seen her for so long, he really believed that person was Xia Wuyin.

But...

Xia Wuyin wouldn't summon evil spirits.

Absolutely not.

That person was too suspicious.

Was the answer he got true?

Ye Ze couldn't help but think of the girl standing on the mountaintop playing the flute.

So many things were intertwined with him, but in the end, it was only her, Xia Wuyin.

But...


There was a moment of confusion. The sword in his hand slipped and spun in mid-air before landing in the ground with a crisp sound. Ye Ze looked at Wenqing and chuckled at himself. What difference did it make? After all, he couldn't get an answer from the real Xia Wuyin.

He picked up Wenqing from the ground and looked around. One of the familiar faces was missing from the group of disciples practicing in the morning. It was Chang Nian. Ye Ze frowned slightly, but he didn't care much. Although he was a candidate for the position of the elder brother, he would not interfere with Chang Nian due to their strained relationship.

Ye Ze was about to continue practicing his sword when he saw Li Liu smile at him and gesture for him to come over. Li Liu then turned and walked away from the group of disciples. Ye Ze followed him, thinking that Li Liu had something to tell him. However, he lost sight of Li Liu on the way.

Ye Ze couldn't find him, and when he turned around, someone covered his mouth. He was suddenly immobilized, with his spiritual power completely sealed. The person who restrained him held his mouth tightly with one hand and choked his neck with the other, making his breath cold.

Ye Ze remained calm, and his mind flashed through hundreds of countermeasures in an instant. However, when he heard a voice, all those methods vanished.

It was Li Liu's voice.

"Xia Shaozhang is really kind-hearted," Li Liu said lightly.

Li Liu?
He called for himself to come over, was it to obey Xia Xiaozhang's orders?!

For a moment, Ye Ze's mind went blank, and there was nothing left.

"Other than killing the spy, there's nothing I want to know." The soft voice was like a small spring in the mountains, trickling down, pleasant yet bland.

No emotions could be heard.

Ye Ze's pupils slightly contracted. Was this voice... the mysterious alchemist who had stepped into the ground level on the Evil Spirit Mountain?!

At the same time, he keenly noticed that this person did not deny that she was Xia Wuyin.

His breathing became slightly more urgent. After calming down, the person behind him who had restrained him was unidentified. However, the other party had set up a soundproof barrier - Ye Ze knew this barrier. People outside could not hear the sound inside, but the person inside could hear even the slightest sound outside.

"What a joke." The girl's voice was shallow and cold, "In this world, there is nothing that I should know, only what I want to know."

"No." Li Liu looked at her, his pitch-black eyes suddenly heated up, "You just don't remember anything..."

"Oh? According to you, what should I remember?" Xia Ge sneered.

Li Liu looked at her, his voice soft, "Xia Wuyin, you should remember that you are Qin Shuang, the daughter of the former leader of the Demonic Cult, Qin Yue."

At these words, Ye Ze suddenly stiffened, feeling cold all over.

His mind was also chaotic and collapsing.

He was so cold that he couldn't even care about Li Liu's true identity.

Was it true?

No... Li Liu's identity was unknown. It was possible that he was talking nonsense and had even tied him up here.

Even so, Ye Ze still held a glimmer of hope.

Hope...

For example, the mysterious alchemist was not Xia Wuyin.
For example, Xia Wuyin is not Qin Shuang.

He has always had this suspicion.

Even just now, he was still doubting whether the "Xia Wuyin" who told him everything about Evil Spirit Mountain was fake. He then thought that since that Xia Wuyin was fake, everything she said must be fake too. Xia Wuyin is Xia Wuyin, and has nothing to do with Qin Yue.

No... no, this is just Li Liu's nonsense.

Ye Ze thought that Li Liu brought him here to hear this conversation for an unknown purpose, and he couldn't fall for it.

There must be something wrong... there must be.

As soon as these words were spoken, even Xia Ge was stunned in place.

When she came back to her senses, she sneered: "Huh? Do you think I would believe the words of someone with an unknown identity?"

After pausing for a moment, she added: "And, I am not Xia Wuyin either."

"You have a butterfly birthmark behind your shoulder," Li Liu said calmly. "Every priest of the Demon Cult has a butterfly birthmark on their shoulder."

Ye Ze felt his blood flowing backwards throughout his body.

...Regardless of whether this mysterious alchemist from Evil Spirit Mountain is Xia Wuyin or not.

But Xia Wuyin does have a butterfly birthmark on her shoulder, and that is a fact.

Because of this birthmark, he had once ridiculed Xia Wuyin for being effeminate.

But he never told her about it.

The past cannot be undone, but the fact remains.

When the truth was presented so clearly before him.

Ye Ze became numb instead.

Very few people would see what was behind their shoulders while taking a bath, and Xia Ge was very careful not to expose her body easily, so she didn't even know if there was a butterfly birthmark on her shoulder.

Xia Ge denied it firmly, "You are talking nonsense, I don't have it."

But whether she had it or not, Xia Ge would deny it.
"Let's just pretend you didn't hear that," Li Liu gave a faint smile and said, "But aren't you curious about your true identity?"

Xia Ge's face remained expressionless. "I'm not curious."

This body has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with Xia Ge.

"A long time ago, the former leader of the Demon Cult, Qin Yue, massacred the Tu Ye family to obtain the ancient garment's radiance," Li Liu's voice was calm, "Later, she was hunted down by various sects and clans, and even the ranking system issued a wanted order. Qin Yue was caught and imprisoned in the mountain dungeon, while the little priestess disappeared without a trace."

--I'm not curious.

However, the words that Ye Ze said to the impostor that day echoed in Xia Ge's mind like a sharp knife.

"The one who slaughtered my entire family... was it you... was it?!"

Xia Ge's hand on his neck tightened slightly, and her mind became chaotic for a moment, her face turning pale.

Li Liu's breathing became difficult, but there was a shallow smile on his lips. He looked at her with a hint of pity and tenderness in his eyes.

"You've lived for so long," he said, "If you don't even know who you are..."

"...Isn't that too pitiful?"

"Shut up!" Xia Ge's mind was in chaos, "You're talking nonsense!"

She knew who she was very clearly!

She didn't need anyone to remind her!

She had done nothing wrong, she only did what she was supposed to do. She did not ask the heavens or the earth, only her conscience. Even if she asked the heavens and the earth, she had nothing to be ashamed of!

"Forgetting doesn't mean it never happened," Li Liu looked at her, as if he was watching a person struggling in the abyss, "Blood-stained hands can never be washed clean."

"If everything in this world could be forgotten as if it never happened, that would be great," Li Liu said, "Then the murderers would be forgiven by the victims' children, and all the sins in the world would be blurred."

"Changing your name and identity won't make the righteous path accept you."
"As long as you are still you."

"Then, you are you."

- Forgetting doesn't mean it didn't happen.

She casually said she forgot.

What about Ye Ze's ten-year family feud?

Xia Ge's complexion turned pale for a moment.

Yes. That's right.

If this is true.

Then.

It's not Ye Ze's fault.

Perhaps Ye Ze just happened to notice something different.

Come to think of it... it was only after he met Qin Yue that they became hostile towards each other.

At that time, he had already noticed something, right?

Knowing nothing, understanding nothing.

It has always been her.

She borrowed this body... naturally, she should bear all of her burdens.

Xia Ge paused to calm herself down, "Don't talk nonsense, I am not Xia Wuyin, saying these things to me won't do any good."

She then laughed and looked at Li Liu, "The Demon Cult... Ha, Su Chan, did Su Chan go to such great lengths to make you come and tell me these things? He really cares, even willing to give up a Sword Peak pawn, I wonder if it's worth it."

Li Liu looked at her without denying it, instead he said openly, "The leader said it."

"The doors of the Thousand Souls Sect will always be open to you."

Xia Ge laughed in anger, "Oh? Should I kneel down and thank her? Didn't she also say she wants to see me in unbearable pain and better off dead?!"
"Alright, alright, you can go now. You tell her that she has achieved her goal, and I'm fucking dying now--" 

Li Liu shook his head and interrupted her with a gentle gaze. "The leader also said..."

"In this world, whatever you want," he continued, "she will bring it to you."

"Don't hit a smiling person," Xia Ge choked on her words when she heard this. She couldn't decide whether to be angry or not. 

Finally, she sneered, "Crazy person, tell her to stop with her bullshit. If she doesn't give me the antidote and the love potion for my senior sister, I won't let her off the hook."

Li Liu smiled slightly. "Why be so stubborn? You will come back."

"Don't make it sound like you're selling fake medicine at the door," Xia Ge put down her hand and turned to leave. "Go back? Where should I go?"

Without her senior sister, nowhere was home.

The system interjected, "What about the spy?"

"...That's their business in Lingxi Peak. It has nothing to do with me."

She took a few steps, paused, didn't turn back, and just coldly told Li Liu, "Don't let me see you again."

Her footsteps gradually faded away.

It seemed like everything was over.

Ye Ze felt like he was already very calm.

Numb, yet calm.

This mysterious alchemist with a mask was definitely Xia Wu Yin.

Definitely her.

It was just a gut feeling.

But what could she do? 

"...Everything that needed to be said has been said. Can you let go now?" Ye Ze's voice was hoarse, mixed with a hint of self-mockery. "Why did I need to hear all of that?"
"You should know the truth," the girl's voice carried a faint laugh.

Ye Ze suddenly raised his head, his pupils slightly shrinking!

The girl in front of him was wearing Li Liu's clothes, but her face was not the same.

Her soft black hair draped over her shoulders, the girl's eyes narrow and dark, her lips red and her skin as white as snow. Even the blue clothes of Jianfeng could not match her unparalleled beauty.
