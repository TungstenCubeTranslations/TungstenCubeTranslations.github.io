My name is Furiere Iyaziku. I was born as the second daughter of the Iyaziku family and now I am known as a young B-rank hunter. Although I am now famous, when I first said that I wanted to become a hunter, my parents strongly opposed it. Despite my professional talent, they could not agree to me going down a path where I could die at any moment.

Perhaps they were also worried that the Iyaziku family, which would be equivalent to nobility in other countries - I will omit the fact that I became a disciple of another noble daughter - would do something wrong. But there was also the value of being used as a noble child.

However, thanks to having an excellent older sister and a younger brother, who were both nobles, I was eventually accepted. The reason why I wanted to become a hunter is simple: I thought it was the closest way for a woman to obtain a certain position.

Hunters are a place where jobless lower-class people gather, but at the same time, it is a large organization that has influence in various countries. Although low-rank hunters are treated like trash, it is possible to receive treatment equal to that of nobles if you become a high-rank hunter.

Especially if you become A-rank or higher, you could say that you have more power than the Iyaziku family. I didn't want to end up as just a noble daughter, to put it bluntly.

If my profession wasn't an "advanced flame magic user," I might not have aimed for it, but as a result, the Iyaziku family has also accepted me favorably as a young B-rank hunter. My nickname, "The Scorching Beauty," suits me perfectly, and my hunter life seems to be going smoothly, but there is one thing I can't accept.

That is the existence of "The Ice Witch" Carol.

We became hunters at the same time and competed to raise our ranks, but I have never been able to beat her in ice magic. She always stays one step ahead. She became a B-rank hunter faster than me, and she even got promoted to A-rank. At least five more years. Normally, it should have taken 10 to 20 years, but I was left behind.

Her enthusiasm for ice magic is admirable. I can't study magic to that extent. Basically, I'm not good at details.

Instead, I have emphasized practice... and now, my disciple Viviana is approaching the point where she can reach me.

Even I, who has achieved results that should not require me to be in a hurry, feel anxious about the rapid growth of my peers. I can't accept being left behind by Carol in ice magic anymore.

At that time, Viviana told me about a child who was rapidly climbing the ranks of hunters. I realized that there are always people above you and that this child must be contributing to the advancement of our peers.
 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

And then I found her.
The girl with delicate features and white hair. I've always taken care of my appearance, but her skin is even more beautiful than mine. Despite the age difference, she would still come out on top if we were to compare ourselves at the same age.
The barrier protecting the girl with such an appearance, however, is anything but cute.

It covers her in three layers, forming a hemisphere. The outermost layer seems to have a defense strong enough to repel attacks from C-ranked monsters.
It's hard to tell, but it seems like the defense increases as you go further in.

If that's the case, I wonder how strong the innermost layer is?

And the barrier is so beautiful. The magic flows evenly without any fluctuations. To break through this barrier, you would need pure attack power that exceeds it.
Even ice would create fluctuations in the barrier, so being able to break through it requires a certain level of skill.

At least, the small fry I'm dealing with now is not someone I can handle. It's a good lesson not to judge strength based on appearance.
I don't know how much the price for that lesson will be, though.

But still, if I were shown a barrier like that, I wouldn't be able to keep quiet. However, if I were to pick a fight just because I'm curious about her strength, I would anger both the Hunter Association and the Yatsyk family.
So I came up with a good idea.

To do that, it's best to become acquaintances first. I should be able to start a conversation without being too cautious.

So, I'm sorry to that small fry over there, but I'll have them take over as the girl's opponent. They can learn from someone else.

"You're not someone who can handle an opponent like her. If you don't want to die, put your hands down now."

With just those words, they ran away. I wish they showed a bit more courage as a Hunter, but they know who I am, so it's natural. I've heard that most people don't want to mess with higher-ranked Hunters anyway.
I've always faced everything head-on.

"It's not like I needed your help."

After the man left, the blunt girl's voice could be heard. It's not that she was including me, but rather that she wasn't interested in anyone else.

"I know you're fine. From that barrier, I can tell you're a B-ranked Hunter.
You're the one who broke the record for the youngest to be promoted to B-rank, right? That's what Viviana said."

It's important to confirm. I learned that the hard way before. I think that's how I met that ice user, but just remembering it makes me shudder.
No, that's not important now. It's a waste of time to worry about someone like her.

"Are you related to Viviana?"
"I haven't introduced myself yet!
I am Freire Yatsyk. I'm a B-ranked Hunter with the nickname 'Scorching Beauty.'
As for my relationship with Viviana, she's my student!"

It's important to have someone remember your name. That doesn't change whether you're a Hunter or a noble.
After I introduced myself, the girl in front of me opened her mouth with a slightly annoyed expression.

"I'm Cielmer."
"Cielmer, is it? It doesn't matter about the small fry from earlier, but can I make a request of you?"
"What is it?"
"Would you be willing to have a mock battle with me?"

If I can't pick a fight, then I'll just make a request. As long as we pay each other and agree to it, there shouldn't be any problems.
I used a little trick to get her to accept, but it's within the acceptable range.
Cielmer stared at the empty air for a while before answering shortly, "What are the conditions?"
 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

"Thank you for accepting. First, let's talk about the reward. How about 50 gold coins regardless of the outcome?"

"That's too much for a B-rank request."

"I see. But I believe it's worth that much."

In the first place, there aren't many opportunities to have mock battles like this for B-rank or higher requests. If I can buy this opportunity with money, I won't hesitate. It's a rare chance to become stronger. And this time, it's the opponent that I feel will be the trigger for Viviana's growth...so it would be a waste to hold back.

"The way of the battle will be the one that hunters often use. No killing, and avoid causing serious injuries as much as possible. Admit defeat, incapacitate the opponent, or judge that a valid hit has been made to win. How about that?"

"Understood. Who will be the witness?"

"Celia, I'll leave it to you."

Celia, who is both an acquaintance and has a track record, is perfect for the witness. That's what I thought when I nominated her, but I heard an annoying voice from behind.

"Why did you come here, Ice?"

"I came to see that child. It's been a while, Cielmer."

"Carol, it's been a while."

It seems that these two are also acquaintances. And they seem to be quite comfortable with each other. The prediction that this girl, Cielmer, is involved in the advancement of her peers seems to be correct, and the presence of Ice is annoying.

"I'll talk to you later. First, I'll beat up that red one over there to feel refreshed."

"Are you trying to pick a fight? I'm not interested."

"Yes, yes. You're going to fight that child, right? It's a good opportunity, so you should lose completely. Don't come crying later!"

She's really annoying. I'll definitely make her apologize later.

"That's why, if you're going to hold a grudge, hold it against Ice over there."

Yes, yes. I'm sorry, but I can't hold back anymore. I wasn't planning on it from the beginning.

In preparation for the mock battle, they moved to a different location. Although there should have been a place for the Hunter's Association to conduct mock battles, for some reason they ended up outside the town. Cielmer led Ain to a vast grassland far from the town. Unlike in the town, they could go all out here.

It was a relief to not have to put on any limiters.

Ain and Cielmer stood facing each other, while Fii watched from a distance. It was incomprehensible why Fii was the arbiter, but it was not a bad choice considering that they would not die even if they were caught in the crossfire.

"Are you ready?" 
"Anytime."

Although Cielmer said so, they did not move while looking at Ain. Were they conceding the first move? Or were they aiming for a counter?

Either way, they were trying to provoke Ain to make the first move. However, Ain was not holding back today. Although it would take a little time, if Cielmer was willing to give them the first move, then Ain would go all out. Among the magic Ain used, there was a special one that only they had given a name to.

Burning the red flames, burning them, and reaching the blue-white world.

There were four of them, each slightly higher than Ain's shoulders, floating balls of blue-white flames. Even for a high-level fire magic user, it would take several seconds to prepare, and it was not something that could be used lightly. Those few seconds could often make or break the battle.

However, its power was unparalleled. It would surely turn the entire area into a scorched earth, but Ain would leave the extinguishing to Fii.

When they were ready, Cielmer was still looking at Ain without changing their expression. Ain would soon wipe that calm expression off their face. And maybe they could get a grunt out of Fii too.

"If you want to dodge, feel free." 
"..." 
"I guess there's nothing to talk about. Alright. Take this, 'Azure Purgatory'."

As the name of the magic was spoken, the ball of flames flew towards Cielmer, surrounding them. Cielmer did not appear to be trying to dodge, merely looking at the flames. Did they think it was just an ordinary flame? If so, they were in for a disappointment.

Despite its appearance, Azure Purgatory contained an enormous amount of magical power. No, it was precisely because it contained so much magical power that it could burn wyverns and worms to a crisp. The flames were so hot that even a half-hearted resistance would be meaningless.

The flames collided with Cielmer's barrier, burning it to ashes.

And in an instant, the fire spread. The grassland turned into a sea of flames in an instant. Ain was not affected by the flames, so they did not have to worry, but they did not like how Fii was protecting themselves so well. Would they get burned a little?

When they looked at their opponent, the barrier was still burning. How many barriers had Ain burned through now? No matter how many there were, there was no way Azure Purgatory could not burn them to ashes.

They believed that.

But in the next moment, Ain felt a chill.
 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

The remnants of the Blue Purgatory spread out, covering the flames that had spread, in a space of ice so vast it seemed to stretch on endlessly.

In the center of that icy space, the source of it all, Cielmer looked towards us as if nothing had happened.
