"The discussion from here on is that there seems to be no work like Fiiyanamia-sama or the Spirit King," said the speaker.
"So, we can continue living as usual?" replied the listener.
"That won't be possible anymore. Although there are already some gods mixed in, it seems that we will continue to get closer to the gods. Ultimately, it seems that we will become one of the gods," said the speaker.
"Ain will become a god?" asked Ciel, tilting their head.
It was unrealistic to suddenly be told that they would become a god, and honestly, it didn't matter to them.

"I don't really care about becoming a god, so let's put that aside for now. But as I continue to get closer to the gods, half of my magic power will be replaced by divine power, and I will step into the realm of the gods. It's said that it will take up to 10 years to get there," explained the speaker.
"What's the problem then?" asked the listener.
"As I get closer to the gods, you, Ciel, will also be pulled and become a god," said the speaker.

It was a once-in-a-lifetime gamble. They had managed to put it into words with that kind of determination, but Ciel still had a face that didn't seem to understand. They had been nervous to the point where their heart would burst if they had a body, but it seemed that the tension would continue for a while.

"What will happen to me when I get closer to the gods?" asked Ciel.
"Well, when you get closer to the gods, you'll be able to hear the voices of the spirits and interact with them," said the speaker.
"That sounds wonderful," replied Ciel.
"Then, when you step into the realm of the gods, you'll become immortal, and gradually you won't need to eat or sleep, and you'll become harder to kill," continued the speaker.
"The problem is that it's irreversible. Once you step into the realm of the gods, you can't go back to being human," said the speaker.

Even after saying all that, Ciel's expression remained serious and unchanged. They didn't think that Ciel didn't understand, but maybe it was difficult to grasp. So, what the speaker said next might be a little unfair.

"In order to prevent Ciel from becoming a god, I need to disappear..." said the speaker.
"There's no need to think about that. Ain won't disappear," interrupted Ciel.
Their resolute voice made it clear that they were strong.

Honestly, the speaker was relieved. They had been prepared to accept disappearing, but it was still lonely to part ways with Ciel. However, they couldn't be too relieved here. After all, it wasn't something that could be decided on a whim.

"Please think carefully about it. You'll no longer be human, you know?" said the speaker.
The important decision needed to be made more carefully. That's what the speaker thought when they asked, and Ciel's cheeks puffed up.
They were pouting, and their mouth was twisted. In other words, they seemed to have been angered.

"Ain, are you really thinking about it? Didn't I tell you? If you disappear, I'll look for you forever. I'll look for you until I die. You don't think I'm lying, do you?" said Ciel.
"I don't think so, but it might be too late to want to be human again," replied the speaker.
"That's the same even if you become a god. Ain will still be there, and the spirits will still be there, and Fii will still be there, right? I have everything I need. Do you understand?" said Ciel.

The speaker nodded, overwhelmed by Ciel's commanding tone. They had probably been scolded by Ciel before. It felt like the first time they had shouted at someone was yesterday, but it was completely different. If there were people around, they would be amazed at who the adult was.

Feeling disheartened because they had no dignity, the speaker was asked by Ciel in a quiet voice, "Hey, Ainseru. Do you hate me?"
"No, I love you. If I didn't, I wouldn't have been with you all this time," replied the speaker.
"I love you too, Ain. So, no matter what happens, I'll choose you. Is that okay?" said Ciel.
"Yes...yes," replied the speaker.
 ---- ◇ ---- 

Ciel's words are very pleasing. They make me happy, but for some reason, they also bother me.

Fiiyanamia-sama said that she would be happy to stay together forever. Surely Ciel is seriously considering becoming a god. He has no attachment to being human.

Then why am I bothered? What am I anxious about?

Why did I think I had to part with Ciel?

For Ciel to become independent?

- No.

For him to grow up and leave his parents?

- No.

Ah, I see. It's because I thought that if he didn't become independent and leave me, he wouldn't be happy. That's right. I'm anxious because I'm not sure if I can make Ciel happy.

If I had died a little younger, I could have confidently said that I would make Ciel happy no matter what difficulties we faced. As a high school student, I think I could have bragged about it with baseless confidence. Because I couldn't see reality.

But I don't think I'm a great adult, and I'm not so childish that I don't understand the difficulty of carrying someone else's life.

And if he becomes a god, it won't be over so easily. A life of only a few decades is different from a life of weight.

"What's bothering you?"
"I...I don't want to be separated from Ciel. But I don't have the confidence to keep making him happy. I'm worried that if I keep him with me, I'll make him unhappy."

Oh no, I've let out a weak voice to Ciel. But I felt like I had to say it. I can't irresponsibly say, "I'll definitely make you happy." Even if I could say it, "I'll keep protecting you in the future" is the best I can do.

Ciel tilts his head at my words and thinks about something.

"Hey, Ain. I like you, Ain. I like it when you smile, when you sing, and when you're having fun. But you know, I also like it when you're embarrassed and when you get angry for me."
"I see...what do you mean?"
"But, you know, I don't want to see Ain really struggling or sad. Um, it's nice that Ain wants to make me happy, and that alone makes me happy, but I think it's impossible for Ain to make me happy."
"What do you mean?"

Ciel talks hard, but he's cute, and I can't quite understand him.

"You and I are different. Even if Ain is struggling, I'm happy to see Ain struggling. Did you know that until now, Ain?"
"And I don't know what makes me happy either. Maybe if I see a side of you that you don't know, I'll be happy or sad. And I don't even know how to be happy myself.
So, you know, I think I feel happy on my own. Maybe Ain is also feeling happy on his own?
Still, I don't know how to be happy, but I know that Ain is necessary for me to be happy.

What about Ain? Does Ain need me to be happy?"

Certainly, I didn't know that Ciel was happy to see me struggling. It's kind of embarrassing.

But do I need Ciel to be happy...?

If it were before I met Ciel, I couldn't answer that question, but now that I've met him, I can't imagine happiness without him. Rather, since coming to this world, I've been clinging to Ciel, and that's why I've been able to survive.
 ---- ◇ ---- 

"I need... to do it."

"If that's the case, then it's okay. Ain, you don't need to make me happy. From now on, let's each be happy in our own way, but together."

Ciel laughs, like a flower blooming, like the sun shining. It feels a bit like a proposal, and I can't help but laugh too. Oh, but I see. Ciel and my relationship is not about independence, or separating from our parents. It's not about that anymore.

I will continue to protect Ciel and do what I can to make Ciel happy, but that's because I want to see Ciel happy. Maybe Ciel feels the same way. That's enough.

Our existence is natural, we need each other, we want to make each other happy, and just being together makes us happy. It feels like we're sinking into a bottomless swamp, but if we're happy, that's fine. We depend on each other, but it's not a negative relationship. At least, that's what I think.

"So Ain, you can't disappear anymore, okay?"
"I understand."
"Is that the end of the conversation?"

Ciel reminds me. We weren't reconfirming our relationship, we were talking about what will happen to us from now on. But I feel like I need to say something right away. The main purpose was about the changes that will happen to Ciel when becoming a god.

Oh, but come to think of it, there was one more thing I should have told them earlier.

"There's one more thing I need to tell you right away."
"What is it?"
"The Supreme God will grant Ciel one wish. It's not anything, but it's possible that they might grant it."
"A wish will come true?"
"Whether it's possible or impossible, they will give an oracle."

There are limitations, but since the Supreme God will grant it personally, I think even something unreasonable will be okay. But things like resurrection of the dead, eternal youth, or world domination seem impossible. Becoming a noble seems difficult too. I was thinking about what I would choose, but Ciel seems to have already decided and speaks up.

"I want Ain's body."
"My body?"
"I just want to touch Ain. Ain has a form, so it's not impossible, but what do you think?"
"For now, let's wait for the oracle."

Yeah, waiting for an oracle is amazing. I don't think an oracle will come just because we're waiting for it though.

[Fiiyanamia's mansion, for just one day, it's possible.]

"Wow..."
"Is that the oracle?"
"Ciel heard it too. I think it probably is. I've never experienced it before, so I can't say for sure."
"It's only for one day... well, it can't be helped."
"Is that okay with you, Ciel?"
"If it's what Ciel wants, it's okay."

It's Ciel's wish, so I won't interfere. Rather, Ciel looks like they're taking it for granted. I didn't even think about how that would affect me.

Come to think of it, the Supreme God seemed to know about Ciel's wish. Did they anticipate it? And to think that there are limitations to preparing my body. It feels like we could use something like a homunculus to get around it.
 ---- ◇ ---- 

"Ah... but it seems like it's necessary to have performance that can withstand the power of the gods. In that case, it would become quite technically difficult. It feels like it would be a case of creating a 'man-made god' or a homunculus with the power of the gods."

"Come to think of it, when is Day 1?" 
"I'm not sure. It might be a little troublesome to start counting now. How about tomorrow?" 
"I think someone might be listening to this conversation, so let's be considerate. We should also let Fii know. Since she can finally interact with Ain, we need to make sure she doesn't get in the way."

"I don't think she'll get in the way, but..." 

I'm not sure if my words were heard, but Ciel quickly left the room with great momentum.
