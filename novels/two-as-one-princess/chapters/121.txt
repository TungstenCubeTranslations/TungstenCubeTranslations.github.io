Even during dinner, Lady Fiiyanamia didn't tell us what she was planning. And when she urged us to go to our assigned rooms, hinting that Ciel and I might have something to discuss, we couldn't investigate any further. Ciel seems to be quite fond of this room, which is furnished with higher quality items than even a luxury inn. Especially because the bed is so soft. It might be a reaction to the lifestyle of the Respelgia mansion, not just the meals. If you looked at Ciel now, she might seem like a happy person who finds joy in small things. She probably doesn't even realize how precious that is.

I can't say that I fully understand it either. It's probably something like Ciel being happy on her own terms, and me being happy on my own terms. The rooms at the mansion are well-appointed, so there's nothing to complain about, but it's concerning that Mosa and Sauruna are always nearby. Maybe it's necessary for me to become Lady Fii's daughter.

Although both of them have a low presence, it doesn't mean much to me since I'm always using detection magic. Ciel doesn't seem to mind too much, so it's fine. Since we're not actually going to talk to each other, no one around us can hear. The maids might be bored, but they'll have to bear with it.

Right now, Ciel is sitting on the bed, enjoying its springiness. Next to the bed is a nightstand with tea that Sauruna brewed. Ciel drinks it with relish, and it really is delicious. It has a full-bodied aroma that spreads throughout the mouth, with little bitterness.

"Ein, Ein. There are so many things I want to ask you about."

"What is it?"

I also wanted to talk about Viviana-san's family, but Ciel's question is more important, so I put it aside.

"Well, there are several things, but where should I start? What's our relationship, Ein?"

"Our relationship...?"

I used to think of myself as her parent, a guiding presence that would disappear when no longer needed. To me, Ciel is everything in this new life, my reason for living. It's clear that Ciel also cares about me deeply.

We can't keep our composure without each other. Our current relationship might be described as codependency. However, that's not the answer Ciel is looking for. She wants a connection like parent and child, siblings, or something like that. If we're sisters through Lady Fii, that might be it, but it still feels like something that was added later.

"I'm sorry. I don't know the word to describe this relationship."

"I see...I guess that's how it is."

"But at first, I lived as if I were your parent. But now, I can't say that anymore. It's something more than that."


 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

I can't find the right words to express this emotion, this sensation, this relationship. It's so frustrating.

While listening to my words, Ciel must be feeling anxious.

Perhaps Ciel asked about our relationship because she wanted to obtain a clear and objective understanding, like she did with Fii-sama.

Fii-sama is my mother, but what about me? Even though Ciel is mature for her age, she's still only in elementary or middle school.

"To me, Ciel is the most special and important person. But if Ciel can't be reassured by that, then I'll become anything she wants me to be. I'll be her parent, her sister, her mentor, her best friend, her partner. I'll be everything Ciel desires."

That's all I can say, as pathetic as it sounds.

"Hehe, I see. So it's a 'special relationship without a name,' right?"
"That's how I feel. I don't think I met Ciel's expectations though..."
"No, no. It's fine, it's fine. I was just being too picky. I just wanted Ain to be special. I wanted to make Ain feel special."

Ciel's excuse-like argument makes me happy and embarrassed at the same time. But if Ciel is satisfied, then that's good.

"Um, you said you had other questions, right?"
"Oh, yes, that's right. If Ain is okay with it, I want to know about the world Ain came from."
"My world... It would take a long time to explain everything, so let's just talk about it briefly today."
"That's fine. I'm looking forward to hearing more in the future. So, can you tell me about Ain instead?"

I knew this was coming, but it's not really an interesting story. It's just the short life of an unremarkable man. But if Ciel wants to hear it, I don't mind telling her. My memories are continuous, but I've already come to terms with my past life, so it's okay to talk about it.

"Before I talk about myself, should I explain my world first?"
"Well, the way your world works is probably completely different from this world, so I think it's necessary to understand it before hearing your story."
"I see."

Ciel seems a bit sulky, probably because she wanted to hear my story but now it seems like she won't be able to understand it without prior knowledge. But please forgive me.

"Um, the world I came from is completely different from this world. So, in order to understand my story, I think you need to know a little bit about it."
"I see."
"Simply put, it's a world without magic or magical tools, and there are no monsters."
"Such a place exists? That's strange! It's safe without monsters, but it must be inconvenient without magical tools, right?"

Ciel, who seemed a bit dissatisfied, becomes more interested in the story, so I decide to briefly explain about Earth.

 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

"The world where Ain was in seemed like a difficult place."
"Indeed, it may be so."

I secretly struggled with my response, as Ciel's impression was a bit different from what I had imagined. However, in Ciel's case, she could freely move through the sky, and most dangers could be repelled with my barrier, and many household appliances, including hair dryers, could be substituted with magic. As for communication devices, she probably had no interest in them.

It was just a matter of common sense. Both Ciel and I had little experience with the common sense of this world. There was no basis for comparison. So, looking only at Ciel's experience, I think my existence makes Japan seem more difficult. In reality, both worlds have their difficulties and their strengths, I believe.

However, if Ciel says that Japan is a difficult place, it means that she is satisfied with her current life. It's nice to have been given that.

"I really want to hear Ain's story now, but I'll hold off for now. But my last question is, how should we interact with people in the future?"
"That's also something to consider."

I don't think we can do things the same way we did in Estork. However, I don't think there is a correct answer to how to interact with people, so it's a difficult problem. But somehow, since we have gained power, I think Ciel can do as she pleases.

My role is to protect Ciel when she is exposed to malice. However, it's not good to leave everything to Ciel.

"Well, let's interact with people like a mirror."
"A mirror? What do you mean?"
"If someone is kind to us, we should return the kindness, and if someone shows malice towards us, we should return it."
"I see. So, we should return the kindness to Celia and Carol?"
"That's what I mean, but you don't have to think too deeply about it. If there's anything, I'll point it out."
"Then, how should we deal with people who haven't done anything in particular?"
"I think it's up to Ciel's impression."

I don't know if there are people whom Ciel will have a good impression of at first sight, but that's that. I don't particularly want Ciel to be a good girl. I don't even want her to become a saint who gives love to everyone.

"In that case, is it okay?"
"Let's get used to it as we go. We have a support system that can handle anything. If Ciel ever gets tired of dealing with people, it's not a bad idea to cut off contact with the outside world and spend time at Fii-sama's mansion. If you help out with the mansion's affairs, I think she'll forgive you. At worst, you could hide in the forest like you said before."
"Is that okay with Ain?"
"If Ciel is with me, it's okay."
"Hehe, I can be anywhere if Ain is with me."

What I'm looking for is Ciel's happiness. If Ciel is happy, I can be happy too. So, if Ciel chooses based on her own thoughts, I will gladly accept it.

"Well, I understand, Ain. Thank you for listening to me."
"No problem, I'll always be there to listen to you. There's something I want to talk to Ciel about too."
"Oh, what is it? What is it?"

Since Ciel's story seemed to be over, I changed the subject and Ciel adjusted her posture to listen.

"Do you remember the introduction letter we received from Viviana-san?"
"Oh, that's right. Wasn't it to get a backing?"
"Yes, that's right."
"If that's the case, it's already okay, right?"
"That's true, but I want to at least let Viviana-san know what happened."
"Dealing with people is such a hassle. Then, should we go to the Hunter's Guild tomorrow? Today, we didn't even receive the A-rank certificate because of Fii."
 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- 

Certainly, now that you mention it, that's true. At the same time, I think Fii-sama's mother is quite free, and I'm starting to enjoy my own escape.

"If that's the case, should we start by looking for Celia-san? She's a staff member, so I think she's the easiest to find."

"In that case, shouldn't Ain handle it? I haven't directly talked to Carol or Celia yet."

"Come to think of it, that's true. However, Ciel should handle it. If necessary, I'll handle it too, but those two should be okay even if we tell them the situation. ...They might even have noticed something. I have a memory that feels like I gave them a hint."

I honestly don't remember what was said. It was two years ago, after all. Ciel's brain is excellent, but I'm the one who uses it, and the memory capacity is probably more spiritual than cerebral. So, it's my fault that I'm missing.

"If it's Celia and the others, it should be okay as a practice for socializing. There's nothing we need to hide, right?"

"I don't think so."

We were talking with the fools' gathering anyway. That being said, Ciel started to look sleepy, so we ended the conversation and decided to sing a lullaby.
