Upon coming to his senses, Xia Ge quickly helped the girl under him up and asked with concern, "Are you okay?"

The girl from the restaurant was pale and replied, "I'm...thank you, young master..."

"Can you walk?" Xia Ge looked at Gu Peiju, who was facing off against two people in raincoats, feeling nervous as he asked.

"I can walk..."

"Xia Wuyin, take her away from here." Gu Peiju glanced at Xia Ge and spoke calmly.

Xia Ge quickly agreed and carefully observed the movements of two demonic cult disciples not far away. He helped the girl out from behind Gu Peiju and left the restaurant.

"Thank you for saving me."

The girl from the restaurant finally breathed a sigh of relief after leaving the restaurant and showed a hint of fear on her face. "If it weren't for you..."

"It's okay, it wasn't me who saved you. If it weren't for the big shot inside, we would have to explain ourselves here today." Xia Ge scratched the back of his head and smiled, "But if you really want to thank me, how about not charging me for the wine next time?"

"Of course."

Xia Ge was about to be happy, but he saw the girl from the restaurant shyly smile and her eyes glimmered. "Speaking of which, I still have a barrel of more than ten-year-old daughter red wine here. Would you like to taste it, young master?"

Xia Ge: "..."

The girl from the restaurant covered her mouth and chuckled, "Don't be afraid, young master. This daughter red wine is also free of charge."

No, no, no, miss, this is not about whether it's free or not...

System: "Tsk tsk tsk..."

Xia Ge: "Well, peach blossom wine is good enough. Daughter red wine is too strong...I can't hold my liquor...Ah, miss, please find a place to hide. It's chaotic here..."

"Young master, at least leave your name for me."

The young girl held Xia Ge's hand with her white wrist and spoke softly.

"I, I, I, I, I...hahaha, my name is Xia Ge. Xia as in summer and Ge as in singing...no, it's Xia as in summer and Ge as in song. Miss, you should go back quickly..."

"Young master hasn't asked for my name yet."

What the hell, she changed her way of addressing herself? And still using "me" as a pronoun?

Â 
The touch made Xia Ge shudder. It was the first time she had encountered such a situation, and she felt a bit embarrassed as she asked, "What's your name?"

The system replied, "Oops, the situation has turned sour."

Xia Ge remained silent.

"I am called Mo Qiu Ran," the girl replied with a smile. "Young master, you must come to my house for a drink next time."

While Xia Ge and Mo Qiu Ran were flirting, tensions were rising inside the house.

"Brother, they've all escaped."

The person in the straw raincoat, holding half a string of white paper blades, sounded a bit aggrieved. "The blades couldn't kill them all. The blades are useless."

"It's okay."

A young voice rang out, three parts gentle, but it belonged to another person in a straw raincoat, holding a white short flute. "Brother will help you kill them all."

Upon hearing this, Gu Peijiu's eyes suddenly sharpened. She swung her red diamond, sweeping towards the two people!

"Whoosh!"

The flying red diamond broke the table and chairs of the two people. Although the soft and delicate Ling Luo seemed like nothing, it was now as sharp as a blade. The two people in straw raincoats jumped in different directions, but Gu Peijiu's attack was fierce. The person holding the white paper blades couldn't dodge and had his hat knocked off by the red diamond. The tavern was brightly lit, and everyone saw the pale face of the young boy.

It was the face of a seven or eight-year-old child, full of childishness, but his eyes were unusually large and lifeless. His red lips and white skin made him look like a ghostly child from the underworld.

"Ah... I'm so angry. I got swept away," the person holding the white paper blades said in a crisp voice. "Brother, I'm so angry."

The other person in the straw raincoat narrowed his black pupils under his hat and put the short white flute to his lips.

Gu Peijiu swung her red diamond again, and the ghostly Ling Luo instantly made a bend in mid-air, sweeping towards the head of the person holding the white flute!

The person holding the white flute dodged and, in the next moment, a sharp and cold sound of the flute suddenly rang out. A strange fluctuation spread with the sound of the flute, wave after wave!

This was the white flute that summoned puppets!

Gu Peijiu's pupils contracted, and she quickly retracted her red diamond, disappearing from the tavern in a flash.

Meanwhile, Xia Ge had just managed to get rid of the girl named Qiu Ran when she felt her collar being pulled. She was lifted off the ground.
"...... Hmm? Ah?"

The strong wind blew against her face, making it impossible for her to speak. The familiar scent of peach blossom mixed with the cool scent of sandalwood, creating a unique fragrance.

... Senior Sister?

Is she trying to escape?

It makes sense. Although there are only two people in the village, there may be an ambush by the demon cult outside the village. It's hard to fight off four hands with just two fists. If she runs away too, then what's the difference... She must be the fastest runner.

The girl moved quickly and lightly, even faster than Xia Ge's upgraded Ghost Shadow Dance. She held Xia Ge in her left hand and kept throwing yellow talismans with her right hand. Xia Ge watched as those talismans, completely incomprehensible when drawn with cinnabar, were pasted onto the door of the corresponding house in this small village in a strange order by the girl.

It wasn't until Gu Peiju had pasted a circle of talismans that Xia Ge realized that Gu Peiju wasn't taking her to escape.

She's setting up a formation!

At the same time, a sharp and mournful flute sound rang out again...

The roof of the tavern's small house was suddenly broken open, and two short, cloaked dwarves flew into the air from the broken roof. The cloaks that concealed them were thrown off in mid-air to avoid hindering their movements. Two boys in white clothes floated in mid-air, one holding a string of paper blades that rustled in the night wind, and the other holding a white short flute. The area below his left eye was painted with dark black pigment, as if it were a tear. The two of them flew high in the air, like ghosts, looking down on all living things.

Gu Peiju landed on the ground, put Xia Ge down, and looked up at the two demon cult boys above her. Her black eyes were deep and heavy. "Xia Wuyin."

"Here!" Xia Ge stood at attention.

"We're leaving the village."

The bright moonlight shone down, reflecting her gentle face and clear voice. "Are you afraid?"

"..."

Leave the village? Isn't that running away? Why be afraid of running away?

Xia Ge was confused.

... Anyway, it's definitely a good impression to impress the superiors with bravery!

This is a big shot that can give her a raise!

In a flash, Xia Ge raised her head and chest. "Not afraid!"

As soon as she finished speaking, Xia Ge heard the desperate voice of the system. "Host... that person just played the flute."
Xia Ge was confused and asked, "What happened when he played the flute?"

The system replied, "I observed that he just played a note, which probably summoned over a thousand A-level demonized puppets outside the village..."

Xia Ge was shocked and exclaimed, "Why didn't you tell me this earlier?!"

Just as she was about to express her deep concern to her senior sister, she looked up and saw a girl with a red hairband looking at her with deep, starry eyes.

Xia Ge was momentarily stunned.

"What... do you want to say?" she asked.

"Swish, swish, swish..."

The girl obviously didn't give them a chance to chat. Countless paper blades rained down from the sky!

"Koko, koko, koko... Die quickly!"

"The feeling of killing Danfeng's senior disciple... must be wonderful, right, brother, brother? Let me kill her, okay?"

The voice of the child was innocent but filled with killing intent!

"Clang, clang, clang..."

Gu Peijiu's Hongling swept lightly, and the fierce paper blades in mid-air were like nothing under the soft Hongling, which overcame the strong with the weak.

As the red silk fluttered over her head, blocking the rolling killing intent, Xia Ge felt her body become light again, but this time she fell into a soft embrace.

The girl rose into the air, the red silk fluttering in the night breeze, and Xia Ge heard a gentle voice.

"Xia Wuyin, you are very brave."

"I will protect you."

"Let's break out together."

No... the bravery just now was just an illusion...

It was true.
"If she knew there were a thousand A-grade puppets outside, she wouldn't boast like this even if she were beaten to death!"

However, obviously Gu Peiju could no longer care about her mood. She hugged her, her body surrounded by red petals, soft yet extremely tough, blocking all the paper blades outside.

Suddenly, Xia Ge reacted belatedly.

She was... being carried by Danfeng's senior sister... like a princess?

The cold sandalwood mixed with the taste of peach blossom wine drifted into her heart in the chilly wind, warm and moving.

Xia Ge: "..."

Under the peony blossoms, one dies like a hero, even as a ghost, one remains stylish!

This is a 3S-grade beauty!

Gu Peiju didn't know what the little troublemaker in her arms was thinking. She walked lightly, taking three steps in one stride, and soon arrived outside the village.

"Ah... brother, is she looking for death?"

The sound of a blade was crisp.

The white-clothed young man on the other side did not answer, but the two of them followed Gu Peiju and arrived outside the village.

"Close your eyes."

Before leaving the village, the girl's voice was cold. "Don't look."

But it was too late.

Xia Ge saw it.

The vast and flickering forest blue soul fire in her eye sockets, covering the sky and the earth outside the village, making people shudder.

In mid-air, the boy who followed them laughed strangely, "Kukukuâ€”Gu Peiju, not only will you die, but the villagers will also die nowâ€”"

He suddenly widened his eyes and stared down at the red and white maple clothes of the girl holding the boy in her arms from a high position, with a sinister and strange tone, "Those villagers died because of you! It's all because you're alive, all because you appeared here, that they diedâ€”they were innocent, they were all killed because of youâ€”"

What nonsense!

Xia Ge was about to argue, but suddenly everything went black in front of her.
The gentle red silk ribbon covered her eyes, blocking out all the terrifying demonic puppets outside.

"I won't let anyone die."

Xia Ge felt herself being put down, the faint scent of sandalwood and peach blossom mixing with the cold soil outside the village. The girl's voice was light.

The girl's voice was calm, but it was like a glimmer of light, giving those in the darkness an inexplicable strength.

"It's because I'm here that no one will die."

She couldn't see anything in the darkness.

"Roar!"

The terrifying roar of the demonic puppet echoed in her ears, like an evil spirit.

"As expected of the senior disciple..."

The young boy holding the white flute laughed softly, placing the flute lightly at his lips. "But no matter how powerful you are, with these thousand puppets bidding you farewell, this place is destined to be your burial ground!"

The sound of the flute suddenly rang out!

"Hahahaâ€”hate, hate that you have such a disgusting name as 'Pei Jiu'!" Xia Ge heard the mad laughter of the white-clad figure, and the sound of paper blades slashing through the air. "You'd better go dieâ€”Gu, Pei, Jiu!"

The red ribbon covering her eyes was very soft. Xia Ge tore open a small gap and peeked out, only to be frightened back a step!

Countless demonic puppets, each one as terrifying as an evil spirit, were charging towards them!

Mighty and unstoppable, shaking the heavens and earth!

Xia Ge was dumbfounded!

She had been in this novel for five or six years, but had never seen such a large-scale battle before!

"Don't be afraid."

As if sensing the boy's movement behind her, Gu Pei Jiu's usually cold voice softened slightly. Xia Ge watched as she casually threw a talisman paper onto a wutong tree at the entrance of the village. "I'm here."

The talisman paper on the tree trunk suddenly burst into flames!

"Clang!"
As the violent demonized puppets rushed forward, they "bang" into a golden barrier. Xia Ge looked up in amazement and saw that just as the talisman on the tree burnt out, a huge golden shield descended from the sky, covering the entire village and herself within it!

The demonized puppets outside pounded the barrier relentlessly, making a banging sound. The faces of the two children outside the barrier changed slightly.

Xia Ge suddenly remembered the yellow talisman that Gu Peijiu threw around before they left...

So this was her formation...

"Hmph."

Bai Luo sneered, waved his white flute, and countless puppets roared. Xia Ge watched as a puppet with a blue glow ignited flames in its hand and punched the barrier, causing the entire shield to begin shaking!

A green light flashed in Xia Ge's eyes: puppet reconnaissance!

[S-class Blue Fire Puppet, skill, Break Formation-]

There were even S-class puppets mixed in!?

"Ah ah- hurry up and let them die- brother-"

The white blade on her head laughed wildly, and her pale face was stained with a crazy blush. "If they're all dead, no one can bully us anymore-"

Xia Ge: "..."

Who the hell bullied you? You're bullying us right now, you bastard!

"Stay inside and don't come out."

Just as Xia Ge was ranting, Gu Peijiu's voice came through calmly, "Don't worry, the barrier won't break."

Xia Ge was at a loss for words.

Gu Peijiu looked at the little boy with half a red diamond in his hand. His black hair was tied up with green hair and he looked up at her, as if he wanted to say something.

For some reason, seeing Xia Wuyin like this made her heart soften.
He is a disciple of the outer sect of Danfeng.

No matter what, he is still just a child.

Now... she has to protect him.

She reached out and touched his head, "Stay here."

Then she turned around and was about to leave the barrier.

"Sister Senior."

As if he had made up his mind, the voice of the young man behind her suddenly sounded, full of seriousness.

"Hmm?"

The red and white maple dress of the young girl, Hongling, fluttered. She turned to look at him, and even though her eyes were filled with moonlight and calm, they were still breathtakingly beautiful.

Xiage felt guilty and remorseful, "Sister Senior, I'm sorry, I won't skip class anymore!!"

Gu Peiju: "..."

System: "..."

The young girl's mood was complicated as she left the barrier, "It has nothing to do with this."

The people of the Demon Cult are just watching her.

There will always be such a day.

Outside the barrier, Gu Peiju was like a piece of meat targeted by a pack of wolves, and countless puppets rushed towards her!

Ling Luo protected her and swept away the puppets in front of Gu Peiju mercilessly. Hongling was sharp and every inch of her blade caused a wound.

"Oh~ not hiding like a turtle anymore?"

The boy with the white flute sneered, "You are really brave, I will leave you a whole corpse!"

Gu Peiju tilted her head slightly and looked up at the two boys in mid-air. After a long while, she spoke softly, "Can you see farther if you stand higher?"

"Can you kill more people if you stand higher?" The boy with the blade shouted wildly, "Gu Peiju, you will die!"

Note: This is a partial translation and may not be accurate or complete.
Xia Ge was inside the barrier, watching several S-class Blue Flame puppets burning with terrifying flames rushing towards Gu Peiju!

...No, she couldn't just sit and wait for death!

But she couldn't leave the barrier either--

Calm down!

Xia Ge observed that outside the barrier, there were many puppets, but most of them were constantly attacking the barrier, trying to break into the protected village. Some of the strongest S-class puppets were rushing towards Gu Peiju, attempting to surround and kill her.

"Roar--"

The sound of the puppets attacking the barrier was low and hoarse, their movements were crazy and mechanical, and their soul flames flickered--

"Ah--"

The heart-wrenching howl was like that of a demon being tortured in hell, making people shudder. Xia Ge was startled, and some terrifying memories began to flood her mind. She instinctively shook her head and took a step back--

A faint, desperate voice suddenly rang out.

Mixed in with the roaring, it was weak and hard to ignore.

"Please..."

"...Save me..."

"I don't want to..."

Xia Ge widened her eyes slightly, what was that voice?

"I don't want to...please..."

It was a puppet!

It was the puppet that was desperately pounding against the barrier!

Xia Ge looked at the flickering blue soul flame of the puppet and vaguely noticed a hint of white mixed in.

This is...

"An almost completely demonized puppet, but not quite there yet."
The voice of the system sounded somewhat subtle, "There is still human consciousness, but they can no longer control their demonized bodies."

"I don't want to... save me, please save me--"

"Ah--"

"Roar--"

The last trace of pure white fireworks was swallowed by the deep blue, and the pitiful and weak voice disappeared, replaced by the puppet's even more violent attack!

"These demonized puppets... were all human beings before?"

Summer Song reacted belatedly, "All of them... are?"

The voice of the system sounded mechanical and ruthless, "Yes, all of them."

Or rather, they were originally.

Human beings turned into demonized puppets...?

Wait a minute! Wait a minute--

Summer Song's pupils suddenly contracted, something hidden in the corner of her memory slowly surfaced.

Demonized puppets, male lead, extermination of a clan, Thousand Souls of the Demon Sect--

And the plot--

Summer Song shuddered and looked up at the two white-clad figures in the air--

The plot of "Endless Wind and Moon" is about to begin!!!

Demonized puppets, demonized puppets, no wonder she knew about this plot when she read the book before, she just didn't remember it. How could she forget such an important thing... she had to do something!

Ye Ze!

The white-clad twin brothers of the Demon Sect, Bai Ren and Bai Luo!

She had been too careless, almost forgetting that she was living in a book!

There was an important plot about the Demon Sect, about Ye Ze... and his parents!
Xia Ge tightly held the wooden puppet in her pocket. Now that the white-clothed disciples of the demonic sect were here, it was an opportunity to get closer to them, no matter what...

What should she do?

"Chirp-"

The last blue fire puppet was mercilessly destroyed by Hong Ling. The soft red ling was infused with qi, and its edges were as sharp as swords, cutting through everything in its path.

"Crackle!"

Gu Peijiu's pupils shrank slightly as she turned her head, seeing a faint crack on the golden barrier!

She couldn't delay any longer.

"Snap-"

White Blade obviously also noticed the crack on the barrier. He laughed heartily, and the slender paper blade in his hand flew out and was inserted directly into the crack before Gu Peijiu could swing her ling!

"If it breaks, they will all die-"

White Blade widened his eyes, his laughter terrifyingly crazy, "You're guilty- just for being alive-"

The sharp sound of the flute became even more terrifying, and the crack on the barrier spread like a spider web with the paper blade shot out by White Blade-

"..."

Xia Ge looked at the crack and clenched the glass puppet in her hand.

How could she get closer to the white-clothed disciple?

"Standing high up, one can kill many people, right?"

The girl's voice was clear like a spring, particularly abrupt amidst the howling of the puppets.

Xia Ge instinctively looked towards Gu Peijiu's direction, holding her breath.

"Yes-" White Blade snorted, looking down from his high position, grinning maliciously, "Especially ants like you-"

"So." The girl in the red and white maple robe raised her head, her black pupils calm and indifferent, the golden light of the barrier mixed with moonlight flowing in her pitch-black eyes, "Standing high up can also save many people, right?"

In the next moment, Hong Ling scattered, and golden threads glittered on the soft red ling. The girl in the red and white maple robe rose into the air, like a red maple riding the wind in autumn. Gu Peijiu's voice was clear and slightly raised, "Like this..."
Xia Ge lost her focus for a moment.

The girl in red and white maple clothes had a clear and melodious voice, every word like a song or poem.

"[One Punishment - Flowing Fire Â· Heaven's Wrath]."

- Even if you have no heart or emotion.
- But when you are in a high position.
- You should live for redemption.

As soon as she finished speaking, the world changed in an instant!

The girl, who rode the wind, easily stood at the highest point higher than the white-robed boy. The rolling red silk piled up beside her, spreading like an endless vine, covering the entire sky within sight. Then it scattered into thin strands, and in the moment when the girl's voice fell, the clear night sky was covered with dark clouds, lightning, and thunder. The scattered red diamonds penetrated the black clouds stained with lightning, and the dark night sky was dyed with rolling blood-red. The moonlight disappeared - as the black clouds and mist rolled, thunder roared, and flowing fire fell from the sky in a blink of an eye!

Xia Ge widened her eyes, "Holy shit..."

The thunderous flames were like a demon descending from the sky, and the red diamonds shuttled and danced in the flames. The majestic flowing fire fell from the sky in strings, and outside the barrier, it became a tragic sea of fire in the blink of an eye!

"Ah-"

The sharp screams of the puppets being burned rose and fell, and amidst the raging winds and clouds, the faces of the two white-robed boys in mid-air turned pale -

"How is this possible...?"

Bai Ren muttered, "Impossible... impossible!"

Before he could finish speaking, countless blazing flames flew towards him!

"Boom-"

Bai Luo waved his hand, and a semi-transparent white barrier instantly blocked the flowing fire, but the strong impact shattered the barrier, and a trace of blood spilled from Bai Luo's mouth. "Go-"

"...It's the Heaven's Wrath Silk!!!"

Bai Ren screamed, looking up at the girl above his head. "Gu Peijiu, the Heaven's Wrath Silk is actually in your hands!!!"

"Hurry up!"

Bai Luo hoarsely shouted, and the violent flowing fire flew towards them. He grabbed Bai Ren's collar and threw him towards the direction of the village -
Amidst the flowing flames, a girl dressed in red and white maple leaves floated around her. Her jet-black pupils were dyed a bright color by the overwhelming flames, but her face remained calm and collected. The soft red cloth shimmered with a brilliant light, "Second Punishment - Fire of Karma: Earth Annihilation!"

"Boom!"

The earth began to tremble! The flat land suddenly cracked into numerous terrifying crevices amid violent shaking, causing countless puppets to fall into the cracks. Then, the scorching magma gushed out from the broken cracks!

The scorching magma, screaming puppets, and the world that turned into a purgatory in the blink of an eye.

Thousands of puppets were destroyed in an instant, without any reason.

Heavenly punishment, earth annihilation.

Flowing flames and magma, heavenly punishment and earth annihilation.

Ancient clothes and demons, heavenly punishment silk!!!

In Xia Ge's eyes, there were only blazing flames and a strong smell of scorched earth.

Powerful, without any reason for being powerful.

Absolute, powerful.

Was this the power of Double S?

Xia Ge thought of the source of that sentence, which was the evaluation of Lingxi's senior disciple in "Endless Wind and Moon."

Those who could become senior disciples could single-handedly resist a million soldiers to protect a mountain.

- Single-handedly resist a million soldiers.

Just as Xia Ge was shocked to the point of wanting to lie down and shout "666" on the ground.

It seemed that the barrier couldn't withstand the tremendous impact from outside, and the spider web-like cracks on it suddenly expanded countless times -

System: [Host, be careful!]

"Bang!"

A sharp paper blade pierced through the barrier, coldly brushing past her ear, and "chih" sound pierced the damp dirt road behind her.

"Snap!"
The golden barrier suddenly shattered into countless pieces!

"Bang!"

Then a white figure fell from the sky, and the white blade thrown by Bai Luo hit Xia Ge's body, catching her off guard. Her neck was grabbed and she was slammed onto the ground due to the inertia, and the two of them rolled into a ball.

What the hell?!

When Xia Ge regained her senses after rolling with the unexpected object, she found the sharp paper blade against her neck, leaving a red blood mark. The white face of the blade looked ghostly under the raging flames, and her black eyes were filled with bloodshot veins. "I'll kill you..."

Blade...?

Xia Ge was surprised and delighted, as she was thinking hard about how to approach the member of the demonic cult. "Wow, what a godsend!"

The flames behind her reflected the pale face of Bai Tong and her desperate determination to kill at least one of the Lingxi Peak's lackeys, if not Gu Peiju.

As the blade lifted her hand to strike, she suddenly met a pair of deep purple pupils!

- Soul Stealing -

All of Blade's movements froze.

The boy took out a small puppet from his pocket, his purple eyes deep and unfazed by the sharp blade against his neck. He grinned, "Don't be so fierce, come on, big brother will show you a treasure."

System: "..."

Jianfeng.

The earth shook and the sky roared, making it difficult to sleep.

"Miss!"

Little Cui's voice sounded panicked and anxious outside the door. "Miss, wake up, there's a strange phenomenon happening in the sky!"

Chu Yao opened her eyes, her light brown pupils filled with anger. She was wearing a white dress, her black hair cascading down her shoulders, and holding a sword in one hand. She casually pulled open the bamboo curtain on the window.

Blood red.

The originally pitch-black sky was now dyed with terrifying flames, with no stars or moon in sight. Countless flowing fires rolled down from the red sky, and the earth trembled loudly. Even from a distance, the smell of burning lava was clear.
Chu Yao's light brown pupils slightly contracted, she suddenly dropped the bamboo curtain, put on her blue and white swordsmanship robe, tied on her long sword, and disappeared in a flash.

Lingxi Peak.

The old man looked up at the rolling red sky and sighed softly.

"Jiu'er..."

Beast Peak.

"Chirp, chirp~"

The yellow-feathered bird flew around and finally landed on the fingertip of the man in the beast robe. He stood on the top of Beast Peak, looking at the red sky in the distance, and a strange light appeared in his black eyes.

Outside the village.

At the moment the barrier shattered, Gu Peiju stopped her attack.

The flowing fire gradually extinguished, and the magma gradually stopped.

But whether it was an A-level puppet or an S-level blue fire puppet, they undoubtedly turned into scorched corpses in this heavenly punishment.

The red and white maple dress girl floated in mid-air above the sky, her red diamond-shaped skirt fluttering, the flowing fire gathered and dispersed, and the golden light was like an illusion.

Bai Luo, holding a white flute, suffered a huge backlash from the destruction of a large number of puppets and was spitting blood. On the other side, the paper blade was pressed against the neck of the boy, and his whole body was stiff.

Gu Peiju silently looked at the shattered barrier and Xia Wuyin who was being held hostage. The Tianzhu Ling was wrapped around her hand, and her voice was faint, "You went to such great lengths just to kill me?"

The paper blade turned his back to Gu Peiju and said nothing. He stared at the deep purple eyes of the boy in front of him. Xia Ge's voice was light and indifferent, "Now, the first command, answer her with what you want to say to her."

As if being punched, the paper blade regained his senses. He still stared at the boy blankly, without looking at Gu Peiju in the sky behind him. His voice was extremely sinister, "My goal was originally to kill you, Gu Peiju!"

"Very well, very well." Xia Ge slightly curved his lips and stuffed the wooden puppet in his hand into the paper blade's pocket. "Now, the second command, take this puppet, hold me hostage, and escape with your brother."

"â€¦Yes."

As soon as the words fell, the paper blade tightly held Xia Ge, pulled her up from the ground, pressed the paper blade against her neck, and looked at Gu Peiju in the sky. Under his cold black pupils, there was a faint sense of confusion.

...Obey, command.

Escape, with his brother.
"Take care, little puppet.

Holding... the master.

Xia Ge was suddenly choked by this guy and almost suffocated. He felt annoyed and thought, can't he be more gentle?!

Gu Peijiu looked coldly at the white blade and said, "Let him go."

On the other side, while Gu Peijiu's attention was drawn by the white blade, Bai Luo, who was hiding under the puppet's charred body, trembled as he reached into his pocket and took out a talisman. He fiercely lifted the puppet off his body, and in a flash, he appeared beside the white blade, grabbed his collar with one hand, and said in a low voice, "Blade, we should go."

The white blade instinctively let go, and the paper blade left Xia Ge's neck. He looked at Xia Ge's purple pupils, dazed and lifeless.

"Swish!"

The red silk fabric rushed towards the white blade like a knife, just as he let go of Xia Ge. Bai Luo hugged the white blade and rolled away, avoiding the Heavenly Punishing Cord. He then crushed the talisman in his hand.

"We won't let you go, Gu Peijiu."

"You better be careful--"

Bai Luo's voice was extremely cold, and with the shattering of the talisman, both of them disappeared.

At the moment when the white blade left, Xia Ge closed her purple eyes and lay down on the ground. After a moment of silence, she suddenly giggled when she heard someone approaching.

"You're really amazing, senior sister."

She said.

Beside her, the girl in red and white maple clothes, Hong Ling, stopped and looked at the bloodshot wound on her neck. "You're injured."

She felt a little guilty.

"It's okay."

Xia Ge deliberately gave them a chance to escape, tilting her head and still smiling, "It's nothing."

Gu Peijiu leaned over, and her slender fingers gently touched the scar on Xia Ge's neck. In the smell of burning soil, the girl's white sleeves embroidered with red maple leaves emitted a light fragrance. In the darkness, the scent of peach blossom wine mixed with sandalwood was particularly distinct.

Xia Ge was slightly lost in thought.

"Does it hurt?"
The girl's voice was like a clear spring, with a hint of gentleness in its coldness.

"...it doesn't hurt."

Gu Peijiu didn't say anything more.

"Senior Sister, you're amazing." Xia Ge snapped out of his daze and heard himself say, "You're the most amazing person I've ever seen in my life."

Heavens and earth, Gu Peijiu thought silently, and took out a white gauze from her sleeve, quickly bandaging the boy's neck.

"Why are your eyes closed?" she asked.

The usually talkative boy fell silent this time.

Don't want to say?

Gu Peijiu didn't mind. She asked the question not necessarily because she wanted an answer.

After bandaging him up, she picked up the boy. In the rush of the moment, she hadn't noticed, but now she realized that this child named Xia Wuyin was thin and light.

Not emaciated, but really without any extra flesh.

And he was injured.

Gu Peijiu was a little lost in thought.

-She had asked him to stand there, within the barrier, and he had stood there.

Without moving, but still injured.

This was her responsibility.

She couldn't shirk it.

"Let's go, Xia Wuyin."

Perhaps out of pity, Gu Peijiu's voice softened, with a tone that was like comforting a child, "I'm going to take you out of here."
Warm breath and a gentle voice.

Embraced in the scent of alcohol.

Feeling safe.

"I'll take you out."

The breeze gently brushed against the red and white maple clothed girl, holding a young boy in coarse clothes, stepping on a ground covered in burnt puppet corpses, where the smell of burnt earth mixed with the fragrance of incense. Xia Ge heard her own voice.

"I heard...if you close your eyes, you won't see ghosts."

Clearly, this wasn't a reason.

Clearly, it was because of soul-stealing.

But for some reason, she suddenly wanted to say it.

To say it to the person with the warm embrace.

Although it was just a meaningless excuse.

"There are no ghosts," Gu Peijiu said.

You said there are no ghosts, so there are no ghosts, do ghosts not have any face?

Xia Ge silently cursed in her heart.

"If there were evil ghosts, closing your eyes would still harm you," Gu Peijiu said.

Xia Ge didn't say anything, just tightened her grip on Gu Peijiu's Danfeng silk clothes.

The moonlit night was cool.

"If you want to close your eyes, then close them," the gentle wind mixed with the girl's clear voice, "You can close your eyes until morning, and evil ghosts won't harm you."

With her here, evil ghosts wouldn't harm her.

Xia Ge didn't say anything, just nestled her head against Gu Peijiu's chest.

Gu Peijiu didn't think anything was wrong and flew with Xia Ge towards Lingxi Peak.
Meanwhile.

Gu Peiju brought Xia Ge back to the mountain, while Chu Yao rushed over with a sword, only to see a ground full of broken and burnt corpses, and the lingering fire clouds in the sky.

"Tsk, am I too late?"

With a snort, Chu Yao turned around to leave, but her peripheral vision caught a paper blade stuck in the ground.

She frowned, picked up the paper blade with her sword, a soft and slender strip of white paper with a sharp end. She infused her inner energy into it, and in the blink of an eye, it straightened and emitted sword aura.

"Thousand Soul Twin, White Blade Bai Luo?"

Chu Yao sneered, and the white paper blade that was emitting sword aura was suddenly engulfed by the flames. She stood up and hummed, "Trash."

The scene of raining fire and flowing magma could not have been caused by those two trash from the Demon Cult.

The cracking sound of a small twig being stepped on suddenly rang out.

"Who's there!"

The long sword flew out, the sharp blade flashing under the cold moonlight, and "clang" pierced into the ground next to the source of the sound!

Behind the wutong tree at the village entrance, a man wearing coarse cloth and hemp clothes was suddenly frightened, trembling all over, with both hands raised high, "Miss! Miss... spare me! I... I am from the Mo family village..."

"Oh?"

Chu Yao raised her hand, and the long sword flew back to her hand. She casually made a sword flower and squinted her eyes, "A villager from the village? What are you doing here in the middle of the night?"

"I... I was sent by the village chief to see... to see what happened..." He swallowed his saliva, still trembling.

Chu Yao smiled faintly, her light brown eyes shining, "Oh? Then tell me, who was fighting here just now?"

"It seems that the people from the Demon Cult were chasing after Gu Peiju from the Lingxi Peak...?" The man saw that Chu Yao seemed to have no intention of killing him, and he relaxed a bit.

Gu Peiju?

A glimmer flashed in Chu Yao's eyes, the big disciple appointed by the head of the Lingxi Peak, Gu Peiju?

She glanced at the cracked ground, the traces of magma and fire, and the piles of puppet corpses, like a purgatory on earth under the cold moonlight.

"Tell me everything you know." Chu Yao said coldly, the frost sword flowing with sharp moonlight, "I want you to tell me everything, from beginning to end, without missing a single detail."
The man shuddered under the fierce killing intent and quickly said, "At that time, there was a girl named Gu Peijiu drinking with a young boy with a green hairband in the tavern..."

"A young boy with a green hairband?"

"I'm called Xia Ge."

"That's enough."

"...Why is he everywhere?"

"Is it really such a coincidence?"

Chu Yao tightened her grip on her sword and continued to listen.

"Afterward, I ran out and don't know what happened..."

"I know."

Chu Yao said, "You can go back and tell the villagers that everything is fine."

The man felt like he had been granted amnesty and turned around to run. However, after only taking three steps, the cold voice of the female swordsman behind him sounded again, "Stop!"

The man stopped and turned back, trembling. "Miss, you..."

In the hazy moonlight, the girl in blue and white sword robes had a light blue hairband that fluttered in the breeze. "...Do you know who the young boy with the green hairband who was with Gu Peijiu is?"

"This..." The man hesitated.

Chu Yao snorted, "I'm just asking casually. If you don't know, forget it-"

"He seems to be someone I know."

"Earlier, when I came, I heard from the Autumn Dye girl at the tavern that a young master named 'Xia Ge' with a green hairband saved her. He should also be the young master who was drinking with Gu Peijiu. I don't know if he's the young master you know."

Chu Yao: "..."

...It really was that annoying little hero who was everywhere!
