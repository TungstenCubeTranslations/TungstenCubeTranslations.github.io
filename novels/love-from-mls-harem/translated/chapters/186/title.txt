Chapter 182: Your Eyes

Your eyes were like stars in the night sky, shining with a brilliance that I couldn't help but be drawn to. They were deep pools of mystery, and every time I looked into them, I felt as if I were falling into a bottomless abyss.

I couldn't help but wonder what secrets lay hidden behind those eyes, what dreams and aspirations you held deep within your heart. I wanted to know everything about you, to unravel the mysteries that surrounded you and discover the person that lay beneath.

But even as I gazed into your eyes, I knew that some secrets were meant to remain hidden, that some mysteries were meant to remain unsolved. And so I contented myself with simply admiring the beauty that lay before me, with basking in the warmth of your gaze and the comfort of your presence.

For in your eyes I found a kind of peace that I had never known before, a sense of belonging that made me feel as if I had finally found my place in the world. And so I cherished every moment that I spent with you, every glance and every smile, knowing that in your eyes I had found something truly special.
