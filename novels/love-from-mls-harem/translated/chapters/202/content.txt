"However, reality is often not as easy as imagined." Dou Dou's voice was faint. "The Wenqing Sword can only suppress calamity for a moment, but not for a lifetime."

Gu Peijiu looked towards the illusion.

It was a cold winter night.

The leader of the white-clad puppet was unable to withstand the calamity and borrowed the "verbal spirit" of Xia Wushuang's body to break through the Wenqing Sword's formation.

"Do you think you can stop me?" The blood-eyed girl held a long sword and smiled wickedly. She walked towards Gu Peijiu, half-closing one eye and lifting her chin with the sword handle. Her voice was arrogant. "Kneel down obediently for me!"

Gu Peijiu's pupils shrank, and the next moment, her knees seemed to have fallen under a thousand-pound boulder, uncontrollably kneeling towards Xia Wushuang!

"Interesting, really interesting, hahaha-" Xia Wushuang laughed wildly, squinting her eyes. "Just kneel here - hahaha, or... you can accompany me to kill people?"

Gu Peijiu raised her eyes and looked at her.

Her pitch-black eyes were like a deep snowy night without stars or moon, but they carried a powerful deterrent force!

The next moment, the Wenqing Sword shone with divine light!

Xia Wushuang suddenly threw the sword away and took three steps back. "Tsk," she said, "... it's really troublesome."

The Wenqing Sword drew a circle in mid-air, and then fell on the snow.

The divine light went out.

Gu Peijiu lowered her head slightly, forcibly activating the power of her soul, making her feel a little weak.

"Tsk... but killing still requires a handy weapon, right?" Xia Wushuang laughed again, picked up the sword, looked at Gu Peijiu, squinted her eyes and smiled. "This sword will be especially beautiful when stained with blood."

She held the sword in one hand and the scabbard in the other, licked the "Wenqing" characters engraved on the bamboo scabbard, and after provoking to the extreme, she turned and left.

Gu Peijiu knelt on the cold snow, watching her leave.

... There was a small village not far from the foot of Lingxi Mountain.

... She must, must stop her!!

She absolutely, absolutely cannot-
Gu Peijiu struggled to break free from the control of the "verbal spirit" of the puppeteer, but the puppeteer's "verbal spirit" was absolute in its control over the puppet, unless--

Someone came through the snow.

She looked up and saw Su Chan.

The girl in red clenched her hands, her face somewhat pale, as if struggling and hesitating over something.

"Did you see her?" Gu Peijiu got straight to the point.

"..." Su Chan said, "Yes, I did."

"Why didn't you stop her?!" Gu Peijiu asked, "You know what she--"

"Why should I stop her?" Su Chan was annoyed by her presumption and asked back, "...It's what she wants to do, why should I stop her?"

"That's not her!!" Gu Peijiu said.

"...I can't tell the difference." Su Chan said, "Even if it's a curse, as long as it's what she wants to do, I--"

"That's not what she wants to do." Gu Peijiu stared at her, word by word, "That, is not."

Su Chan was provoked by Gu Peijiu's firm attitude: "You know her very well?! Who are you to act like you know everything--"

"I don't know her." Gu Peijiu said, "But I won't misunderstand her."

Su Chan laughed angrily and taunted her, "Then you go do it! I won't do it! So what if we kill a few ants, and even if we kill them all, she will always be herself! And--"

"You're just a wooden block that can't do anything!"

She paused and whispered, "Do you know, I followed her down the mountain--the way she killed people was really beautiful--"

"The villagers' screams...the blood staining her clothes...the amaryllis on the hem of her dress..."

"Shut up!!" Gu Peijiu shouted in anger.

The next moment!

The dark night sky was illuminated, the wind and snow howled, the evergreen trees shook and the violent wind and snow swept in. The forehead of the white puppet lit up with a mysterious symbol, and its black eyes also lit up with abnormal blue starlight!

"What are you going to do?!" Su Chan's pupils shrank.
"I am a heartless guest," murmured the white puppet, "I seek what I love."

"Do you want to break the puppet curse?! Are you going to betray her?!" Su Chan asked in shock.

Xia Wushuang had already handed over all the control of the puppets to Gu Peijiu. Once Gu Peijiu turned against her, Xia Wushuang would be like a lamb to the slaughter!

"Turn against her? No..." Gu Peijiu said, "I want to protect her."

As soon as she finished speaking, the mysterious symbol on the forehead of the white puppet shattered instantly!

The spoken words lost their effect!

Gu Peijiu's eyes gleamed, and the next moment she disappeared without a trace!

Su Chan stood still, clenching his fists tightly.

The wind and snow roared.

In the village, the cries of children echoed in the sky. People fled in a panic. Xia Wushuang held a blood-stained sword, her blood-red pupils filled with excitement. However, the next moment, her pupils shrank slightly, and she suddenly swung her sword back!

"Boom!"

Snow water splashed, and the waves of frenzy swept around, causing houses to collapse and people to scream!

"Ghost ah -"

"Ah ah ah help -"

"Someone is slaughtering the village -"

In the raging wind and waves, Xia Wushuang's black hair was wild, and her blood-red pupils widened as she looked at the puppet who blocked her questioning sword. "...I couldn't trap you?"

Gu Peijiu's eyes were cold, "You, stop."

Xia Wushuang laughed, and her long sword slashed fiercely, "What are you? You might as well die."

This sentence had the power of spoken words.

"Clang-"

Gu Peijiu caught the sword without changing her expression and said calmly, "...You should go back now."
Xia Wushuang's pupils slightly contracted.

... Did the language spirit fail?

She was a little confused, not understanding why the language spirit that was one hundred percent effective against this troublesome guard dog suddenly lost all its effect.

Just as she was confused, her neck suddenly hurt, her vision went black, and she instantly lost all consciousness.

Gu Peiju lifted the person who was about to fall to the ground with one hand, picked up the sword on the ground, and disappeared in a few teleports while people were still in chaos.

The illusion disappeared.

Gu Peiju looked at Dou Dou.

"Afterwards..." Dou Dou's voice, "Su Chan said I would definitely regret it."

"But I don't care." Dou Dou's voice was soft. "I love this person. Because I love her, I want to protect her, protect her world, and protect everything she wants to protect."

"... Only this way."

"Can I feel that I have found myself..."

"Can I feel free."

Gu Peiju asked, "After breaking free from the puppet curse, didn't she notice?"

"She didn't notice." Dou Dou said, "After I awakened my consciousness in Yundu, Xia Wushuang never used the language spirit on me again."

The language spirit can make puppets obedient, but after the puppet awakens and has emotions, Xia Wushuang never used it on her again.

She really regarded Gu Peiju as a "companion", and even if she occasionally complained "she's really a puppet..." without understanding her heart, she genuinely regarded her as a "partner".

"... Sometimes she doesn't want me to follow her, she just says it." Dou Dou said, "The language spirit is the most direct thing that tests the relationship between puppets and puppet masters, maybe... there are also emotions."

"Puppets will crave the absolute trust of their puppet masters." Dou Dou said, "It will always, always crave this."

Even if she betrayed, even if the bond was broken, even if there were reincarnations, even if everything changed.

As long as she was still Gu Peiju.

She would hope that the person would trust her.
Gu Peijiu was slightly shocked at the words.

She vaguely remembered seeing Xia Wuyin not long ago...

She inexplicably hoped that this person could believe in her.

"...I see." Gu Peijiu said after a long while.

The conversation had two sides.

After Xia Wushuang was saved by Gu Peijiu, she felt that something was off, but Gu Peijiu managed to deceive her with ease.

Due to her absolute trust in Gu Peijiu and her dislike of using language magic, Xia Wushuang did not notice anything unusual.

It was just that Su Chan had been acting a little strange these past few days.

She would stare at her in the corner with a strange look. Before, when she saw Xia Wushuang, she would run over without a word and pull on her sleeve to take her to play. But now, she didn't say a word.

Xia Wushuang felt a little confused.

"What's wrong with her?"

After Su Chan avoided her for the nth time, Xia Wushuang asked Gu Peijiu curiously.

Gu Peijiu paused and said in a flat voice, "Maybe she's just having a hard time dealing with something."

Xia Wushuang found it interesting. "What kind of trouble could she have in this remote place like Lingxi Peak?"

Gu Peijiu gave her a glance without changing her expression. "Who knows, maybe it's a demon in her heart."

"..."

Xia Wushuang felt that this couldn't go on.

So she found a beautiful day and called Su Chan over.

"What have you been busy with these past few days?" She asked her with a smile.

Su Chan looked at Gu Peijiu behind her, who remained silent, and pursed her lips.
"Why aren't you saying anything?" Xia Wushuang knew that the two of them didn't get along well and looked at Gu Peijiu before turning back to her.

Gu Peijiu remained expressionless.

Suddenly, Su Chan said, "I've been thinking about something these past few days."

Xia Wushuang turned her head to look at Su Chan.

Su Chan said, "Ever since I came from the mortal world, I've had a demon in my heart."

She stared at Xia Wushuang and continued, "At first, I didn't care about it, but it became more and more severe. It got to the point where I couldn't ignore it, and it made me restless day and night, thinking back and forth like a disease."

"It's like being sick."

Xia Wushuang said, "Ah? That's really serious. Do you need me to find a psychologist... no, do you need me to find a doctor who understands this?"

"As long as I figure it out, it'll be okay," Su Chan looked at her, sounding a bit confused, "But I can't figure it out now."

-I can't figure out what you're like.

"I can't figure it out," Xia Wushuang scratched her head and looked at Gu Peijiu behind her.

Gu Peijiu innocently looked at her.

Su Chan's gaze dimmed slightly, and she didn't say anything else. She turned around and was about to leave.

"Hey..." Xia Wushuang turned her head to stop her but didn't know what to say. Su Chan said as she walked away, "I want to be alone for a while."

"Okay then."

After they left, Gu Peijiu said, "She needs to figure it out herself."

"..." Xia Wushuang propped her chin up with her hands and looked outside. "What can I say?"

"I'm not afraid that she won't figure it out. I'm afraid that she'll figure it out but misunderstand it," Gu Peijiu said in confusion.

"Chan is a fallen god, and her personality is naturally a bit paranoid," Xia Wushuang said, "Although she seems to be moving forward properly, once she takes the wrong path... no one can bring her back."

Gu Peijiu fell silent.
As soon as Xia Wushuang closed her mouth, she heard footsteps. Su Chan turned back and asked her a question: "What do you want?"

Xia Wushuang was stunned for a moment, then couldn't help but laugh and cry, "Are you really going to become a god and fulfill my wish?"

Su Chan looked at her.

Xia Wushuang thought for a moment and said cunningly, "I'm not telling you."

Su Chan frowned.

"If you want to know, you can go to the cliff and blow the wind for a while," Xia Wushuang said, "Um... I know you're not in the mood for food, right? I'll tell you when I'm in a better mood after dinner."

Su Chan didn't say anything and turned to leave.

Xia Wushuang regretfully said to Gu Peijiu, "See, she really didn't eat."

Gu Peijiu: "..."

The wind on the cliff was cold.

But the view was vast.

Su Chan sat on the cliff, looking at her hands.

She remembered what she had seen before.

The girl in white clothes, with a crazy smile and cold blood pupils, held a sharp sword in her hand and wielded death and disaster with a wave.

... Disastrous fate.

According to her calculations, once the King of Chu conquered one more small country, he would be able to unify the continent.

But this was not supposed to happen.

The one to unify the continent was not supposed to be the princess of the Chu Kingdom, but a person named Ye, long after.

But everything had happened, and the one who caused all of this was the anomaly Xia Wushuang who defied fate.

So, the heavens put all the punishment and sin on her alone.

Her existence was destined to bring endless blood and violence to the Chu Kingdom.
This is called success and failure both belong to Xiao He.

As a transcendent being, she had a way to save her...

Su Chan lowered her head, her white and delicate palms emitting a faint white light.

A bead slowly floated up from her palm, half of it was snow-white like ice and the other half was pitch-black like the night. The two intertwined and melted into a delicate blood color.

The darkness represents calamity, the snow-white represents blessings and light.

And the blood color in the middle represents her emotions.

This is her soul.

The Pure Spirit Bead.

The soul of a transcendent being possesses the power to suppress evil spirits, otherwise the piece of divine soul that Gu Peijiu placed on the Wenqing Sword would not have suppressed the curse.

When the power of blessing fills this bead, it can wash away all the curses and disasters in the world, including the curse of fate.

But at the same time, it also means...

"Is this place good?"

The voice of a girl sounded.

Su Chan's pupils shrank slightly, and the Pure Spirit Bead in her hand flashed and disappeared. She looked at the undulating mountains in the distance, which were dyed white by the heavy snow a few days ago. They reflected a dazzling and gentle light under the sunlight, very beautiful.

"...It's not bad."

She didn't turn around, just said.

"Are you feeling better now?" Xia Wushuang sat down in a clean place and handed her something, "Here."

The fragrance of osmanthus cake wafted from Xia Ge's palm, and Su Chan's heart trembled slightly as she looked at the crumbs of osmanthus cake on Xia Wushuang's fingertips.

She took the osmanthus cake and took a bite without saying a word.

"They say gods don't eat or drink." Xia Wushuang crossed her legs, "It seems that the legends are all false."

Seeing that Gu Peijiu was not behind Xia Wushuang, Su Chan suddenly felt much more comfortable.
However, she didn't enjoy her peace for long before she remembered Gu Peijiu's words.

"I don't know her, but I won't misunderstand her."

Those words were like a thorn stuck in her heart.

She couldn't sleep or eat properly.

When she came back to her senses, she wanted to refute Xia Ge's words, saying, "I am..."

But she paused, swallowing the words "half-god" back into her throat.

In fact, she hadn't been a half-god for a long time.

During her punishment by the heavens, her human half had long since fallen into darkness and become demonic.

At first, she didn't realize it and even thought she was still half-god and half-human.

But when she saw the wars and Xia Wushuang killing people...

She had no sympathy for humans.

She had no sympathy, no compassion that a half-breed should have.

"What are you?" Xia Wushuang asked with a smile after swallowing her osmanthus cake.

Sue Chan was a little depressed. "Not a lucky little god."

"Haha." Xia Wushuang smiled unconcernedly at Sue Chan's answer. "I've never experienced heart demons and don't know what they are, but... I guess it just means you're in a bad mood."

She looked far away at the overlapping mountains. "But fortunately, when you're in a bad mood, sitting here quietly for a while will make you feel much better."

"Whether it's missing someone, liking someone, or something else."

"Over time, you'll slowly let it go."

Sue Chan stared at her and asked, "What if you can't let it go no matter what?"

"Haha, aren't we talking about heart demons? Why are we talking about letting go again? You got me there," Xia Wushuang laughed. "But I think there's nothing in this world that you can't let go of."

"If you can't let go, it must be because the time is not long enough."
Sulan muttered to herself, "Time, not long enough?"

"You think about it, there must have been a lot of things you couldn't let go of before, you definitely had them! Everyone does! Think about it carefully, oh sorry, I forgot you're not human... oh well, just think about it," said Xia Wushuang.

Sulan began to think.

Although she was not human, there were things she couldn't let go of.

When she was young, she didn't understand the disdainful looks of other gods, but she just wished her father and mother could look at her more.

Later, when she grew up a little, she began to have mortal believers and hoped to do her job well and not disappoint anyone...

...

All were obsessions.

But slowly, things that once seemed important, things that were held tightly in her heart and seemed impossible to let go of, gradually became covered in dust and became insignificant in her life due to the pressures of reality and the passage of time.

... And slowly, she let go.

"Did you have any?" Xia Wushuang asked.

Sulan nodded slightly.

"Do you still care about it now?" Xia Wushuang asked.

Sulan shook her head.

Time is distant, and the regrets and right and wrong of the past are meaningless when revisited.

"You see, things that we couldn't let go of in the past become nothing after a long time," said Xia Wushuang.

As she spoke, she also stirred her own thoughts.

She remembered that when she was a child, she really liked the neighbor's Barbie doll, but her family was poor at the time and she couldn't afford it, so the little Barbie became the white moonlight she couldn't let go of. However, when she grew up and had money to buy a truckload of Barbie dolls and could afford to lose a truckload of them, she suddenly felt that it was not interesting anymore.
There is a time for everything, and when the best time has passed, the things that couldn't be let go of will naturally be slowly released, whether one has inner demons or not. Time is the best weapon. Su Chan stared at the osmanthus cake in her hand. "It's different," she heard herself say. "This one is different. I think I can't let go of this one no matter what." Xia Wushuang said, "Then just sleep on it." Su Chan said, "I can't sleep, I keep tossing and turning." Xia Wushuang said, "Your way of sleeping is different, let me teach you. You just have to think that when you sleep, you can fulfill your wishes in your dreams. Before you sleep, just think that no matter what you want, you will have it when you wake up." Xia Wushuang swallowed the words "Santa Claus can bring it to me" silently. Su Chan said, "...If only it were that easy." "It is, it is," Xia Wushuang babbled for a while before finally getting back to the point. "...Since we're on the topic, what's your inner demon?" "I...have had someone I couldn't let go of for a long time," Su Chan paused and looked into the distance, "and then..." She thought of the blood-eyed girl with the blood-stained sword. Su Chan lowered her eyelashes. She hadn't done what she should have done. "...I feel very uneasy," Su Chan said, abruptly and without context. Xia Wushuang was confused by Su Chan's words, but she understood that Su Chan didn't want to say more, so she didn't force her. "So, that's your inner demon?" Xia Wushuang asked. "Saving her is betraying myself," Su Chan murmured, "but not saving her is betraying my heart." Oh, it's another hero-saving-beauty story.
Xia Wushuang: "...but is there really a difference in the cost?"

Su Chan said, "There is a difference."

She looked out at the mountains, "Because I...am doing well now."

She was no longer a god who blessed the world, nor a demon full of hatred. She was like a person, yet not quite a person.

Because there was someone by her side.

She wanted...to always have this person by her side.

"How did you make your choice?" Xia Wushuang asked.

Su Chan didn't explain what the difference was in the choices, so Xia Wushuang just asked directly.

"Guess," Su Chan smiled.

"Well..." Xia Wushuang thought for a moment and said, "I think you would save her...you would choose the first option, definitely."

Su Chan said, "You're wrong."

"I chose the second option."

Xia Wushuang facepalmed. "Can you not tease me?"

Su Chan laughed, "Why did you think I would choose the first option?"

Xia Wushuang chuckled awkwardly, "Just a gut feeling, haha, I guess it wasn't accurate."

Suddenly, Su Chan asked, "...so what do you want?"

Xia Wushuang was taken aback.

"You said if I came here, you would tell me what you want," Su Chan paused and rephrased, "Or rather, what you can't let go of."

Xia Wushuang didn't say anything and calmly finished her osmanthus cake.

Then she pretended to be sentimental and said, "Of course, I can't let go of this world."

Su Chan: "..."
Xia Wushuang said, "You should just ask me what I want, I can't pretend anymore."

You weren't pretending.

Su Chan thought.

But she still asked, "What do you want?"

Xia Wushuang said, "...I used to want to be with someone, but after a long time, I stopped wanting that."

Su Chan knew who she was talking about.

"Because I let it go...so, there's nothing I want now." Xia Wushuang said, "But it's weird to do nothing, so I just create some value for myself."

She stood up and brushed off the crumbs of osmanthus cake from her hands, "You asked me what I can't let go of, and that's not valuable."

"..."

She reached out to Su Chan.

A breeze blew by.

Su Chan was slightly startled, and also reached out. Xia Wushuang pulled her up and said, "What's important is you."

- What's important is your own thoughts.

She pointed to the towering mountains and steep ridges, as if pointing to a novel world that had never been explored by anyone.

As she looked, she sighed, "Look, how high these mountains are, how beautiful this water is, how vast this continent is."

"The world is so big, why focus on something so narrow? Do you have to live and die for one person?"

Her hand was warm.

Su Chan stared at her in a daze.

Xia Wushuang looked back, her voice clear, "The demon in your heart will eventually be let go."

"Believe me, one day, you won't be trapped by your demons."

"By then, the sea will be wide enough for fish to leap, and the sky high enough for birds to fly!"

(Note: This translation may not be perfect as the provided text lacks context and some phrases may have different interpretations depending on the context.)
Su Chan stared at her blankly. In that moment, the world around her disappeared and it was as if this person was the only thing in her eyes.

She was playful, angry, and lively. With just a few words, she could fill someone's heart with sunshine.

But Xia Wushuang would never know.

In that moment, she became the true demon in Su Chan's heart, something that she could never let go of.
