Chapter 158: Shangri-La

The phrase "Shangri-La" is often used to describe a utopian or idyllic place, and it originates from the novel "Lost Horizon" by British author James Hilton. In the novel, Shangri-La is a hidden valley in the mountains of Tibet, where the inhabitants live long and peaceful lives, free from the troubles of the outside world.

In Chinese culture, the concept of a utopian paradise is also present, and is often referred to as "Shi Wai Tao Yuan" (世外桃源). This phrase literally translates to "Peach Blossom Spring outside the world", and comes from a famous poem by Tao Yuanming, a poet from the Eastern Jin Dynasty.

The poem tells the story of a fisherman who accidentally discovers a hidden paradise, where the people live in harmony with nature and are free from the corruption and chaos of the outside world. The fisherman is welcomed by the inhabitants and stays there for several days, before returning to his own world. He tries to find the paradise again, but is unable to locate it.

The story has become a symbol of a perfect world, and the phrase "Shi Wai Tao Yuan" is often used to describe a place or situation that is ideal and free from the problems of the real world.
