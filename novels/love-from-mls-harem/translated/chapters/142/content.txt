Translation:

The person who could make Ye Ze disregard everything... the person who could stir up his inner hatred.

The answer seemed vague, but upon further thought, it was so obvious.

Xia Ge asked, "Who are you here to kill?"

Ye Ze closed his eyes, as if trying to calm the madness within him. After a moment, he whispered, "Don't worry about it."

Although Xia Ge wasn't sure who the person in the cell was, she knew who he wanted to kill.

The system quietly answered her question, "It's probably Qin Yue."

Xia Ge paused and asked, "Is it worth it?"

Ye Ze didn't say anything.

"Although I don't have much authority to say this," Xia Ge said, "since that person has been caught, and [Zhi] chose to imprison him rather than kill him, there must be a reason..."

Pausing for a moment, Xia Ge tried to persuade him to calm down in a gentle way, "If you kill that person now, you won't be able to escape unscathed..."

"Shut up!" 

As if he had stepped on a sore spot, Ye Ze suddenly turned his head, "Are you trying to stop me too?!"

Xia Ge immediately closed her mouth, put her hands behind her back, and shook her head, "No."

"... "

Seeing him like this, Ye Ze didn't know why, but he suddenly felt more tired.

Looking around at the mess, Xia Ge said, "Anyway, let's leave this place first."

Ye Ze remained silent, but agreed and followed Xia Ge.

The two walked through the thorn forest, and the persimmons in the persimmon forest were ripe, but there were few disciples who came to pick them, so they were all rotten on the ground.

Xia Ge walked carefully and cautiously.

It was already difficult when they came through, and now they had to do it again. It was suffocating.

"I know."
"Ye Ze suddenly said, his voice exhausted. Xia Ge didn't pay attention for a moment and stepped on a rotten persimmon. Xia Ge: "..." It's a mess. "What you said... if you think about it carefully, you will know," Ye Ze did not notice Xia Ge's bad mood after stepping on the rotten persimmon. He leaned on a persimmon tree, feeling powerless, "But... I just don't know... what else can I do besides this..." "... " Xia Ge didn't say anything. His body trembled slightly, and finally covered his gloomy eyes with his hands, "I have no way..." The enemy who wiped out his clan was right there. He couldn't do nothing. "But you killed that person..." Xia Ge didn't know how to say it. He could only say, "It's useless." Before, when Ye Ze went to the Demon Camp for revenge, she thought it was a trap and he was naive. Of course, she is not doing well now, but at least at that time, she could slap him hard and tell him how stupid he was. Moreover, the old man said such things to her a few years ago. Even if he kills that person now, it's useless. The real culprit is the Chang family who wants to get the Skyshine. But now... Ye Ze is obviously still... not strong enough. At least, not strong enough to compete with a family alone. So she can't say anything. She wanted to tell him that he is no different from the one who fell into the trap before. But now, she couldn't say it. "Useless?" Ye Ze asked her back, "Why is it useless?" The old man's words still echoed in his ears.
——"… Don't tell him."

Summer Song tried to smile: "... Let me give you an example that may not sound nice. You see, if a dog bites you, you can't turn around and bite it back."

Ye Ze looked at her for a while.

Suddenly took a step forward and stared at her, "You're hiding something from me."

Summer Song: "..."

Oh my god, is this guy a dog?

"What are you hiding from me?" Ye Ze stared at her, "Why would it be useless if you said I killed her?"

"What can I hide from you?" Summer Song said, "I just think that before everything is clear, you shouldn't be so reckless. If I were you, I..."

"You're not me!" Ye Ze interrupted her, "You don't understand anything!!"

He said word by word, "You have never experienced it, you have never experienced that kind of pain..."

How can a person who has never experienced the pain of a family massacre point fingers at him here?! How can a person without hatred live so freely?!

"I..."

Summer Song suddenly realized that at some point, the relationship between the two of them had slowly developed some inexplicable cracks.

These cracks lay there, silent but growing wider.

Even if she tried to reach out and save it, it was always of little effect, or even useless.

When did it start?

Summer Song didn't know.

"...No, what I mean is, she can't die yet." Summer Song wanted to explain clearly, "You have to wait for the big fish to bite..."

Ye Ze clenched his fists tightly, "Why..."

"Why don't you all want her to die?!" 

Summer Song: "It's not like that..."
Ye Ze looked up at Xia Ge, for a moment feeling as if the world was spinning, as if his anger had clouded his mind. This young man, who was comforting him with his clear and beautiful features, suddenly overlapped with the bell-wearing girl from that night in his eyes.

"You're protecting her..."

Xia Ge sighed helplessly and tried to reason with him, "Don't be like this. I just think we should find out the truth. Some people may have been deceived..."

"Are you pitying her?!"

Xia Ge was taken aback - when did she ever pity that person?

Has this child been kicked by a donkey in the head?

Ye Ze looked at Xia Ge for a moment, then suddenly laughed and murmured, "You pity her, haha, you're pitying her."

"...Who will pity me?"

As he spoke, his eyes slowly turned red, and he squeezed out each word from between his teeth, "Who will pity the two hundred wronged souls of the Ye family who died in vain?!"

He punched a tree and roared, "Xia Wuyin, tell me!"

The tree shook and overripe persimmons fell from it, smashing into a pool of red.

"Fine, I'll tell you!" Xia Ge felt a headache coming on and realized how foolish she was to try to reason with a madman. She should have just punched him in the face from the beginning. Thinking of this, Xia Ge poured out her words, "If I have to say it, it's that you're just too crazy! Do you even have a brain?! You're stupid!! Look at yourself now - Kill, kill, kill. What's the difference between you and those people?! "

She spoke each word clearly, "Just because she destroyed your clan, you want to kill her? Is killing and ignoring everything really what you want?!"

"Then what else can I do? Should I kneel down and thank her for her great kindness?!"

"If you want to thank her for her great kindness, go ahead! If you want to kill her, go ahead! I'm not stopping you!" Xia Ge stabbed him, "The problem is, can you kill her now?"

"Shut up!" Ye Ze said, "I just want her dead!"

"If you have the ability, then go kill her directly! Rules are made for the strong, if you can't win, then you have to kneel down! If you can't win, you still go and fight, if you can't kill her, you still go and try to kill her. Besides your backbone, you have nothing! Oh, wrong, you're also stupid, no, you're just stupid! You're stupid and poisonous!"

"Xia Wuyin, shut up!"

"I won't! You're not only stupid and poisonous, but you're also incredibly selfish! Have you ever thought -"

"I don't want to think! I just want her dead!"

Xia Ge laughed in anger and rolled up her sleeves, "I think you deserve a beating!"
Ye Ze attacked as soon as he went up.

Xia Ge didn't back down and went up to fight. Once the system skill was used against the male lead, it would become ineffective. Fortunately, Ye Ze didn't use his ability either, and the two of them fought fiercely.

Ye Ze had been practicing at Jianfeng every day, so he was incredibly strong. If Xia Ge had fought him before, even with her innate divine power, she wouldn't have been a match for him. However, due to the cleansing of dragon blood, Xia Ge was now stronger than before. Although she appeared weak, she was ruthless when she punched. Each punch was powerful, and as they fought, Ye Ze gradually weakened. With the added strength from the dragon blood, Xia Ge was not tired at all. In the end, she used a small grappling move to throw Ye Ze heavily to the ground!

Xia Ge stepped on him and asked, "Do you surrender?"

"I don't surrender! Go away!" Ye Ze struggled desperately.

"Go away, my ass!" Xia Ge mercilessly pressed him to the ground and sneered, "You can't even beat me——"

Ye Ze was furious, but no matter how hard he struggled, it was all in vain. "Shut up!"

"I won't!" Xia Ge continued to attack and stab him hard, "You can't even take revenge yourself, why blame others?"

"Why don't you go kill her now? Who's going to stop you?"

"You can't even beat me! What right do you have? Just because you have a big mouth?!"

Ye Ze was provoked, his eyes turned red, and he struggled desperately, "Shut up, shut up, shut up——"

"I won't, I won't, I won't——"

In the end, Ye Ze couldn't struggle anymore and gave up. He lay on the ground, his body tense, and seemed to have lost all his strength.

Like a fish that had lost all its resistance.

Xia Ge hesitated for a moment and let go of him.

She had hit him a little too hard just now...

But he deserved it. This guy needed to be taught a lesson, otherwise, he wouldn't know his place.

Xia Ge's body was also a little sore from the fight. This guy really didn't hold back. She gritted her teeth in frustration.

However, the moment she let go, her wrist was suddenly pulled, and the next second, she was pressed hard to the ground!

Xia Ge suddenly widened her eyes and faced the boy's reddened pupils. He held her shoulder with his left hand and pressed his right hand on her pulse!

For a moment, Xia Ge even thought that the person in front of her was someone else.
Ye Ze held her pulse and closed his eyes. When he opened them again, his eyes were calm and indifferent. "Xia Wuyin, you lost."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge suddenly felt a little cold in her heart. She stared at Ye Ze and asked, word by word, "Are you competing with me to win or lose?"

"..." Ye Ze only said, "I won."

Xia Ge said, "You really disappoint me."

"...I have always been disappointing." Ye Ze looked at her quietly. "So, at least once, I want to satisfy myself."

"Xia Wuyin, you are better than me in any way."

"I always want to defeat you every time." 

Ye Ze paused. "Even though I know...I owe you a lot."

The wind gradually became cold.

Xia Ge's voice was a bit harsh. "So what? Are you performing an ungrateful act in front of me?"

Ye Ze said, "No."

Xia Ge asked, "Then what is this?"

"...It's a lesson I'm teaching you as an older brother," Ye Ze said. "You can't slack off at any time."

...Slack off?

Slack off?!

Xia Ge was almost amused by Ye Ze's statement, but when she pulled the corners of her mouth, she found that she couldn't laugh.

"...Because it's you, Ye Ze, my brother who drank with me for three years," Xia Ge said word by word. "That's why I slack off."

"So in the future," Ye Ze said, "it won't be like this."

Xia Ge's face suddenly turned pale.

He gazed at Xia Ge's face.
The young boy's cheeks were soft and angular, his skin fair, and his cat-like eyes bright.

This face was becoming more and more like the face in his nightmares.

"Why aren't you dead yet?" the resemblance was terrifying.

It was so frighteningly similar that it haunted him every night.

He was afraid of reality and did not want to live in falsehood.

The sound of faint footsteps approached.

So... he decided to take this opportunity.

"But, you also taught me something just now." He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, he suddenly smiled, his smile barely visible. "Following the rules is destined to be crushed by them."

"Only by being unconventional can one win."

He slowly tightened his grip on her life force.

A chilling feeling rose from Xia Ge's back as she stared at Ye Ze in a daze. For a moment, the young man in front of her slowly merged with the protagonist in the book she had read before.

In the book, Ye Ze went from innocent and impulsive to gradually becoming stronger, eventually becoming a cold-blooded killer with a cruel smile.

Xia Ge was being choked, murmuring, "I... I can't recognize you anymore, Ye Ze."

The next moment, a red silk attacked! The young man released his grip on Xia Ge and dodged away.

Xia Ge immediately scrambled to her feet, her forehead slightly sweaty. She turned her head and saw Gu Peijiu standing not far away, the heavenly curse thread already back in her right hand, while her left hand held a sword.

"...Senior Sister?" Xia Ge was a little dazed, her life force still hurting. It felt like she was going to die any moment.

Unbelievable.
Gu Peijiu glanced at her and finally stopped her gaze on Ye Ze.

The young man pursed his lips and looked at her.

Gu Peijiu paused for a moment, threw the sword in her hand seemingly casually, and asked Qingqing to draw a cold arc in mid-air. Finally, with a "clang" sound, it was inserted into the persimmon tree trunk behind Ye Ze's right hand. The sword blade hummed and pierced the wood three points, showing great strength.

It seemed like a warning.

In the cold moonlight, the girl looked at Ye Ze, who had just pinched Xia Ge's lifeblood with his right hand. Her pitch-black eyes seemed to flow with a cold glacier.

After a pause, she said indifferently, "Your sword has fallen."
