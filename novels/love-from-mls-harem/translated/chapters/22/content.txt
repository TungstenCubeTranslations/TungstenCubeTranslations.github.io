The scent of sandalwood was cool and refreshing, hitting one's face.

A fallen white porcelain wine cup was held between two slender jade fingers.

The wine in the cup swayed slightly, and the fragrance of peach blossom wine mixed with the cool scent of sandalwood, creating an unbearable taste. Thin and delicate snow-white wrists emerged from the wide red and white sleeves of a maple leaf dress, and the two jade fingers holding the wine cup were even whiter than the white porcelain. The red maple cuffs were exquisite and right in front of her.

The young girl crouched down to pick up the fallen wine cup, then stood up straight with a cold gaze, her red sleeves and maple leaves fluttering like a dream.

Xia Ge raised her head stiffly, from her angle, she could only see the other party's snow-white neck and beautifully curved chin.

Her mind went blank.

...What is this?

Skipping class to play games and getting caught red-handed?!

No, it seems even worse...

The two of them were very close.

The young girl had a cold and ethereal temperament, placing the wine cup she had picked up on the peach wood table. At the moment the white porcelain wine cup touched the peach wood table, Xia Ge met the indifferent black pupils of the young girl.

But there was a hint of shadow in her eyes.

The small tavern, for the sake of elegance, had a small blue porcelain vase with a budding peach blossom placed on the table. This made the person look like a beautiful jade, with fingers as white as scallions.

"...Senior Sister, good evening."

Xia Ge said nervously, "I haven't seen you in a few days, why do you seem to have lost weight..."

Gu Peiju ignored her usual greetings, put down the wine cup and withdrew her hand. The white sleeves and red maple leaves covered her slender hands, leaving only a pair of black pupils staring at her intently.

"Why didn't you come?"

Xia Ge's back was covered in cold sweat.

Damn it, isn't Danfeng's senior disciple busy all day long? Why does she have time to catch an unimportant outer disciple who skipped class?!

You must be really bored!

Suffocating!
She forced a laugh, trying to play dumb. "Ah? What's going on?"

Gu Peijiu didn't fall for her act. With a murderous look in her eyes, she swept a cold glance around the curious, probing, and strange gazes, causing the entire tavern to fall silent from the moment she arrived.

Her voice was gentle. "Suxi."

Xia Ge: "......"

Gu Peijiu's voice was indifferent. "Xia Wuyin, I waited for you at Suxi for three hours."

Xia Ge: "......?"

Xia Ge: "???!!!"

Damn, where were you, my lover? Three hours?! Generally, if someone doesn't show up for an hour - no, if someone doesn't show up after half an hour of waiting, shouldn't you just leave? What kind of nonsense is three hours?!

"...That's really too long...haha, I mean, senior sister might as well sit down, I'll treat you to a drink...as a way of apology?" Xia Ge was bitter, and the gazes of the people around them looked over again, but this time it was particularly intriguing -

Damn it!! What kind of gaze is that, looking at a heartless man?! She's only thirteen years old in this skin!!!

Gu Peijiu looked at her with black pupils like deep stones, neither agreeing nor refusing.

Xia Ge looked at the otherworldly beauty who didn't fit in with the tavern, and her heart was full of bitterness. She sighed, pushing the white porcelain wine glass on the table towards the empty seat opposite her. "Senior sister, I really have to explain this matter - you sit down first, it's a long story, we'll talk slowly?"

Gu Peijiu looked at the young man who skipped class to drink and was caught in the act.

He was dressed in a linen robe like all the outer disciples, and his long black hair was lazily tied up with a light green hairband at the end of his hair. Two strands of black hair hung down on both sides of his cheeks. Before she arrived, this kid had one leg crossed over the other, holding a small wine cup in his right hand, and his left hand was hidden in his sleeve, looking both lazy and content.

After she arrived, he was so scared that he dropped his wine cup. When she picked it up for him, his expression - a little panicked, a little worldly-wise - now he looked at her with a helpless but faint smile in his black, cat-like eyes.

Even if he encountered many unhappy things, even if he put on a bitter face, there was always a smile in his eyes.

Living both worldly-wise and carefree.

So...

Let's hear his explanation.

For some reason, looking at the expressionless senior sister sitting across from her, Xia Ge suddenly had this strange association.

- The cool and arrogant maple leaf fell into her hand.
"Explain."

Gu Peijiu's voice was calm.

Xia Ge: "..."

What associations are not important! What's important now is how to get by cutely!

Xia Ge laughed it off: "Um...how do I put it, if we want to explain this, it's going to be a long story..."

"Cut to the chase."

Looking at the fairy who had descended from the sky and sat down in the tavern without any intention of causing trouble, the tavern gradually became lively, and everyone started to talk and laugh.

The whole tavern was filled with a happy atmosphere.

Xia Ge felt that the air between the two of them was not happy, it was cold, stiff, and difficult to breathe.

It was like the suffocating Siberia in the depths of winter.

"Well, a few days ago, there was an attack by a demonized puppet...in my little house..." Xia Ge intended to tell her senior sister, who was willing to sit down and drink with her, the heartbreaking story of how Tianjiang Reaper had taken away her love and the painful process of selling her glass wood - but she had only just started.

"I know."

The girl's voice was as clear as a spring.

One sentence blocked all the possibilities of Xia Ge's story extending any further.

Xia Ge looked at her in confusion, what do you know?

Do you know that her old and dilapidated little house had half a beam cut off by Tianjiang Reaper, or that she had to run around seeking help from everyone and shed a lot of blood to repair the roof? Or do you know that she used the remaining money to buy a string of sugar-coated haws? Or do you know that she was so poor that she had to drink cheap peach blossom wine from the Mo family village three kilometers away just to have a drink, because she couldn't bear to sell the Reaper and bring bad luck to her home, which also got her caught skipping class! Is there any justice in this world!

System: "..."

The more she thought about it, the more aggrieved she felt...

Just when Xia Ge was feeling frustrated and confused.

Gu Peijiu quietly looked at the young man's left hand hidden in his sleeve, and her voice rang out leisurely, shallow and warm.
"You're injured, I know."
