Chapter 148: A Hippopotamus

In the dense jungle, there was a large hippopotamus slowly walking along the riverbank. Its huge body was covered in thick, dark skin, and its small eyes were constantly scanning the surroundings.

Luo Yu watched the hippopotamus from a distance, his heart pounding with excitement. He had never seen such a large animal before.

He carefully approached the hippopotamus, trying not to startle it. As he got closer, he noticed that the hippopotamus had a wound on its leg. It was bleeding profusely, and the hippopotamus seemed to be in pain.

Luo Yu hesitated for a moment. He knew that hippopotamuses were dangerous animals, and he didn't want to get too close. But he also couldn't bear to see the animal suffer.

Finally, he made a decision. He took out his first aid kit and slowly approached the hippopotamus. The animal didn't seem to notice him at first, but as Luo Yu got closer, it suddenly turned its head and looked at him with its small eyes.

Luo Yu froze for a moment, but then he slowly reached out his hand and touched the hippopotamus's wound. The animal didn't react, and Luo Yu took that as a good sign.

He carefully cleaned the wound and applied some medicine to it. The hippopotamus seemed to be relieved, and it slowly walked away, disappearing into the jungle.

Luo Yu watched it go, feeling a sense of satisfaction. He knew that he had done the right thing, and he was glad that he had been able to help the hippopotamus.
