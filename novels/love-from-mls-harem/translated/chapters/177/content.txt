People were quiet, with all kinds of looks, envy, weirdness, exploration, doubt...

And also passionate.

Chang Nian tightly held the bell, with a fanatical gaze staring at the girl holding Gu Peijiu and wearing a fox mask.

It's her, definitely her!!

The Asking Immortal Bell would ring when the owner's state of mind improved. This person had stepped into the Earth Tier, so her state of mind was naturally high.

Chang Nian suppressed her excitement.

No... she couldn't act rashly. She still didn't know anything yet, she had to wait.

Chang Nian endured for a while, but then a thought emerged. If she was the younger sister... then three years ago, the missing High Priestess of the Demon Cult was her mother...

So she was holding the Senior Brother of Dan Feng...

Chang Nian's heart tightened slightly.

"...May I ask?" 

Someone quietly leaned over and asked Xia Ge, "Is what you have on you... the Town Soul?"

Xia Ge didn't answer, holding Gu Peijiu and walking away on her own.

No one dared to stop her.

Except Ye Ze.

"You can't take her away." Ye Ze stood in front of her, a bit stubborn. "Unless you step over my dead body!"

For a moment, Xia Ge felt like she wanted to vent. There was a devilish fire burning in her heart that she couldn't extinguish.

It seemed that there would always be a day when you would find that everything was terrible. The things you wanted to do would always be hindered, the good things would never be done well, and you would be slandered without a chance to defend yourself. You would bear all the pain and find that it was useless in the end...

All the sadness and pain were because the person who had always loved you was not by your side.

And you knew clearly.

If she wasn't there, no one would stand by your side.
Xia Ge tugged at the corners of her mouth, and a gloomy aura spread out. She smiled and asked in a polite tone, "May I step on your corpse to pass?"

Perhaps she was inherently evil.

And now, she was completely evil.

Lu Qie saw that the situation was not good and immediately grabbed Ye Ze, giving him a signal with her eyes. "Hey, hey, calm down. Um...since we're going the same way, why don't we go together? Haha...this way, it's good for you and me, and everyone else, haha..."

With the ancient clothes and the identity of a ground-level pill master, Lu Qie knew that if they really fought, Lingxi Peak would not benefit. After all, it was more important to win over a ground-level pill master with a town soul than to have a fragile relationship with Lingxi Peak.

The final outcome was probably that a group of people from a certain sect would fly out and attack Ye Ze, and then try to force a favor from him using this relationship.

Such shameless and thick-skinned things had happened before.

However, Ye Ze ignored her signal. His usual gentleness was thrown to the dogs, as if he was looking for a vent to release the oppression and distress in his heart.

This approach was not feasible, so Lu Qie coughed and began to persuade the other side. She whispered to Xia Ge, "Moreover, if...if you and our senior disciple are really close friends...you would surely respect her thoughts, right?"

"Sister...um, I certainly don't want you to be too extreme."

Xia Ge's body stiffened slightly.

Her senior disciple's...thoughts.

After a while, Xia Ge lowered her eyelashes and said, "Okay."

Lu Qie happily tugged at Ye Ze's clothes to make way for him. Ye Ze clenched his fist, said nothing more, and silently stepped aside. People also silently made way for him. With the town soul added, this adventure on the Evil Spirit Mountain, which had caused countless deaths and injuries, seemed to have ended like this.

There were no winners except for death.

Xia Ge took a few steps and suddenly heard a soft, gentle laugh.

"Do you want to save her?"

Xia Ge immediately stopped in her tracks and looked towards the source of the sound!

It was impossible to locate the source of the sound through transmission, and all that could be seen were endless mountains and forests.

However, Xia Ge knew this voice.
Su Chan!

"Your Little Clothes Demon is also in my hands."

"You know what to do."

Su Chan's voice was light and thin, "I'm waiting for you."

Longing!

Xia Ge's footsteps stopped, and she wanted to grit her teeth and reply with "You're dreaming", but in the end, she remained silent and said nothing.

She was exhausted.

"Xia Xia, as long as it's you," Su Chan said softly, "I can wait anytime."

Xia Ge pretended not to hear anything, and for Su Chan's gentle tone, she felt angry, inexplicable, and even insulted.

But she didn't want to delve into any reasons behind it.

She didn't want to hear, see, or know anything about Su Chan.

Not even a little bit.

Su Chan destroyed everything for her.

And she remembered everything clearly.

She couldn't forget any of it.

Although she had advanced a level and comprehended some of the Heavenly Dao, she didn't feel refreshed and energized after advancing, but only deep exhaustion.

After the battle at Evil Spirit Mountain, all sects suffered heavy losses. At the same time, rumors were rampant that Lingxi Danfeng's leader was a puppet master who summoned evil spirits and puppets to harm people, and he was accused of various crimes. The brilliant and talented young man fell into the dust and was severely trampled underfoot.

[Rank] even issued a mainland warrant for Xia Wuyin.

On the other hand, there was a mysterious alchemist who broke through the Earth Level and refined the Ten Thousand Souls Pill. Even if people had never seen her face, they praised her as a flower. They would always remember the magnificent golden light when she refined the Ten Thousand Ghosts into a pill, and her ancient town soul symbolizing supreme glory and power.

Clearly, they were the same person.

One man and one woman.
One person is being stepped on, while the other is being praised to the sky.

Summer Song heard this news three days later and followed the group from Lingxi Peak to protect Gu Peiju and return to Danfeng.

Senior Sister has not woken up, but her breathing is very stable.

She looks like she's just sleeping.

When Bixi saw Gu Peiju like this, she cried in front of everyone, cursing Xia Wuyin for being heartless. After cursing, she cried and said it was impossible.

Summer Song stood aside, unable to say anything.

The crowd sighed and dispersed.

She didn't know how to comfort Bixi, and she felt sad herself.

"Who are you? I never knew Miss had a friend like you." After crying, Bixi wiped her tears and regained her composure, asking her.

Summer Song paused. Bixi was not easy to deceive like the others, and they had been together for a long time, making it easier for her to recognize her. She thought for a moment and said softly, "I'm just a wandering alchemist, not worth mentioning."

"What's your name? You must have a name, right?" Bixi wiped her tears, but her eyes were still red, staring at her as if interrogating a criminal.

As if she had forgotten all the etiquette for receiving guests.

Summer Song probably understood her feelings.

Her Miss went out and came back like this, so if possible, Bixi would ask anyone who could possibly know about the details that might have happened. Etiquette was nothing compared to that - in fact, it was like that.

"I'm called..." Summer Song paused and said softly, "Summer Song."

"Summer? Are you related to that little brat?" After angrily saying this, Bixi felt it wasn't appropriate and took a deep breath. "Sorry, I...got a little excited and was rude."

If she knew that they were not only related by surname, but also by person, she might have picked up a knife and attacked.

Summer Song thought it was funny, but her expression didn't change, and she said softly, "It's okay."

Bixi brought in a basin of hot water with a towel and wanted to wipe her Miss's face. Summer Song took it over and said, "Let me do it."

At this point, Bixi remembered etiquette and quickly refused, "How can I trouble a guest like this? You should..."

"It's okay." Summer Song took the water and said softly, "I owe your Miss a lot, so this is what I should do. You don't have to be polite."
Bixi was slightly stunned and didn't react. By the time she realized it, the towel had already been twisted and was being used to wipe the face of the person lying on the bed.

It was already done, and saying anything more seemed unnecessary. The room was quiet, and outside the window, the frangipani flowers had not yet bloomed.

Xia Ge wondered if the peach blossoms in Su Xi's hometown had bloomed.

"They say the child outside looks like that...I don't believe it at all..." Bixi felt suffocated and had many things she wanted to say, but didn't know who to say them to or what to say.

Finally, she paused, sighed, and said, "I don't know what happened."

Xia Ge's palm brushed against her senior sister's slender eyelashes and rubbed off onto her hand, feeling a bit itchy.

"It's probably just a misunderstanding." Bixi calmed down as her agitated emotions dissipated. She looked at her little mistress, who had closed her eyes, and couldn't help feeling a bit distressed. "It's a shame that our little mistress was so good to him, but he ran away like that when something happened. Even if there was a misunderstanding, it doesn't excuse him!"

Xia Ge: "..."

"Maybe there was never any misunderstanding to begin with," Xia Ge said. "Perhaps she was simply a bad person..."

She paused for a moment.

...Her senior sister wouldn't like her saying that.

She had always taught her to become a gentle and kind person who kept her promises.

After a moment's hesitation, Xia Ge muttered to herself, "She really is a puppeteer."

Bixi looked a bit unhappy. "What's wrong with being a puppeteer? It's not like she's done anything wrong. Our little mistress has known for a long time..."

As she spoke, Bixi seemed to realize something and immediately stopped talking.

At her words, Xia Ge's heart suddenly skipped a beat, then started pounding rapidly. She clenched the towel tightly, trying to act as if nothing was wrong, but her tongue felt a bit bitter.

...So, senior sister, you knew all along, didn't you?

Perhaps she had known three years ago, when she was caught playing the flute in the mountains by her senior sister.

But her senior sister had never said anything, and she had thought she had managed to hide it from her.

She had always thought she had managed to hide it.
Or rather, at that time, she probably already knew that her senior sister might have discovered her identity, but she just didn't want to believe it. And also - looking back now, the reason why she dared to put on such a painfully obvious act in front of her senior sister was simply because she knew that her senior sister wouldn't drive her away.

Because being favored always made her feel invincible.

No matter what her identity was.

Bixi felt like she had talked too much. This person's identity was that of an outsider, and if her words were spread, it would cause a lot of trouble for the senior disciples of Danfeng who knew that their disciple was a puppeteer and did not report it.

"Our young miss has long been dissatisfied with the prohibition of puppeteers in the Fengyue Continent," Bixi continued awkwardly, "After all... puppeteers are still very convenient in some ways. Every profession has its advantages and disadvantages..."

Even Bixi herself felt that her words were far-fetched, and an awkward silence hung in the air.

She changed the subject, "Don't you... take off your mask?"
