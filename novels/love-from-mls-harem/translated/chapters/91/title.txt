Chapter 91: The Road to Revenge 

As the sun began to rise, Liang Wei stood at the edge of the cliff overlooking the valley below. He had spent the entire night contemplating his next move. The death of his father at the hands of the enemy clan had left him with a burning desire for revenge. 

Liang Wei knew that he couldn't take on the enemy clan alone. He needed help, and he knew exactly where to find it. He began his journey towards the nearby village where his childhood friend, Zhang Wei, lived. Zhang Wei was known for his skill with a sword and his unwavering loyalty to his friends. 

As Liang Wei approached the village, he saw Zhang Wei practicing his swordsmanship in a nearby field. Zhang Wei noticed his friend's arrival and rushed over to greet him. Liang Wei explained the situation to Zhang Wei and asked for his help in seeking revenge for his father's death. 

Zhang Wei didn't hesitate to agree. He knew how much Liang Wei loved his father and how much his death had affected him. Together, they began to plan their attack on the enemy clan. They spent weeks studying the clan's movements, weaknesses, and strengths. 

Finally, the day of the attack arrived. Liang Wei and Zhang Wei led a small group of warriors towards the enemy clan's stronghold. They fought fiercely, taking out the guards and making their way towards the leader's chambers. 

As they burst into the room, the leader stood up, ready to fight. Liang Wei and Zhang Wei charged forward, swords drawn. The battle was intense, but in the end, Liang Wei emerged victorious. He had avenged his father's death and fulfilled his duty as a son. 

As Liang Wei and Zhang Wei made their way back to the village, they were greeted with cheers and applause. The villagers had heard of their victory and were proud of their bravery. Liang Wei knew that his father would be proud of him too. He had walked the road to revenge and emerged victorious.
