At her fingertips and knees, there was a clear and tangible feeling just a second ago, but in the next moment, there was a loud "bang", as if a balloon had exploded before her eyes. The person who was supposed to be restrained exploded into a gorgeous flurry of peach blossom petals in front of Xia Ge, and in the next instant, the person disappeared! 

The person had disappeared! 

The soft petals scattered on the ground in pink, as if mocking her helplessness. Xia Ge didn't even get a chance to see the person's face. 

"Who are you?" 

No one answered. 

Everything returned to a dead silence. Xia Ge felt uneasy, and the aura of the Dream Confusion spell became even stronger, but she didn't have the spare energy to use the Awaken spell over and over again. 

"Speak up if you're human or ghost!" Xia Ge paused. "What kind of hero hides behind like a coward!" 

System: "Kidnappers are usually not heroes." 

Xia Ge: "..." Shut up, you talk too much. 

Xia Ge thought about the situation just now - she bit her tongue and was stopped. The person who kidnapped her seemed to not want to see her self-harm. 

Fine. 

Xia Ge stood up, patted the petals off her body, looked around, but couldn't find any sharp objects, not even the fruit plate with winter dates and grapes, which was made of gentle wood. 

Of course, this couldn't stop Xia Ge. She pulled and twisted the Lock God Chain, and wrapped it around her neck! 

"Clatter-" 

The cold chain was grabbed by someone, and the next moment, she was fiercely thrown onto the bed, her hands restrained behind her back! 

She could break free, as long as she wanted to, she could break free! 

But... 

She couldn't move.
不能动弹。

Xia Ge's pupils shrank slightly, not due to the effect of the drug, but...obedience.

"Why hurt yourself?" 

The girl's voice was gentle and soft. "It's not good."

Familiar voice, unfamiliar breath.

It seemed to be the soft voice of a child in a midnight dream.

-"Brother, don't be afraid, I'll protect you."

"Who does Brother think I am?" 

Behind him, the girl's voice was sweet and elegant. "Can you guess?"

His head began to spin again, and the black gauze in front of him swayed as if in a dream.

If it was...what would it be like? No, what else could he do?

"Or..."

The girl's voice was a bit gloomy. "Still can't guess?"

Xia Ge closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them. "I don't know, just give me back my things."

"Oh? Really don't know?" The girl's voice was shallow. "Brother is so smart, I don't believe it."

Is it really "don't know" or did he pretend not to know to leave her some room for maneuver?

Unfortunately, she no longer needed any room for maneuver.

Since she had done it, she had no way to turn back.

Xia Ge said, "If I don't know, I don't know. Why do you talk so much?"

"Really?" 

Very close.

(Translation by AI, might contain errors)
In a blink of an eye, she could see it.

Xia Ge lay on the bed, slightly clenching her fists. She used the "wake-up" function to keep herself calm, but she still didn't turn around. "Don't force me."

"Haha."

The girl chuckled lightly, as if she heard a joke. "Am I forcing you?"

Her weak and boneless arms gently wrapped around Xia Ge's slender waist, and her warm breath teased her ears. "Brother, what you said is not fair."

"Obviously, brother has been forcing me again and again..." The girl's snow-white fingers gently slipped into Xia Ge's clothes. Xia Ge's pupils shrank, and she subconsciously grabbed her wrist. The girl chuckled lightly, but her voice became gloomy. "How can you say that I'm forcing brother?"

Xia Ge remained silent for a long time, and after a while, she said, "Little Butterfly, stop it."

The fragile veil was finally torn off bluntly. The girl sighed lightly and buried her head in Xia Ge's neck, sniffing her scent with deep affection and reminiscence.

"It's been a long time." Chu Yi's voice was charming, but with a hint of malice. "Aze...brother."

Xia Ge's spine slightly stiffened, and the fragrance of the confusing dream was intoxicating. Her brain was a bit confused, as if she had returned to that messy night.

They were discovered by the evil spirits.

She was too weak to protect the child. When the chaotic knife was about to strike, Little Butterfly stood up for her, but was seriously injured because of it.

Taking advantage of the deep night, she used the power of the system in advance and forcibly escaped from the pursuit.

The moon was gentle that night. Little Butterfly, who was injured, woke up with a soft and muddled voice.

"Brother, where are we?"

"On the road."

She carried Little Butterfly on her back and went to the city to find a doctor. The moonlight was bright and the injured Little Butterfly was the first time Xia Ge didn't know whether the road she was taking with Little Butterfly was right or wrong.

"What road?"

She still remembered the large expanse of green reed marshes they passed that night, and the bright moonlight reflecting on the nearby lake, gentle and silent.

"The road of life."

That was the first time she realized it, with an incredibly clear and serious understanding.
She had no way... to protect this child.

Staying by her side would only lead to injury.

Xia Ge was lost in thought, and the confusing dream made it difficult for her to think clearly.

Chu Yi's words sounded like a request, but also like a prayer: "Stay by my side."

His voice even carried... piety.

--Brother, I'll protect you.

What was she thinking at that time?

No...

--You should have endless steamed buns to eat, endless silk to wear. You should have been the princess cherished by the family, willful and carefree, arrogant and capricious. You should have shone like the sun, noble like the moon. Your eyes could see the mountains and rivers that others couldn't see. No matter how you are, it's fine, it's all good. But no matter what...

It's not holding a blood-stained butcher's knife, standing in front of a person haunted by evil spirits, and saying it again and again.

I'll protect you.

And for this, covered in blood, with a disheveled appearance.

"This is wrong."

Xia Ge closed her eyes, the chain in her hand swaying. "Stop it, I..."

Pausing for a moment, her voice became somewhat difficult, "I can still pretend that nothing has happened."

"Stop it?" Chu Yi said, "What kind of joke is brother playing?"

She kissed Xia Ge's neck gently, causing her to tremble, but her next words were icy, "What has happened cannot be undone, no matter what."

"..."

Xia Ge closed her eyes and weakly released the hand that was holding her wrist. The young girl's delicate hand had slowly slipped into her clothes, and their skin was pressed together, causing a slight shiver.

Slowly following the soft curve downwards.

She bit her ear and chuckled, "Brother, aren't you resisting?"
Xia Ge lowered her eyelashes for a moment.

"It's cold," she said.

Chu Yi paused for a moment before pinching a bright red mark onto Xia Ge's snow-white skin with a slight force.

"Is big brother feeling cold in his heart?" Chu Yi's voice was tinged with a hint of mockery. "That's really too bad."

It was unclear whether this sarcasm was directed at Xia Ge's current helplessness or at his own act of seizing power.

"Does it hurt?" 

Xia Ge didn't say anything.

The young girl let out a light sigh and murmured softly, "If only you were mine."

She kissed Xia Ge's earlobe and slowly moved her hand downwards, gently rubbing and pressing. "It doesn't matter if you don't love me, it doesn't matter if you discard me time and time again, I don't care anymore."

"It doesn't hurt."

Xia Ge didn't turn around, but only looked at the fluttering bed curtains, her voice light. "But your hand is very cold."

Chu Yi's pupils slightly contracted.

"Why is it so cold?" Xia Ge suddenly asked. "Is it because you haven't been doing well?"

Xia Ge had been wandering for several years, living a meaningless and aimless life. Ye Ze didn't know Xia Ge was a girl, let alone how to take care of her. Over time, the chill entered her body, and having cold hands and feet was a common occurrence.

But later on...

"What is this?"

"Medicine."

"What kind of medicine?"

"It's for regulating the body."

"I'm not sick, I won't take it."

Even though it had been a long time, Gu Peijiu's voice still echoed in Xia Ge's mind. "But your hands are too cold."
"..."

On that day, the cicadas were lightly chirping, and the girl's voice was soft, "I don't want others to think that you and I are not doing well together."

Xia Ge disagreed, "Having cold hands and feet is a physical problem. What does it have to do with doing well?"

"It doesn't matter," Gu Pei Jiu said, "But I would feel..."

She paused and didn't finish her sentence.

"What do you feel?" Xia Ge pressed on. "Why won't you say it? What do you feel, senior sister?"

"...Cold hands and feet can be regulated," Gu Pei Jiu said. "It's something that can be regulated, but if it's left untreated, how can she do well?"

Xia Ge argued, "Maybe she just doesn't know."

Gu Pei Jiu pushed the dark medicine in her hand towards Xia Ge with an expressionless face. "Well, she knows now. Drink it."

Xia Ge: "..."

Most people with cold hands and feet might just ignore it, but not Chu Yi.

She was the second young miss of the Chu family, living without worries, but her hands were still cold.

Seemingly high and mighty, but in reality... she didn't know warmth or coldness.

- Is she not doing well?

Chu Yi felt her heart trembling. Her cold hand was pressed against her chest, and the warm touch passed through her palm, flowing through her cold blood vessels, and finally carried that warmth from her blood to the deepest part of her heart.

For a moment, she really wanted to dig out this person's heart and see if it was still beating.

Or ask her, or ask that heart, whether it could... still beat for her one more time, even if it was just once.

"...What does it have to do with you whether I'm doing well or not?" Chu Yi heard her own voice, cold and indifferent, unlike herself who always wore a smiling mask. It was like... like a spoiled child tearing open the hypocritical mask, exposing the softest part of her heart, but feeling uneasy about it. Finally, like a hedgehog, she showed the sharpest thorn to the person in her heart, as if this would prevent her from being hurt. "Do you care?"

"..."

Perhaps the fragrance of the confused dream was too deep and strong, making her unable to speak for a moment. In the depths of her distant memory, she only held the hand of this child and walked step by step towards the future and distance that belonged to "Xia Wu Yin" alone. But at that time, the faraway place that belonged to "Xia Wu Yin" was only filled with countless thorns and darkness, without any hope or dawn. In the end, she could only choose to let go of the little butterfly's wings, letting her go with bright eyes to find her own distance.

She cared a lot, very much.
"But the greatest love is learning to let go.

Xia Ge's silence slowly restored Chu Yi's sanity, who was slightly out of control. After a while, she chuckled softly.

She kissed Xia Ge's eyelashes, just like a long time ago when this person comforted her. Chu Yi's voice was soft, "I almost lost control."

"As expected of my brother."

"Forever, forever able to..." Chu Yi's voice gradually became gloomy. She kissed her, her hand slowly moving downwards, the soft mountains, the flat belly, and then...

Trembling.

Chu Yi seemed to feel happy again.

"Are you cold?" Her voice was sweet, "It'll warm up in a bit, brother, don't be afraid."

Her hands were very cold, and she couldn't feel any warmth.

Even though her hands were wandering everywhere, trembling, but there was no heartbeat.

Xia Ge was a little confused, and suddenly didn't know what to do.

...She couldn't do this.

But she couldn't hurt this person either.

Crazy and passionate feelings were like burning, trembling flames. If one was not careful, they would hurt themselves and others.

"Do you love me?" Xia Ge suddenly asked.

"I love you." Chu Yi's voice was extremely certain, even repeating it like a declaration, "I love you."

"No one will love you more than me." She murmured, "I love you... so much it's driving me crazy."

I want to be with you, I want you, I want to look at you day and night, kiss you, touch you--

"So, if I say I'm uncomfortable," Xia Ge said, "will you let me go?"

Chu Yi chuckled softly, "No."

Xia Ge lowered her eyelashes."
This is not love.
