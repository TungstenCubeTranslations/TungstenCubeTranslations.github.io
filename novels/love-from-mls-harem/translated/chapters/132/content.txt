Translation:

Autumn stars flow like fire, a cold poem crafted with a sleepless night;
Under the city that never sleeps, bright lights shine, another year of parting with geese. - Anonymous.

A city without daylight, a night city with eternal lights.
Xia Ge vaguely remembered seeing this city in a book before, and later went to the library to check the books here. She found that the city that never sleeps she had seen in the book did exist in the Wind and Moon Continent, but it was far from the Lingxi Peak, and the teleportation stone was difficult to obtain.

Originally, Xia Ge just remembered this city in a moment of impulse, and didn't have any plans to travel here.

But when she was flipping through the Hundred Cities Chronicle of the Wind and Moon Continent, she suddenly saw this poem at the beginning about the city that never sleeps.

"...another year of parting with geese."

The dust danced in the library, and the warm sunlight shone in. Xia Ge suddenly felt a bit of indescribable melancholy.

Someone was leaving.

This should be a suitable place for farewells.

System: "Do you want to go here?"

Xia Ge pondered deeply, "No, I just feel it's very suitable."

System: "..."

Xia Ge analyzed for it, "You see, if I want to go to Sword Peak, I can only go at night... If I want to drink with someone, the only shops that are open at night in this town are probably the brothels."

System: "Don't talk as if you've never been to a brothel."

Xia Ge coughed, "Uh, I went there just for fun, taking Senior Sister there doesn't seem appropriate... Well, let's not talk about it."

System: "..." How can you say you're going for fun?! What's not appropriate about taking Senior Sister there?!

"Anyway, that was an accident a long, long time ago." Xia Ge changed the subject, "Do you sell teleportation stones to this place?"

System: "Yes."

Xia Ge took out a book called "The Complete Collection of Wind and Moon Poetry," and said seriously, "That's great, I'll write a few scripts and we can perform them tonight."

System: "...What are you going to write?"
Xia Ge: "The captive of the overbearing... no, the overbearing bandit."

Pause.

"And also, a gift for a friend."

The restaurant in the city that never sleeps was adorned with carved railings and painted beams, brightly lit with high-rise buildings. Sitting by the window, one could see the rippling blue waves of the lake in the city, with colorful lanterns reflecting a splendid image in the water. The sound of music and the sweet singing of beautiful women could be heard.

Xia Ge took a sip of wine, the slight sweetness and richness spreading on her tongue. The glutinous rice wine in this restaurant had a unique flavor. She looked up and saw a slender hand holding a jade wine glass, the transparent liquid swaying. The girl was gazing at the boats below, her light brown eyes reflecting the colors of the lanterns, her eyebrows slightly furrowed.

"What are you thinking about?" Xia Ge asked.

Chu Yao withdrew her gaze, holding her chin in one hand as she looked at her. "This boat is very beautiful."

"The boats in the city that never sleeps... Well, they are indeed beautiful," Xia Ge said.

Indeed, they were beautiful and expensive.

Chu Yao took a sip of wine and said casually, "So, it will always receive admiration in this place."

The sweet wine dissolved.

With a hint of bitterness.

Xia Ge said, "Boats are meant to be admired, otherwise why call them boats?"

Chu Yao seemed to be self-deprecating, "But no matter how beautiful it is, it cannot go to the rivers and seas."

Xia Ge blinked, "Big bandit, aren't you talking nonsense? If you let the boat travel to the rivers and seas, what about the ships?"

Chu Yao: "..."

The big bandit Chu Yao didn't seem too happy.

No, the task today was to make the big bandit happy.

Xia Ge came to the rescue, "But, although it's a bit strange... you said the rivers and seas, the boat can still go there."

Â 
Chu Yao looked up at her.

"It's just that walking on a path that doesn't belong to oneself will be a little harder than other ships," Xia Ge finished her pot of wine. She held her chin with both hands, her white and tender cheeks slightly blushing, her cat-like eyes curved as she smiled at her. "But if you make up your mind, that little bit of hardship shouldn't be a big deal, right?"

Chu Yao was slightly startled.

Xia Ge took the opportunity to change the subject: "Great bandit, I want to drink your wine."

The young man had soft features, curved eyebrows and eyes, a slightly drunken flush on his cheeks, and lips that were rosy. His voice was soft and sweet.

Chu Yao inexplicably pushed the white porcelain wine pot in front of her. Just for a moment, she had a strange feeling.

Even if this person asked for the stars in the sky, she would find a way to get them for him.

Xia Ge happily took the wine, filled her empty jade cup, and the sweet and fragrant rice wine spread out. She happily narrowed her eyes, "Great bandit, you're so good, I'm your little captive."

Chu Yao: "..."

Chu Yao suppressed the strange palpitations in her heart and looked away. "You're drunk."

- Just a child who's a bit effeminate.

She thought.

Xia Ge said seriously, "No, I'm not drunk. I really think it's good to be your little captive. We have a boat to watch, songs to listen to, and wine to drink." Xia Ge counted on her fingers, "I'm super poor. If I were a bandit, we would have to use the 11th route to measure how big the city is at night..."

The backpacking route is really different from the luxury route. There are beautiful boats to watch, beautiful women, and you can sell your cuteness and get more wine.

How wonderful.

Xia Ge really felt that being a little captive was great.

Chu Yao: "..." What is the 11th route?

Xia Ge said sincerely, "So, great bandit, can you not leave tomorrow since you're so rich?"

Chu Yao: "..."
Xia Ge's face was expressionless: "Oh, sorry, I got the lines wrong."

"It's not about money! How can such a pure thing as a farewell be tainted with such a coppery smell!"

System: "......"

Chu Yao: "???"

"What I mean is..."

She changed her expression and tried to look serious, counting on her fingers. "Once, twice, three times... including this time, you've treated me to drinks three times."

The young man's white and tender face was slightly intoxicated, but his cat-like eyes were clear and bright. "You always make me so happy every time."

- You always make me so happy every time.

Chu Yao couldn't control her heart from beating faster and faster.

It was like something gently plucking at her heartstrings.

Outside the window, the deep blue night sky had a crescent moon and countless stars.

However, countless stars couldn't compare to the soft light in the young man's smiling eyes.

Those eyes were more beautiful than starlight, the moon, or a boat on a lake at night.

Like two pieces of black cat's eye stones, but even brighter than cat's eye stones.

She fell into those eyes at first sight.

Chu Yao thought dazedly: - His eyes are really beautiful.

"So I think..."

She stood up, one hand supporting the table, the other gently touching the furrowed brow of the young man. On her slender and white wrist, a colorful stone bracelet made a crisp sound as she spoke softly: "Anyway, before you leave, I should make you happy once too."

It was already past midnight.
Outside the window, thousands of fireworks rose up, illuminating the dark night with brilliant colors. The sky was filled with fireworks, and the trees were adorned with silver flowers, creating a beautiful scene.

The people of the city began to cheer.

"Da Qiangdao, if you're not happy," someone said, "there's always next time, or maybe soon. In this city that never sleeps, I'll definitely take you to see it all."

Chu Yao just looked up at her.

---There's nothing that's not happy.

If she had to say something, it was just that in this moment, she suddenly felt a little reluctant.

Clearly... before, she had only felt a little regretful, but upon closer inspection, it didn't matter.

But at this moment.

She felt a little reluctant.

This person, hiding behind her lines, really cared about her, whether she was happy or not.

The wine doesn't intoxicate people; people intoxicate themselves.

She was afraid that she would never wake up from this drunkenness.

"Da Qiangdao," Xia Ge said, "are you happy now?"

The fireworks burst with dazzling colors.

This person was asking her if she was happy.

If she was happy, would there be another time?

If she wasn't happy, would she feel disappointed?

Chu Yao was a little afraid to look into her eyes. She turned her face slightly, her slender, fair hand holding a wine glass, looking out the window at the fireworks that bloomed and fell for a long time.
"...It's okay," she said, and the creases in her brow were slowly smoothed out by the gentle touch of his hand.

The discontent and turmoil in her heart, the confusion and unease, the anger and frustration, all seemed to fade away under the bright, smiling gaze of his eyes.

"Next time," Xia Ge smiled, as if it were only natural, "I'll be the robber."

She didn't need to ask for her opinion anymore.

That's what Chu Yao thought.

There was no expression on her face, but her heart was pounding violently, telling her that this place, this person, this starry night and fireworks at this moment, were all bearing witness to the fact that she had become this child's captive in an instant.

In a moment, the world spun around and the roles were reversed once again.

Without a name, the robber didn't understand, but the captive knew all too well.

You are the robber.

She is the captive.

"Life is like a journey, and I am also a traveler."

Xia Ge smoothed out the furrow in her brow, let go of her hand, returned to his seat, poured her a glass of wine, and seemed to reflect, "In any case, the things that make us sad will always pass."

Chu Yao turned her face away, "What does a child like you know?"

Xia Ge smiled and said nothing.

Wine is sorrow.

The time of drunkenness and the past of heartbreak.
ââ¦â¦é®åä½æä¹ï¼æ°ä¼¼èæ¡¥é£æ¸¡äººãâ
"Hopefully...we won't let down the one who has a heart when we first meet!"

Chu Yao was stunned for a moment.

After a while, she chuckled softly, reached out to rub the young boy's soft hair, and repeated the words in a low voice.

"...won't let down the one who has a heart."

In this world, there are many who are heartless, but few who have a heart.

Therefore, if you meet someone who has a heart, they are even more worthy of being cherished.

The stars outside the window never fall, and under the crescent moon, the little thief slept soundly.
