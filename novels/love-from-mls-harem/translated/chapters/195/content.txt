The eastern sky gradually brightened with a fish belly white hue.

"It's getting light, and I still have some things to do... I had a great chat with Madam," Xia Ge heard her own calm and polite voice, "I'm sorry to have bothered you for so long."

"It's okay," Madam Ye smiled, "you can come and visit often."

Mao Qing said, "I was planning to make something to eat. Would you like to have some here?"

"No," Xia Ge said, "I still have some things to do."

Bai Ren looked at her and suddenly said, "The Ten Thousand Puppet Formation is very dangerous."

Mao Qing and Madam Ye looked at him in confusion.

Bai Ren muttered to himself, "Every disciple who wants to escape... the Leader won't show mercy."

Mao Qing looked at Bai Ren, her lips slightly pursed.

Xia Ge's footsteps paused, and she lowered her brows.

The morning sky was filled with red clouds.

After coming out, Xia Ge went directly to find Su Chan.

Su Chan liked to nest in her main hall.

The spacious hall, the blood-red carpet, and the red-clothed young girl lazily lying on the rocking chair with red fox fur, one hand lazily resting on the book on her body, the other slender and fair hand holding a snow-white pear blossom, raised high, looking at it like a child.

The slender eyelashes cast a deep and shallow shadow on the lower eyelids, and a hint of exhaustion could be seen on her snow-white face.

It seemed silent.

But Su Chan couldn't possibly not hear the slight movements in the breeze.

"I could hear the sound of hurried footsteps from far away," Su Chan let go, and the pear blossom fell softly to her lips, which she gently closed around it. Her red lips and white petals rolled the pear blossom on her tongue, savoring the taste before lazily raising her eyes to look at the uninvited girl in front of her, "Yesterday you complained about blocking your night wind, and today you're here blocking my sun. It's like the officials are allowed to set fires, but the common people can't light lamps."

Su Chan's voice was mournful, like a small and oppressed citizen being bullied by urban management.

Xia Ge: "..." What sun are you sunbathing in this hall?

She looked at Su Chan, who was pretending to be something in front of her, with no expression on her face, "Today, I feel like the entire demonic cult is blocking my way, so I came to find you."
The system couldn't help but speak: "Are you talking about a typhoon?"

"Well, the wind you want to blow is really strong." Su Chan smiled indifferently, covering her face with a book at hand. "Unfortunately, you'll be disappointed. Qianhun Sect is quite sturdy, and no amount of wind can blow it away."

"You're quite sturdy too. You can even sunbathe without the sun." Xia Ge pouted. "If you don't leave, I will. If Qianhun Sect doesn't leave, I will."

Su Chan: "..."

Su Chan took the book off her face and looked at her with a smile that was not really a smile. "Do you want to go out again?"

The pear blossom petals in her mouth suddenly tasted a bit bitter.

Xia Ge asked, "Are you going to stop me?"

Su Chan covered her face with the book again, and her voice sounded indifferent. "How can this seat stop the little priestess?"

Xia Ge turned her head to leave.

Just as she took a step, the door of the main hall slammed shut with a clang. The finely carved portholes around it also closed tightly in an instant, and the spacious hall became pitch black in an instant.

"..." Xia Ge said, "You said you wouldn't stop me."

Su Chan's voice was still lazy, and the sound of her turning pages could even be heard faintly in the dark hall. "I said I can't stop you, but I didn't say I wouldn't stop you."

Xia Ge: "..."

Su Chan asked, "What are you going to do outside?"

Xia Ge stood still and said, "I don't want to stay here."

Su Chan pretended to be sincere and said, "Then go out. I can't stop you."

The godly pressure was released gently, and Blood Stained Spring and Autumn relied on Su Chan's power to act tough in front of Xia Ge. The gap between mortals and demons was like a chasm, making it difficult for Xia Ge to move even an inch. "..."

Damn it.

"Boom!"

In the courtyard, Mao Qing, who had just finished making breakfast, looked confusedly in the direction of the sound. "What sound?"
Blade, who was having breakfast in the courtyard, perked up his sensitive ears and stood up abruptly. "Great Hall!"

Lady Ye, who was not eating or drinking, was confused.

... As for the matter of the young priest angrily tearing down the main hall, the leader of the religion, who was expected to be furious, sent many rare treasures to the sacrificial hall the next day to please the young priest. This embarrassing incident that severely humiliated the bottom layer of the demonic cult is naturally not worth mentioning.

The night grew a little deeper.

The sacrificial hall was where Xia Ge woke up before.

In fact, Su Chan was just trying to scare her, and he controlled his pressure very well, but Xia Ge didn't appreciate it.

Although she destroyed the demonic cult's main hall with the power of the town soul, Xia Ge didn't feel very happy about it.

Actually, there was no need to tell Su Chan about this matter.

She was just unsure if she should go out.

That's right.

She wanted to go out to see her senior sister and also to tell Ye Ze that Lady Ye was still alive.

Of course, it wasn't for Ye Ze, but Lady Ye was indeed a... very good person.

That kind of gentle and noble feeling that came over her and made her feel guilty in front of her.

She was anxious.

Xia Ge looked at her hands.

Fair, slender, gentle and harmless.

But it was these hands that buried everything in the Ye family.

She was unsure if she should do this, unsure if she should tell Ye Ze, unsure if she should reunite mother and son.

She knew that doing so would not benefit her in any way. Ye Ze would not be grateful to her, and Lady Ye, who remembered everything, would...

For no reason, there would be one more person in this world who hates herself.
So she went to find Su Chan.

Because she knew that Su Chan would definitely stop her.

But even though she was successfully stopped, the unease in Xia Ge's heart still surged like waves.

She couldn't convince herself that it was Su Chan who didn't let her go out, not her own choice.

It wasn't...her fault.

It wasn't.

Xia Ge left the sacrificial hall and leaned against the tall doorpost.

"..."

The system, confused, asked, "What's wrong with you? You can escape on your own, why ask her?"

Xia Ge covered her eyes, not letting the glaring sunlight from the sky in, and laughed at herself, "Maybe it's because I love this land so deeply."

The system said, "Don't be so self-deprecating, it's not funny."

Xia Ge had no expression on her face, "You won't die if you laugh."

The system forced a smile, "..."

She slowly moved her hand away.

The sunlight was blinding.

She thought of a long time ago, when she had just joined Dan Feng, her senior sister held her hand and led her to the platform, telling her in front of everyone.

You are the one everyone looks up to.

But now, she was nothing.

No one was leading her forward, and she didn't even know which direction to go.

The next day, Su Chan sent many precious treasures, and the servants were busy carrying boxes into the sacrificial hall.

Because Xia Ge was favored, Qin Yue also happily pampered the little girl she hadn't seen in years, and even gave the entire sacrificial hall to her. Although Xia Ge still felt like she was just a junior priest, in reality, she was only one title away from being a high priest.
In front of the rebellious girl at home, Qin Yue felt naturally indebted and respectful. Even this time, when she came to deliver things, it was her own initiative to volunteer.

"The leader said that these are all treasures from her palace, and there are also some small things she likes," Qin Yue said calmly. "She said she hopes...you will like them."

Xia Ge looked like an honest person: "I don't like them."

Qin Yue glanced at the servant.

Immediately, someone eagerly opened the box.

In an instant, the dazzling jewels filled the room, shining brightly, almost illuminating the entire hall.

The system looked like it had never seen so much money before: "Wow, so much money!!!"

Xia Ge pretended to look away: "..."

Qin Yue said reservedly: "The leader said that if you don't like them, we will take them back. After all, they are bothering the little priest's eyes here..."

Xia Ge immediately turned her head: "Wait!"

Qin Yue smiled at her.

Xia Ge said nonchalantly: "Although I don't really like them, it's not a big deal to reluctantly accept them. The priest's palace...is quite large, and it can fit them."

Actually, she didn't know how big the priest's palace was. After all, she wandered around inside the demonic cult since she arrived here and even got lost.

The poor Xia Ge was just afraid of losing the silver falling from the sky.

Upon hearing this, the system pretended to be sorrowful: "I didn't expect you to be such a shallow person! You've lost face!"

Xia Ge: "..." Get lost.

Qin Yue said, "Oh," and then continued, "The leader also said that if you accept them, she will tell you something..."

"If you tear down her palace, she has nowhere to go, and she will come here to rest tonight."

After Qin Yue finished speaking, Xia Ge saw someone outside carrying a twelve-foot high bed and humming it into the room.
"Pa-"

"Huālālā-"

In an instant, a strong wind rose and all the jewelry boxes flew up in the air. Everyone and everything in the priest's hall were lifted up five or six feet high. Qin Yue quickly flashed out of the hall, avoiding being hit by the flying objects. Others were not so lucky, scattered and rolling out of the priest's hall like ladybugs. Then, with a "clang," the door closed tightly, and Xia Ge's gloomy voice came from inside.

"Let her go."

Qin Yue touched her nose and looked up at Su Chan, who was pretending to look at the stars on the roof of the priest's hall, and said with a bitter smile, "Master..."

Su Chan lazily watched the show and said, "This seat has nowhere to sleep."

His voice was natural and innocent.

With such a large Thousand Soul Sect, are you kidding me?

Qin Yue said expressionlessly, "I heard that you were found in a coffin this time you woke up."

Su Chan: "...No."

==

After losing a huge sum of money, Xia Ge felt depressed.

The system said, "Actually, you can find a way to save the situation..."

Xia Ge retorted, "Shut up, you've ruined my face."

The system: "..."

In the end, Su Chan didn't come to disturb her.

The night was deep, Xia Ge lay in bed, feeling a headache. She covered her head with the soft quilt to make her thoughts less chaotic.

The system sighed, "Still trapped by money and wealth? Mortals."

Xia Ge had a righteous look, "It's not about money."

The system said, "So noble."

Xia Ge shut up.
She really wasn't thinking about money, she was just thinking about a lot of things, like Mao Qing, like her comatose senior sister, and even someone like Su Chan who was hard to like.

She didn't know why, but her thoughts drifted and she remembered a scene from Mo Wu Xu.

In that moment, someone was dressed in white, without a drop of blood on them.

Their voice was hoarse yet gentle.

"The great sin, I will atone for you."

Her heart suddenly skipped a beat.

... Who was that?

She tried hard to remember, but she couldn't recall the person's face.

It was hazy, like a dream.

Xia Ge buried her head in her blanket and grumbled unwillingly, "... What is this? It sounds like I've committed some heinous crime and I need someone to help me atone for it."

She hadn't even killed a chicken before.

The system spoke in a cryptic tone, "Humans are born with sin."

Xia Ge had no expression, "Amen."

The words of Lady Ye seemed to echo again.

"Living day by day, like a walking corpse, I am never truly myself."

Xia Ge suddenly felt very suffocated.

She couldn't sleep no matter what, so she lifted her blanket and got up, wearing simple undergarments. She walked barefoot to the window and opened it, letting the closed window open.

Zhen Hun was hanging by her bed, the black hem of the clothes swaying with the breeze blowing in from outside.

The young girl's mood was suppressed.
There was a moment when the hem of her dress fluttered with a snow-white color, only to be quickly suppressed by the heavy blackness.

Looking at the endless black night sky, Xia Ge felt that her mood had improved a lot.

The system said, "Take a rest."

Xia Ge said, "I suddenly miss home a bit, Xiao Kui. When do you think I can go back?"

The system said, "You're like this again..."

Xia Ge said, "Huh?"

The system said, "...Nothing, I just meant that you're avoiding reality again."

"If you suddenly turned from a well-behaved girl to a fugitive, would you not avoid reality?" Xia Ge rolled her eyes and said somewhat sadly, "If there were food, drink, and fun, who would want to go home and take care of Xia Wuyin, that little brat."

And... Senior Sister.

She lowered her eyelashes.

Even if she could go back, she probably...

If Senior Sister could wake up, that would be great.

The system said, "...Your little brother is quite well-behaved."

Xia Ge perked up, "Now that you mention it, I miss him even more. I wonder if he has a girlfriend yet."

"You haven't talked about that in a long time," the system said. "Hmm... I mean, you haven't mentioned anything about going back there in a while. I thought you had given up."

Xia Ge casually laughed, "Anyway... even if I do have plans to go back, I can't."

The system said, "There must be some hope."

Xia Ge sneered, "Hope is worthless. It's better to have a pile of gold and silver like today."

The system said, "But you still threw it all away."

Xia Ge said, "That's because I regret it now."

The system said, "...Then just think about home."
