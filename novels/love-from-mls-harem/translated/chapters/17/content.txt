Ye Ze had charged in ready to roll up his sleeves and beat up the boy, but upon seeing the blindfolded youth, he froze in place. "You..."

"What's wrong with your eyes?" Xia Ge asked nonchalantly. "They were blinded by the radiance of Sword Peak's Lord Chu," he continued with a grin. "Am I handsome, Xiao Zezi?"

Ye Ze sneered. "Stop talking nonsense. I've never seen someone so ugly."

"It's not right to intrude into someone's home without the owner's permission, Senior Ye," Xia Ge chided.

Ye Ze's sudden door-kicking had Xia Ge feeling both amused and apprehensive. 

Ye Ze scowled. "Xia Wuyin, you have some explaining to do."

Xia Ge sighed and gestured towards the window. "Some brat poked holes in my paper window. The moonlight was too bright, and I couldn't sleep."

Ye Ze saw that the paper window was indeed punctured in several places, allowing the bright moonlight to illuminate the room. 

Xia Ge continued to complain. "I was finally able to settle down and rest, and then you come knocking on my door. And not only that, you break into my home. Senior Ye, I never thought you were that kind of person. Luckily, I'm not a girl. Otherwise, who would compensate me for my innocence?"

Ye Ze remained silent.

Xia Ge continued to plead. "Senior Ye, my senior sister caught me in the mountains the other night, and I had to endure a night of alchemy training. Today, I finally have a chance to sleep. Even if there were sickles on the roof and knives falling from the sky, I would still want to sleep in this room."

"You can go to the next room," Ye Ze suggested.

"I'm attached to this bed," Xia Ge replied blankly.

Ye Ze wanted to bring up the embarrassing incident when Xia Ge had fallen asleep on him before, but he swallowed his words. He didn't want to dwell on the past.

Xia Ge asked, "Can you leave?"

Ye Ze left with a scowl, slamming the door shut behind him.
The sound of the door creaking shut made Xia Ge breathe a sigh of relief and clutch her chest. Finally, she managed to trick that little rascal out of the room. But her relief was short-lived as the voice of the young man outside the door, still tinged with annoyance, interrupted her thoughts.

"Xia Wuyin," he called out. "Don't sleep, I have something to ask you."

Xia Ge rolled her eyes. "Can't you just say it already?"

There was a moment of hesitation before Ye Ze finally spoke up. "Today, during alchemy class, my furnace exploded..."

Xia Ge remained silent, knowing full well that Ye Ze was not gifted in the art of alchemy.

"Xia Wuyin," Ye Ze leaned against the old wooden door and slowly sat down, looking up at the moon. His voice was tinged with exhaustion. "Do you think I'll never achieve my dream in this lifetime?"

Xia Ge shrugged. "Maybe."

Ye Ze gritted his teeth, briefly considering breaking down the door and beating up the shorty surnamed Xia. He then restrained himself and said through gritted teeth, "Xia Wuyin, has anyone ever told you that your words are really infuriating?"

Xia Ge replied nonchalantly, "Don't you say that to me every day?"

Clearly, comforting others was not Xia Ge's strong suit.
Ye Ze: "......"

Feeling really bad, Ye Ze didn't want to argue with this stinky kid, but also didn't want to leave. In the end, he could only fall silent.

Sometimes when a person is feeling down, they just want to be alone for a while. But after a while, they start feeling lonely and want to find someone to comfort them.

Unfortunately, Ye Ze had met the wrong person.

Ye Ze just stayed outside quietly for a while.

Inside, Xia Ge was feeling helpless. The male lead was just squatting outside, which wasn't a solution.

"Xiao Zezi," Xia Ge thought for a moment, "you're doing better than me right now, aren't you?"

Ye Ze moved slightly.

"You have to keep doing better than me for me to call you senior brother," Xia Ge sighed. "Look at you now, I don't even want to recognize you."

Ye Ze: "......"

What can you expect from a dog's mouth?

Ye Ze stood up with a black face. "You better not call me senior brother for the rest of your life."

"Is there breakfast tomorrow?" Xia Ge asked.

Ye Ze sneered, "I won't even feed you to the dogs."

The sound of the boy's footsteps gradually faded away. Xia Ge looked dejected. "Hey, Xiao Gui, am I saying hurtful things?"

The system spoke word by word, "You're trash."

Xia Ge said, "......Don't be like this."

Xia Ge slowly put the puppet away and removed the blindfold. He opened the door directly.

The boy hadn't gone far yet, his slow footsteps filled with confusion and despair.

A distance of one hundred steps... just right.

Between being affected and not being affected, it was just the right distance to capture the soul and seize the spirit.
"Hello."

The stars were scattered and the clear wind blew under the bright moon.

The young man turned around suddenly.

The young man with green hair tied with a yellow cloth in his hand, his eyes were so bright in the moonlight that the color couldn't be seen clearly, only feeling like stars.

"Senior Ye, pearls will gather dust without effort."

"You just made efforts in the wrong direction."

Those were a pair of eyes as bright as stars, with immeasurable power.

"I believe you will become the most dazzling person in the whole Lingxi Peak and fulfill your long-cherished wish!"

Ye Ze was slightly stunned, then came back to his senses and sneered, "A dog's mouth can't spit out ivory...what nonsense."

"Go back to sleep."

The young man with green hair smiled at him, clear and bright like the moon in the sky and as pure as a mountain stream.

Ye Ze paused for a moment, his voice softened.

"By the way, Senior Sister told me...to rest well for two days and go to the Su Xi after three days."

"I know, thanks for passing on the message, Senior Brother!"

"...you brat."

That night, the bright moon, stars, and the clear voice of the young man.

It became a scene that Ye Ze could never forget in his life.

So every time he recalled it, it would be heart-wrenching.

= =

After seeing off Ye Ze, Xia Ge breathed a sigh of relief, closed the door and threw the cloth strip on the table, looking at the window paper that had just been pierced by himself, sighing, "Why am I always the one getting hurt..."

The system wisely didn't respond.
"Never mind, never mind. For the sake of my meal ticket... does that mean I don't have to go to Su Xi tomorrow?"

The system replied, "You never planned on going anyway."

Xia Ge grinned, "Little Puppet knows me well."

The system said, "..."

Xia Ge took the small puppet out of her sleeve.

The crystal-clear puppet was the size of a palm, with long human-like limbs, black stone eyes shining in the moonlight, and delicate black silk hair hanging down on its exquisite shoulders. It gazed quietly at her, as if contemplating itself.

Gentle yet firm.

Looking at the puppet, Xia Ge tilted her head.

...It felt like she was looking at a child.

A child that needed to be loved.

"What a strange feeling," Xia Ge said. "I feel like I'm raising a child..."

The system lazily replied, "It's normal. Puppet masters have a psychic connection with the puppets they make. The puppet will obey your commands absolutely, but in return, it will demand some emotions from you."

"Emotions?" Xia Ge was puzzled. "A puppet?"

Isn't a puppet like a robot, something without emotions?

"It's precisely because puppets don't have emotions that they need someone else's emotions," the system explained.

Xia Ge said, "..." It was a strange logic.

"Generally speaking, the synthesis of puppets will automatically take away emotional points from you and give them to the puppet you create," the system said. "Make sure your emotions can give this little puppet a sense of security, so it won't turn on you."

"Different from the bewitched puppets, once a normal puppet is made by a puppet master, it will trust the puppet master absolutely."

"But you have to give it your emotions, let it know that you won't abandon it, and it will absolutely obey your commands and protect you forever."

"Ah... so every time I make a puppet, I have to invest emotions in them?" Xia Ge asked.

"That's right," the system replied. "But one person's emotions are limited. The top puppet masters turn beans into soldiers, and with a wave of their hand, they have thousands of troops and horses. It's impossible to invest emotions like this in every puppet."
"So, there is a second method."

"A wise puppeteer will invest emotions in one puppet, and then when making the rest of the puppets, use the puppet that needs the owner's 'emotions' as the leader. The rest of the puppets will seek trust and security from the 'leader'."

Xia Ge said, "Ah, it sounds complicated. If the puppet is the leader, then the 'leader' itself has no emotions. How can it command those puppets that need 'emotions'?"

The system said, "That's why all puppeteers in the world want to create a puppet 'leader' with 'emotions'."

Xia Ge said, "Don't change the subject. What are the flaws of this method of making a puppet 'leader'?"

The system said, "The disadvantage of using this method is that once the 'leader' is determined, all puppets made by the puppeteer will absolutely obey the 'leader' and no longer obey the puppeteer's commands. Also, because the 'leader' controls the puppets, it has a high demand for the owner's emotions. A puppeteer must give his 'leader' absolute security, otherwise, the 'leader' will bite back."

"Once the 'leader' bites back, the puppeteer will be in a desperate situation."

"The more 'leaders' the puppeteer controls, the more emotions the owner needs. Therefore, powerful puppeteers can have many puppets under their control, but 'leaders' often have only one."

Xia Ge understood. In other words, the 'leader' was created by the puppeteer for the convenience of managing the puppets. By investing emotions in the 'leader' and manipulating one puppet, the puppeteer could control the puppet army under it. But the wool comes from the sheep, and the puppeteer still has to pay 'emotions' to the puppets.

The system paused, "In my data... five hundred years ago, only one puppeteer made a puppet 'leader' with 'emotions'."

Xia Ge raised her eyebrows slightly, "Oh? That's impressive."

"But... it's terrifying." The system seemed to have lingering fears, "...very...terrifying."

"Hmm?"

The system said, "It was the only puppet that generated its own 'emotions' and 'soul' - it fell in love with its puppeteer."

Xia Ge said, "It sounds a bit like the third-rate romance novel I read before... the legend is called 'The Overbearing Robot Fell in Love with Me'?"

The system said, "..."

The system lowered its voice to emphasize how terrifying it was, "Later, the puppeteer was imprisoned by the 'leader', and until now, five hundred years later, it is still unknown whether he is alive or dead..."

"Oh, it sounds a bit scary." Xia Ge squatted down to look at the puppet on the table, not interested in third-rate romance novels, "Can you move?"

She only liked to read upgrade-flow novels and didn't like overbearing CEOs falling in love with her.

The little glass puppet tilted its small head, blinked its black eyes, and suddenly smiled.

...Cute, so cute!!!
How, how can you be so cute!!

System: "......"

System: "I curse you!"

At least show a "Ah, scary" expression, you jerk!

Such an indifferent attitude! Occasionally, the system also needs a sense of satisfaction!!

After holding back for a while, the system finally came up with a vicious curse, "I curse you to be imprisoned by your own Baidu puppet for five hundred years!"

"If the girl who locks me in the little black room is so cute, five million years wouldn't matter." Xia Ge happily patted the little puppet's head, ignoring the system's flag, "I'm willing to borrow another five hundred years from heaven and be intimate with the girl in the little black room~"

System: "......"

This trash.

"Hey... speaking of which, what's the difference between a demonized puppet and a normal puppet?" Xia Ge reached out to the little puppet, and under the moonlight, the little puppet had a beautiful glass-like color all over its body. It climbed onto her palm and sat there obediently, using its small fingers to comb its own hair.

Xia Ge's heart skipped a beat.

So cute...

This was her first puppet.

= =

Stars were everywhere.

-"...I hope someday..."

-"...how can you be so cruel."

-"...it will hurt, are you willing..."

-"Ah--"

A heart-wrenching scream, as if it could pierce through layers of mist and break through the ages.

Gu Peiju suddenly woke up, cold sweat oozing from her pale forehead. The white moonlight shone through the green gauze, illuminating the delicate white porcelain vase with peach blossoms on the window sill, which looked particularly beautiful.
She sat up, her black silk-like hair soft and hanging over her smooth, snow-white shoulders, accentuating her icy skin and delicate beauty, with a hint of charm.

"Miss, are you okay?" A small child's voice asked delicately at the door.

Gu Peijiu paused for a moment before speaking softly, "What time is it?"

"Miss, it's midnight. Are you..." 

"It's alright," she interrupted the child outside the door, and he fell silent.

Gu Peijiu rubbed her temples and looked at the green gauze curtain, suddenly remembering the green-haired young man she had seen earlier that day.

A handsome young man on the street.

For some reason, Gu Peijiu thought of this sentence, then couldn't help but laugh at herself. Where did the handsome young man come from? He was just a sly little guy with ulterior motives.

But she wondered what his purpose was on Lingxi Peak.

Gu Peijiu put on her clothes and rolled up the green curtain with her delicate hands, letting the gentle moonlight in.

"It's alright."

Lingxi Peak...

The young girl glanced slightly at the neatly folded Danfeng plain clothes on the bed, her black stone-like gaze falling on it.

The exquisite maple leaves shone with a warm light under the moonlight.

As long as this clothes remained here for a day, she would guard Danfeng Peak for a day.

She was the senior disciple of Danfeng Peak, and Danfeng Peak was her future.
