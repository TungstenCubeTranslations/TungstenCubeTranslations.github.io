Xia Ge had a dream at night.

It was pitch black and eerie, with endless black mist permeating the space. There was nothing, no trace of light.

She walked alone in this place with no end in sight, feeling lost and confused.

"...Xiao Kui?" She called out uncertainly, "Xiao Kui, are you there..." there...?

Her words suddenly disappeared, her pupils shrank, and the black mist in front of her dissipated. What appeared before her was an arrow pointing straight at her!

She froze in place, unable to move, and watched as the arrow shot towards her. But in the next moment, it was as if the space had shifted, and the arrow missed her nose by a hair's breadth. She appeared to the side where the arrow was pointing, and heard a "chi" sound.

"Whoosh--"

As if in a play where actors appeared one after another, countless giant bats flashed out of the black mist, and in the next moment, a person dressed in black appeared!

Xia Ge widened her eyes--

"Chi--"

The arrow pierced through the head of the masked person in black, hitting the center of the forehead. Crimson blood slowly seeped out from the forehead, soaking the black face cloth.

The scene repeated itself!

The screeching of the giant bats was deafening, and Xia Ge's heart was beating rapidly. She felt like she was soaked in cold sweat. It was a dream, it was just a dream...

But, she did kill this person.

"How does it feel to kill someone?"

A creepy and eerie voice wrapped around her, with a hint of ruthlessness, "Is it... good?"

"Who?!"

Xia Ge turned her head abruptly, looking back, but all she saw was endless giant bats, with no trace of a person. "Who are you?! Come out!"

"Who am I?"

The voice was eerie and sharp, coming from all directions, with a thick sense of ruthlessness and ridicule, "Who... am I? Don't you know... better than anyone?" 

"Squeak, squeak--"
The text is a passage from a Chinese novel. Here is the translation:

"......Death is actually a very happy thing. People are ignorant, only you and I together... can bring them this kind of happiness."

"Before that... let me bring this happiness to you first."

The voice was alluring and tempting, even though he was saying unreasonable things. It was as if he was singing a poem, making it seem natural. As soon as he finished speaking, countless giant bats rushed towards Xia Ge as if they had received some command!

"Ah -"

Xia Ge suddenly opened her eyes, breathing heavily and wiping the sweat from her forehead.

The darkest hour is just before dawn.

She murmured, "What the hell was he talking about..."

However, in her dream, the feeling of being torn to pieces by bats without any resistance remained with her, as if it had really happened, causing her to shudder.

System: "What's wrong? You woke up so early?"

Xia Ge breathed a sigh, "Yeah."

System: "Did you have a nightmare?"

Xia Ge looked out the window. It was pitch black outside. By this time, her senior sister should have left.

"... I guess it was a nightmare."

She looked away, holding her forehead.

Unnoticed by anyone, the next moment she looked away, a fingernail-sized piece of blood-stained cloth floated lightly from outside the window and landed in the thick grass.

System: "What did you dream about?"

Xia Ge felt tired, "The person I killed before."

System: "It seems that your mental resilience is not good."

Xia Ge smirked, "Isn't it scarier to have good mental resilience in this kind of situation?"

"I am a law-abiding citizen."

But no matter what.
At the moment the feather arrow was released from his hand, it seemed like something had already started to change.

"Are you also going to the Evil Ghost Tide, brother?" 

Chu Yi lifted her eyes and looked at Ye Ze.

Ye Ze responded with a hesitant "yes" and continued, "I have to go."

Chu Yi fell silent for a moment and whispered, "I also want to go with you."

Ye Ze instinctively took a step back, caught off guard. "Chu Shimei, you..."

Chu Yi smiled slightly. "I'm just kidding. Brother's business is at the Sword Peak. There are some things I need to investigate there."

"Last time, Brother asked me who was imprisoned in the Sword Peak's prison." She looked into Ye Ze's eyes, her voice soft. "I've already found out."

"It's..." Ye Ze suddenly interrupted her. "I don't want to hear it."

Chu Yi was taken aback.

"This is my own business. I don't want anyone interfering." The tall and upright youth held his sword and turned his gaze away from her, his lips pursed, his expression vaguely stubborn.

Chu Yi said, "I see."

Ye Ze responded with a "thank you for helping me like this, but..."

"But I like Brother." 

Chu Yi looked at him, her eyes shimmering like the night sky full of stars, tender and gentle. "So, everything about Brother is everything to me."
Ye Ze froze for a moment.

"Brother, you can have my olive branch, my clues, my likes, and everything I have," Chu Yi's voice was shallow, "but brother, you cannot... not have me."

The girl cautiously reached out and grabbed the black corner of the young man's clothes, who had turned his face away.

Under the soft moonlight, a hint of moistness appeared in the girl's almond-shaped eyes.

"If brother doesn't want me..."

"I will die."

Ye Ze was stunned.

"I originally... had nothing," she murmured, "what you gave me, is what I have."

Ye Ze snapped out of it, remained silent for a moment, let go of her hand, took a step back, and said softly.

"I'm glad you like me."

"But, sorry, I can't bear this inexplicable love."

After finishing speaking, Ye Ze turned around and left.

Love is too superficial, and hate is too heavy.

His personal vendetta didn't require another irrelevant person to shoulder it with him.

Everyone is the same.

Chu Yi: "Brother, you are really foolish."

"In this way, when will you be able to take revenge?"

Ye Ze didn't stop.

"Brother can wait, but will the vengeful spirits of the more than two hundred people who died unjustly at the hands of the Ye family, hate brother for his helplessness?"

Ye Ze's footsteps suddenly stopped, his fists clenched, and he stood still.

Chu Yi looked at the moonlit sky and spoke softly, "I heard that they didn't even leave a dog for brother."

(Note: This is a translated excerpt from a Chinese novel, and the names may not be translated accurately.)
"I don't know about your family, brother..." 

Ye Ze's fists clenched, his veins bulging as he turned around and glared at Chu Yi. "Shut up!!" 

Chu Yi closed her mouth and looked at Ye Ze with gentle eyes. 

Ye Ze calmed down and closed his eyes before saying, "You don't need to worry about it." 

He was about to turn and leave when Chu Yi suddenly asked, "Is brother angry?" 

Ye Ze didn't turn around. 

"I made brother angry," she slowly walked towards Ye Ze, "Do you feel angry? Do you feel unreasonable?" 

"I'm really bad." 

Chu Yi smiled, "So, since I'm so bad, brother probably doesn't want to be with me." 

"Then use me." 

Ye Ze said, "Don't follow me." 

"Good people think about whether or not to become partners with someone to share the burden," Chu Yi looked at his back and said to herself, "But I've never been a good person." 

So, she was only fit to be used by others. 

"If someone has to use me," Chu Yi slowly walked up to him and stood shoulder to shoulder, "I want brother to use me." 

"What are you talking about?" Ye Ze said, nonsense... 

His mouth was covered by the tiptoeing girl. Ye Ze was about to struggle, but when he saw what was in the girl's hand, he suddenly stopped. 

In Chu Yi's hand was a bell that looked somewhat familiar. 

Seeing him dazed, Chu Yi shook the bell. The bell moved, but there was no sound. 

It was... Chang Nian's bell. 

"Brother... let me tell you who's in the mountain prison, okay?" Chu Yi's voice was low, "Use me, okay?"
"You use me.

You need me.

That way.

You won't... abandon me again."

Ye Ze looked at the bell, and in the girl's soft murmur, he momentarily returned to that night. The moonlight was gentle, but the only sound in his ears was the howling of the black dog, and the only smell in his nose was the overwhelming scent of blood.

Years had passed, but in his dreams, day and night, his family members were always crying and covered in blood.

Day and night.

"Aze gege." Chu Yi gently wrapped her arms around his neck and whispered in his ear, "Good children don't get candy."

"Even if it's for the innocent souls who have died."

"Gege should also learn to use any means necessary."

= =

Chang Nian's hand touched the spot where the bell used to be for the third time.

It was empty.

Li Liu looked at him strangely, "What's wrong with you?"

Chang Nian calmly withdrew his hand and said, "...nothing."

"Hurry up and eat. Are you too nervous? Hey, I can't tell." Li Liu joked.

Chang Nian glared at him, "Who's nervous? You're talking nonsense!"

Li Liu said, "I heard that our Sword Peak Senior Brother won't be going to the ghost wave this time, but Master Chu will be going. I don't know if it will go smoothly."

Someone next to them asked, "What about Beast Peak and Dan Peak?"

Li Liu recalled, "I saw... the Beast Peak disciple leading some people, and it seems that only one senior disciple from Dan Peak went, and no other disciples participated."

Chang Nian said, "Why is Dan Peak so useless? Don't they have anyone competent?"
A disciple next to them said, "Hmph, without any self-defense ability, even if you go, you will still need someone else's protection. If you're not a Profound-level alchemist, you won't be able to quickly refine the Revitalizing Pill and you'll just be a mess when trying to refine pills there. Going there is just asking for death."

Li Liu pondered and said, "Currently, the Profound-level alchemists in Dan Peak..."

"To reach the Profound-level, one needs a Spiritual Vein and a Pill Vein," the disciple said. "The books on cultivating Pill Veins in Dan Peak were burned hundreds of years ago. Except for the senior disciple who was born with a Pill Vein and can truly refine Profound-level pills, the others who can refine Profound-level pills can only be called 'Pseudo Profound-level' at best."

"Pseudo Profound-level?" Li Liu was curious.

"Tsk, they have opened their Spiritual Vein but because they lack a Pill Vein, the medicinal qi of the pills they refine is insufficient. They can only refine Pseudo Profound-level pills with half the effect. That's what we call Pseudo Profound-level alchemists," the disciple drank some tea and sighed. "Dan Peak's current situation is such that even having a Pseudo Profound-level alchemist is hard to come by."

Li Liu asked, "How do you know so much about this?"

The disciple boasted, "Do you know who I am?"

Chang Nian snorted, "Who?"

"I'm Yao Qian!" The disciple patted his chest. "My father is the famous Yao Wuji!"

Li Liu: "..."

Chang Nian: "..."

Another disciple next to them blurted out, "Ah, your father is the one who sells fake medicine?!"

"Who sells fake medicine?!" Yao Qian stood up and slammed the table. "Who said my father sells fake medicine?! Your whole family sells fake medicine! The pills in our Wuji Medicine Shop are genuine and can cure any illness. Who said it's fake medicine?!"

Yao Qian and the disciple who accused his father of selling fake medicine started quarrelling, making a mess. Chang Nian withdrew her gaze and touched her chest again.

There was still nothing there.

For some reason, she felt restless and upset.

Last night, the voice of the girl in blue was soft.

-"Do you want to know where your sister is?"

-"I can help you."

-"But before that...you also have to help me with something."

Chang Nian remembered and Li Liu casually asked, "What do you have to do?"
Chang Nian asked, "My brother didn't go to the Evil Ghost Tide, right?"

Li Liu smiled and said, "No, both of the senior disciples went. Your brother needs to stay and oversee the situation."

"Okay," Chang Nian said, "I'm going to find my brother."
