The disciples from Jianfeng brought by Chang Lan were still standing outside, seeming hesitant.

Wei Yu said, "Senior Brother, don't believe him. Maybe it's fake, just a cover-up..."

As he spoke, he felt a bit guilty himself. After all, when Xia Ge refined the pill, the master of Danfeng was there to confirm that it was a profound-level pill.

The master of Danfeng might not have a deep understanding of other things, but when it comes to recognizing pills, he was definitely a sharp old ginger who could see through everything at a glance.

Chang Lan glanced at him and he stopped talking.

After a while, a disciple next to them carefully said, "After all, Senior Brother... doesn't have any concrete evidence, this..."

Chang Lan didn't speak, only feeling a strong pain in his temple.

"But he is the most suspicious one!" Wei Yu couldn't help but say.

Suddenly, someone whispered, "But on the day the little puppet was found, Xia Wu Yin was with the senior disciple of Danfeng."

Wei Yu suddenly became tongue-tied. In the end, he impatiently said, "Anyway, there is no one else but him!"

Wei Yu had always looked down on Ye Ze, but Ye Ze had good talent. This time, he was selected to support the Evil Ghost Tide because of his abilities. Wei Yu, who always looked down on others, was instead eliminated. He didn't know how many times he had been ridiculed in secret. He was already hostile towards Xia Wu Yin, who was said to be quite close to Ye Ze. Moreover, many Jianfeng disciples who were friendly with him were injured in the attack by the Demon Cult. They hated the spy even more. They just happened to hear that Xia Wu Yin was the spy of the Demon Cult, so they naturally wanted to catch him and teach him a lesson.

It's just that now this "spy of the Demon Cult" suddenly became the only "savior" of Jianfeng, which made him feel a bit aggrieved no matter how he thought about it.

"Are you... disciples of Jianfeng? What are you doing here?"

While they were arguing, a woman's voice suddenly sounded. Everyone looked over, and Chang Lan was slightly stunned. He knew this woman, "You are... Bixi?"

She was the attendant of the senior disciple of Danfeng.

Bixi frowned, "Are you here to ask for pills?"

Wei Yu spoke straightforwardly, and Chang Lan couldn't stop him, "We are here to catch the spy! Xia Wu Yin is the spy!"

Bixi looked at Chang Lan, raising her eyebrows, "So, you mean that we, the leaders of Danfeng, are spies of the Demon Cult?"

Chang Lan glared at Wei Yu and tried to smooth things over, "There is no evidence yet, and it's not easy to come to a conclusion..."

Bixi said, "Oh? So, do you suspect that we, the leaders of Danfeng, are spies of the Demon Cult?"

Chang Lan: "..."
In fact, that's how it is.

Chang Lan: "This..."

"If you don't have any evidence, please go back and rest. There are still many people with soul poison in Danfeng waiting for the Sect Leader's medicine. If you don't want to seek Dan, then don't make a fuss here." After finishing her words, Bixi paused and looked at Chang Lan, her voice faintly mocking, "What does the eldest senior brother think?"

Chang Lan: "..."

Wei Yu wanted to say something but was glared at by Chang Lan. The glare was very cold, making Wei Yu shiver and unable to say a word.

Chang Lan looked at Bixi, remained silent for a while, and said, "Let's go first."

Bixi smiled insincerely, "No need to see you off."

Inside the room, Mao Qing took the medicine and opened her eyes to look at Xia Ge.

Xia Ge: "Why are you looking at me? Do you feel uncomfortable?"

Although this soul poison was not severe for Mao Qing, being affected by the toxin, some confusing things were inevitable. The medicine melted in her mouth, and a shallow scent of medicine spread between her lips and teeth. A cool feeling dispersed, completely burying the discomfort, leaving only delicate and gentle comfort, driving away the toxins invading her soul.

Mao Qing smiled slightly, "I'm not uncomfortable."

After a pause, she said, "That's good."

"Okay then." Xia Ge said, "Rest well, you should be all better after a good sleep."

Mao Qing made a sound of agreement and closed her eyes.

It was already late at night. Xia Ge stretched and lay on the table, ignoring the noise outside and preparing to rest.

Just as Xia Ge was about to fall asleep, she suddenly heard Mao Qing's voice again.

"Xia Wuyin."

Xia Ge was very sleepy, and her head was a little dizzy, "Hmm?"

"Can I ask you a question?"

"...Ask."

She was a little confused.
"When you save someone, what does it feel like?" 

Mao Qing's voice was somewhat light and airy. 

Xia Ge: "....hmm?" 

After a while, when Mao Qing realized what she was asking, she scratched her head. "This question..." 

Xia Ge thought for a moment. "If you save someone you want to save, you will feel very fulfilled." 

Mao Qing looked at her. 

Xia Ge smiled at her. "If you're asking me what it feels like to save you, give me half of the candy in your pocket and I'll reluctantly tell you." 

Mao Qing silently looked at her for a while, then turned over and closed her eyes, facing away from her. 

"Say it or not." 

Xia Ge: "...." 

It seems like the Soul Pill is working? 

Although a bit annoying, Mao Qing is speaking like her normal self. 

Xia Ge's doubts in her heart dissipated slightly, and she smiled. "Hey, don't be like this. It's just a few pieces of candy. Why be so stingy?" 

Mao Qing: "I'm poor." 

Xia Ge: "...." 

Xia Ge: "Okay, I'll tell you." 

Mao Qing cautiously turned back and looked at her. 

Her long eyelashes and pupils reflected Xia Ge's shadow. 

Xia Ge said deeply, "If I have to say, the feeling is... 

"I'm really amazing." 

Mao Qing: "...."
System: "......"

Xia Ge: "Am I not amazing?"

Mao Qing was silent for a moment before dryly responding, "Haha, you're really amazing."

After speaking, she silently pulled up the covers, turned around, and left Xia Ge with her back facing her.

Xia Ge: "......"

She suspiciously asked the system, "Am I not amazing?"

System: "As long as you're happy."

To be honest, when it comes to something like thick skin, sometimes you can't even tell if it's thick or thin anymore...

The room was silent, not even an echo could be heard.

Mao Qing seemed to have fallen asleep.

It was already late at night, and it seemed like the noisy group of Jianfeng disciples outside had been driven out by their master to continue their training.

A bright moon shone outside the window, and inside the room, there was only silence.

If she had to say something...

Xia Ge lay on the table, and after a long time, she spoke softly.

"To be honest...I don't think I've let you down. It's really...great."

The moonlight was beautiful.

Mao Qing, with her back facing Xia Ge, fluttered her long eyelashes slightly.

= =

It was as if they had traveled through ancient times.

Something wet seemed to be dripping onto their faces.
Gu Peijiu slowly woke up to the sight of stalactites of all shapes and sizes above her, towering high and emitting eerie lights. Small droplets of water fell from the stalactites, making a "plop" sound as they landed in small puddles on the ground. The sound of water droplets continued endlessly, adding a touch of abruptness to the silence.

After a moment of hesitation, Gu Peijiu got up and looked around. She found herself in a stalactite forest, with faint lights visible at both ends, suggesting a path leading somewhere.

Recalling everything that had happened before, Gu Peijiu didn't hesitate and casually took out a yellow talisman paper with nothing on it. She chose a direction and started walking.

After only a few steps, a somewhat eerie voice sounded, "Do you know where you are?"

The voice echoed from all directions, accompanied by the sound of dripping water, making it even more terrifying.

Gu Peijiu didn't look around or answer. She casually threw the empty talisman paper out, and in the blink of an eye, the talisman paper burst into a bright flame, leaving several sharp marks on the paper. Finally, it seemed to hit something and stuck in the empty space. Immediately, the air started to twist, and everything around her began to change, including the dripping stalactites, the cave, and the puddles.

The yellow talisman paper trembled for a moment, carrying something with it. With a "sizzle" sound, it burst into flames, and everything around her twisted and disappeared like a burnt rag. In its place was a bamboo forest that seemed to stretch on endlessly.

The sound of the wind rustling through the bamboo forest could be heard.

The yellow talisman paper burned out, and the thing it carried fell down dejectedly. Gu Peijiu reached out and caught it. It was a fingernail-sized piece of blood-stained cloth, with dried blood that had been burnt black by the talisman paper, but not completely destroyed.

Gu Peijiu's eyes turned cold, and in the next moment, flames ignited in her palm.

With a "sizzle" sound, the small piece of blood-stained cloth suddenly expanded and flew towards Gu Peijiu aggressively.

"Chi!"

The Tianzhu silk moved with the wind, its silk-like blades tearing the cloth into countless pieces!

The eerie voice sounded again, with anger at being exposed, "I wonder how long you can hold on!"

After a while, the voice laughed eerily, "Anyway, you can't guess where you are..."

The torn white cloth slowly disappeared, and the wind blew through the bamboo leaves, creating a rustling sound.

It was a bamboo forest, with a blue sky and light clouds.
Gu Peijiu put away the Heavenly Punishing Silk, her sleeves slightly damp as if she had just returned from a trip to a stalactite forest.

It felt so real.

Looking up at the azure sky, Gu Peijiu pondered with narrowed eyes.

She felt like she had seen this bamboo forest somewhere before.

As if a long, long time ago, she had seen it somewhere.

The wind rustled softly.

"Oh my god..."

Just as Gu Peijiu was lost in thought, she suddenly heard a familiar yet somewhat unfamiliar female voice coming from the bamboo forest.

"Why can't I find it... can't find it..."

The crisp voice was tinged with a hint of distress.

The voice grew closer and closer, and Gu Peijiu hid herself while readying the Heavenly Punishing Silk. The bamboo forest rustled softly, and the next moment, the girl who was speaking appeared in Gu Peijiu's sight. She was carrying a bamboo basket on her back, with fair skin and cat-like eyes that showed a hint of distress. She held a wooden stick in her hand, poking around in the weeds on the ground as if searching for something.

Gu Peijiu looked at the face and silently clenched the Heavenly Punishing Silk.

Is this an illusion?

But it didn't seem quite like it.

In the illusion of the stalactite forest just now, she could find the place where the illusion was broken with the Broken Illusion Talisman. But here... there was nothing unusual.

But if it wasn't an illusion, why was Xia Wuyin here?

And this scene...

"Ah! Found it!"

The girl jumped for joy as she pulled out a dull-colored mushroom from a clump of weeds and threw it into her basket. A look of unusual satisfaction appeared on her face.

Just as Gu Peijiu was lost in thought, the girl suddenly turned her head and exclaimed in surprise, "Ajie, weren't you looking for mushrooms? Why are you still here?"
