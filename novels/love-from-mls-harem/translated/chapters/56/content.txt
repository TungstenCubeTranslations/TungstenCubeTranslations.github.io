Xia Ge felt that she was facing the biggest crisis since she crossed over to this world.

To make a long story short, she couldn't say a word.

As someone who could become the senior sister of a peak master, she certainly wasn't easy to fool. If she said something wrong, she would be in big trouble.

Gu Peiju said, "If it doesn't hurt anymore, speak up."

"Ah... my head suddenly hurts again."

Xia Ge covered her head and whimpered, "What's going on? My head suddenly started hurting... Ah, it hurts so much."

Gu Peiju remained silent, looking at her expressionlessly.

As the sun set, the girl's face looked particularly stern.

After howling dryly for two minutes, the other party remained unmoved, and Xia Ge couldn't continue acting.

Finally, her shoulders drooped, and she hung her head in despair. "Can't you show a little bit of sympathy for your disciple who is in excruciating pain from his injuries?"

"Heh." Show sympathy?

Not showing sympathy for oneself, but expecting others to show sympathy?

This laugh was inexplicable, but it carried a strong chill.

The air around them became freezing.

Xia Ge laughed awkwardly, suddenly afraid to look into the other party's eyes.

Really... if you don't want to show sympathy, then don't. Why make the atmosphere so tense...

After a while, the voice on the other side spoke in a cold tone, "Speak."

Hey, this tone is so cold that it's dropping ice chips.

Xia Ge tried to get the maximum benefit for herself, "If I tell you... can you return my things to me?"

Xia Ge cautiously stroked the tiger's whiskers, "That, the dragon jade with a missing corner..."

The dragon jade that fell on the back mountain and was missing a corner.
"So, you admit that you went to the back mountain?" 

Gu Peiju's lips tightened.

Seeing the other party not responding, Xia Ge bluffed, "If I don't have that jade, my ancestral grave will emit green smoke. I mean, that's my family's inherited dragon jade. If my ancestors are missing it, they will come to talk to me about life in the middle of the night!"

"Wuwuwu, even if you don't kill me, I won't say it!"

Gu Peiju looked at Xia Ge and said in a calm voice, "You don't have to say it."

She stood up, and the red maple robe fluttered in the wind. Xia Ge, with sharp eyes, saw the dried and blotchy bloodstains on her exquisite red clothes.

It was sudden and unnatural.

"Hey, wait a minute--"

Xia Ge grabbed her sleeve and muttered softly, "You're so stingy... you don't need that jade anyway..."

The young girl had delicate eyebrows and eyes, tightly pursed lips, and a chill all over her body, making her look very unapproachable. She looked at Xia Ge without saying a word.

But the chill around her was even stronger.

Oops... did she anger her?

Xia Ge was a bit at a loss. Ye Ze was okay, but this little conservative master sister, who was young and held the power of life and death, really made her feel helpless.

Just as Xia Ge was pulling her sleeve and racking her brain to figure out how to end the situation, she heard the other party speak, "Just now, you lied."

Not a single word was true.

Xia Ge: "..."

After a while, Xia Ge, under Gu Peiju's icy gaze, awkwardly said, "Although the dragon jade is not inherited... it is still important... what I mean is, it's as important as the inherited one..."

Gu Peiju calmly stated, "A headache is also a lie."

Xia Ge: "..."

Yes, yes, everything is a lie! Everything is a lie!

It's okay as long as everyone understands, right?
"Do we really have to say it and nail her to the shame column of lies?"

"It's tough not to break the truth, senior sister!"

Under the cold gaze of the other person, Xia Ge struggled to speak, "Anyway, it doesn't hurt now."

The other person didn't say anything for a long time.

Xia Ge cautiously raised her head to look at her, but only saw the girl in the red and white maple dress looking out the window with pursed lips.

Uh...she seems really angry...

And the bloodstains on her clothes...

After a while, Xia Ge heard her own low voice, "Um...I'm sorry."

Gu Peijiu didn't say anything.

Xia Ge looked up at her dark eyes and spoke somewhat unnaturally, "At that time... was it you?"

On the Dan training ground.

The person who took her away.

Soft sandalwood, warm embrace.

-"You should rest."

Gu Peijiu withdrew her gaze from the window and scanned the somewhat unnatural expression on the boy's face, slowly moving downwards, finally resting on the hand that was pulling her sleeve.

A slender and fair left hand, she could hold it gently with a single grip.

It looked very weak.

But in the palm of the hand, there was a scar that was left for someone else.

After a while, she sat back and said in a faint voice, "Speak, I'm listening."

As for Xia Ge's question, she neither admitted nor denied it.

Xia Ge struggled for a while, but then thought about it. Since senior sister had already taken the jade pendant, she couldn't hide the matter of going to the back mountain anyway...
Allowing her to think of a more reasonable explanation...

However, before Xia Ge could come up with anything, Gu Peijiu's voice sounded casually, "How did you get the wound on your stomach?"

Xia Ge jumped in surprise, "Ah, I bumped into something!"

Gu Peijiu looked at her expressionlessly.

Xia Ge stuttered, "I mean...I accidentally hit a knife."

Gu Peijiu coldly eyed her, "You hit yourself?"

Xia Ge remained silent, finding this question too difficult to answer.

Gu Peijiu paused for a moment and decided to give Xia Ge another chance, "What about the whip marks on your back?"

Well, that's another difficult question. But the marks on her back were not from a whip...

...Never mind, compared to the punishment for trespassing into the ancestral tomb and the punishment for being caught by the puppets in the back mountain, the latter seemed to be lighter, right?

Xia Ge opened her eyes wide and lied, "Um, that...I was caught by the puppets in the back mountain and they whipped me."

Gu Peijiu quietly looked at her for a while.

Xia Ge tried hard to make her smile look more genuine.

Gu Peijiu finished looking at her, stood up, and was about to leave.

Her sleeve was caught again, as expected.

Gu Peijiu's voice was calm, "If you don't tell the truth, why should I stay?"

Xia Ge felt guilty, "I...I told the truth."

Gu Peijiu said, "The guardians in the back mountain have no weapons."
After a pause, "They won't have whips to beat you with, or daggers to stab you with."

Xia Ge still held onto her sleeve, unwilling to let go. "Hey, I just happened to run into one with those things, it's just bad luck."

Gu Peijiu said sternly, "Xia Wuyin."

"Here," Xia Ge replied.

"Danfeng's disciples rely on trustworthiness to establish themselves," Gu Peijiu pursed her lips and slowly pulled her sleeve away from Xia Ge's hand. "I don't expect you to be honest and trustworthy in everything, but at least..."

The cool sleeve was gently pulled away from her hand by the girl. The silk was soft and smooth. "When you can truly trust me, then we can talk about it."

Outside the window, the sun had completely set, taking with it the last bit of brightness from the day. In the dark sky, stars had begun to twinkle with their faint light.

The sound of the door being pulled open creaked, and the girl in red left her room.

"Xiao Kui, are you awake? Has my trust with my senior sister been completely lost?" Xia Ge shouted, but there was no response.

"...Forget it," she thought, "why bother asking? It must have been lost."

In fact, this situation of shouting without a response occasionally occurred. It could last as long as a day or as short as half a day, but it didn't have much impact. Xia Ge just assumed it was still asleep and wasn't too worried.

Xia Ge looked at herself, her bandages were neatly wrapped, her chest was bound properly, and it seemed that her senior sister didn't suspect anything.

It was really lucky.

The person had left, and the system still hadn't awakened. Xia Ge had nothing to do, so she looked around the room that was arranged for her to recover in.

It wasn't luxurious, but it was clean and tidy. There was an octagonal frame in the corner, the carved window hung with a green curtain that had been hooked up, and on the pearwood table in front of the window, there was a complete set of writing tools, with a small white porcelain vase in the corner, holding a few stalks of fan grass.

Although simple, there was an elegant and tranquil atmosphere.

The faint smell of sandalwood lingered around, and no matter how she looked at it, it didn't seem like a room for casually placing disciples to recover in, but rather...like a young lady's boudoir.

Stop!

It couldn't be, right...

Xia Ge was a little afraid to think further. She coughed and looked over at the small table next to the bed, where scrolls were neatly placed. Xia Ge observed them and found that they were indeed very neat.
Every page was perfect, with not a single mistake, the kind of neatness that could cure all OCD. Staring at the perfectly placed vermilion pen, Xia Ge thought, this wasn't just a desk.

It was a work of art.

But to make such a small table look like this, Senior Sister must have OCD, right?

Xia Ge stared at the topmost "Final Evaluation of the Danfeng Competition," thinking.

Sigh, the more OCD one has, the easier it is to be rigid in thinking. Judging by the looks of it, if she doesn't tell the truth, she probably...

But with all these injuries, it's hard to get away with lying.

But before that, should she sneak a peek at her score?

It'll be known sooner or later anyway, and it's not cheating if she finds out ahead of time!

Just a little... peek!

Xia Ge was about to stretch out her paw towards "Final Evaluation of the Danfeng Competition" when suddenly the wooden door creaked openâ€”

Xia Ge quickly withdrew her paw, but because of her sudden movement, she pulled on her wound and winced in pain. She looked up and saw a stranger, a woman in a blue dress, carrying a basin of water. The woman had an oval face, big eyes, pursed lips, and black hair tied up simply. She looked at Xia Ge with a not-so-pleasant expression.

Xia Ge gritted her teeth in pain and said awkwardly, "You're quite unfamiliar to me, miss."

"I am Miss's maid," the woman said. "My name is Bixi."

Bixi introduced herself and looked at Xia Ge, but her expression remained unpleasant.

"Bixi, you're so beautiful," Xia Ge flattered. "Danfeng is blessed with beautiful women."

Bixi put the water down heavily and snorted, "You talk sweet, but your heart is not pure."

Xia Ge: "..."

Ah, it seems like she flattered the wrong person.

"Miss sent me to take care of you," Bixi said. "As soon as you can move, move out of Miss's room."

Xia Ge nodded repeatedly, "Okay, okay, no problem... huh?!"

Xia Ge suddenly came to her senses and stared in disbelief, "Where is this?"
Bixi's face turned even uglier. "Who cares where we are? We're leaving tomorrow! Hurry up and go!"

Xia Ge hesitated. This information was a bit overwhelming for her to digest.

"What do you mean...Miss's room? Which Miss? Not the Miss she's thinking of, right?"

Bixi's expression was blank. "The one who just left."

Xia Ge: "..." Wow, was she still dreaming? Ouch, her head hurt. Maybe she should go back to sleep. It seemed like she was still in a dream...

But Bixi didn't care what Xia Ge was thinking. The thought of this guy fainting and holding onto Miss made her feel angry. She glared at Xia Wuyin and twisted the towel in the basin fiercely, as if she was using it to vent her anger towards him. She used so much force that Xia Ge, who felt like she was still dreaming, silently shrunk into the corner.

Although it felt like a dream, it was really terrifying.

Finally, Bixi couldn't hold it in anymore. She threw the twisted towel back into the basin with force. Xia Ge watched as the towel that had just been wrung out became soaked again in an instant. For a moment, she didn't know whether she felt sorry for Bixi's arm strength or for herself, who was about to face Bixi's anger.

Bixi stood with her arms akimbo and pointed at Xia Ge's nose. "Speak! Were you pretending to sleep earlier?"

If Xia Ge's movements weren't restricted due to her injury, she would have raised her hands and feet to prove her innocence. "No! I wasn't!"

Why would she pretend to sleep? She didn't even know if she had won the competition or not. What was the point of that? She must still be dreaming, right?

"Pah! You held onto my Miss's hand for two days, causing her clothes to come undone and having to take care of you for two days!" Bixi was so angry that she couldn't help but remember how her precious Miss had never taken care of anyone since arriving at Danfeng. If it weren't for this guy holding onto her, Miss wouldn't have paid any attention to him!

"You were pretending to sleep to take advantage of my Miss!"

Xia Ge: "!!!" What?!
