Fear.

But Su Chan just smiled and didn't move.

The sect master was angry at being ignored. With a tap of her cane, a violent wave spread out. A fine black space crack opened up, centered on her and extending to the distance between her and Xia Ge, threatening to tear them apart!

Su Chan didn't even look at it. She just gazed into Xia Ge's eyes, her long and thick eyelashes trembling slightly. Then she lowered her head and lightly kissed Xia Ge's forehead.

Xia Ge's pupils suddenly shrank!

"I can give you anything," she sighed softly. "Even my life."

"Whoever hurts you, I will make her suffer for the rest of her life."

The next moment!

The crack in the space suddenly rebounded. The circular space dissipated just as it was about to touch Xia Ge, and the terrifying space cracks actually turned around and rushed towards the sect master!

The sect master shuddered, spitting out a mouthful of blood!

"Who are you?" The sect master leaned on her cane with one hand and covered her chest with the other, her lips trembling. "Introduce yourself!"

As a ground-level advanced space magician, she had never encountered an opponent on the entire continent, except for the reclusive legendary gods!

Su Chan completely ignored the sect master and just looked at Xia Ge, laughing softly, "Only I can bully you."

Xia Ge trembled slightly all over, then reached out and slapped her!

"Get out of here!"

Her palm stung, and Xia Ge trembled all over. "Get out of here!"

She had caused her so much harm - she couldn't even be with Xia Ge anymore. From now on, she had to bear the name of Qin Shuang or Xia Wuyin, and she would be reviled by the world. She hadn't done anything wrong, but she had to suffer such humiliation!

Why could this person still laugh like this?!!

Why could she still smile at her like this?!

The slap hurt, and blood overflowed from Su Chan's lips, but her smile didn't change. She licked her lips like a blooming amaryllis, extremely enchanting.

"Why are you so angry?"
She gently stroked her cheek, and beneath her long eyelashes, a pair of black eyes faintly glowed with a seductive red. She sighed softly, "I just did what I had to do."

"Your identity is that of a priestess of the Demon Cult. The Demon Cult is the only place you should be."

"This is your bloodline, and also your destiny."

"Why be angry?" 

"I'm not!" Xia Ge said.

"Damn destiny!!" 

Xia Ge only believed in herself, not destiny!

"Well, okay, you're not," Su Chan even indulged her a little, gently hugging her, "you are yourself."

Xia Ge looked at Su Chan with wide eyes, as if she were looking at a monster.

How could there be such a ridiculous and absurd person in this world?

Who was she?

Feeling Xia Ge's trembling and overheated body, she gently soothed her like a spoiled child, her voice tender and gentle.

Xia Ge instinctively wanted to push her away, but the soft whispers in her ear made her freeze.

It was like someone had touched a nerve.

"But whoever you are, you would still hope that person could be behind you."

It was like being caught by a venomous snake.

Xia Ge was speechless.

Feeling Xia Ge's silence, Su Chan knew she was obedient.

She turned around and looked at the head of the sect, a faint smile appearing on her lips. She tilted her head and looked at the old man, "Do you want me to introduce myself?"

The head of the sect couldn't say a word.

No one else noticed.
But she felt it.

That kind of...pressure that she had never felt before in her life.

Like that of a high-ranking god...

Lofty and aloof.

"I am..." Su Chan reached out, her slender fingertips tracing the snow-white skin of the young girl, slowly moving from her neck to her chin, following the curve of her cheeks, and finally lightly brushing her slightly raised eyebrow and forehead.

As if she were looking at a child she had spoiled for a long time.

"Xia Xia's guardian deity."

In an instant, Mao Qing's illusion faded away, and the young girl in a red coat stood out against her fair skin, like a heavenly goddess descending to earth, yet also like a fiery red lotus, her beauty almost blinding to the eye.

- Whoever makes you hurt, I will make them hurt a thousand times, ten thousand times more.

Likewise.

If anyone falls in love with you.

Then she will make sure they have no resting place in death.

Her followers can only love her alone.

Su Chan hugged Xia Ge. "Are you cold?"

Xia Ge's body was icy cold, a cold that could be felt even through her clothes.

The bright red blood stained the spring and autumn, intertwining with the dark soul of the town, looking harmonious yet eerie.

Cold, very cold.

Chilled to the bone.

"Come with me, and no one will dare to bully you again." Her voice was soft and gentle. "Was I too much?"

"I won't bully you anymore."

"If you feel angry, just bully them back."


"Don't be afraid, Xia Xia."

With blood staining the spring and autumn seasons, accompanied by divine power and suppressing the Tianzhu Ling, the Tianzhu Ling that lost its master's control wrapped around Xia Ge's wrist, firmly gripping it. However, with no control from Gu Peijiu, one person could not fight against four hands, and eventually, it slowly slipped from Xia Ge's weak hand under the tyranny of blood staining the spring and autumn seasons.

Xia Ge didn't notice, and a violent storm centered around her, with immense pressure weighing down on everyone. No one dared to say a word about what was happening.

Xia Ge moved her lips instinctively, wanting to refuse, but the power of the Zhentian on her Xuan-level body was not as strong as the momentum of the ancient clothes demon blood staining the spring and autumn seasons on her true master. She was slowly assimilated, and a warm feeling arose, and everything in front of her began to blur.

"You won't refuse," the girl's voice was soft, "if Xia Xia is smart, she'll come with me."

Xia Ge heard her own hoarse voice, "I..." No.

"I know Xia Xia isn't a smart child," Su Chan sighed softly, speaking slowly, "but you should try to be a little smarter for the person you like."

She hugged Xia Ge, her chin resting on her shoulder, a very intimate and affectionate appearance - she could clearly see Gu Peijiu behind the girl.

Her voice was gentle, but her eyes were as cold as needles.

She thought of the kiss Xia Ge had given to Gu Peijiu before.

... Really jealous.

So jealous.

Telling Ye Ze the truth and directing his gaze towards the Chang family was not just because she didn't want to see Xia Ge sad and lost.

She had known that Xia Ge would secretly go see Gu Peijiu.

So she had Ye Ze prepare in advance.

Her deal with Ye Ze... was for this moment.

Her Xia Xia, desperate and at a loss, in this moment.

No matter if she hated her, was disgusted with her, or didn't want to have any involvement with her, in this moment without Gu Peijiu, she was her only way.

Even if she was rebellious, Xia Xia would eventually compromise for Gu Peijiu.

People are all the same.
Seeking and fearing.

The seven emotions and six desires, love, hate, affection, and enmity.

The only regret is that Xia Xia's desire is not her.

But it doesn't matter.

As long as she is in this world, it's okay.

She has waited too long.

Even if she acts impulsively and recklessly, it doesn't matter.

It's been too long.

Anyway, someday...

"Xia Xia, come with me."

The girl hugged Xia Ge, gently held his cold hand, her long eyelashes trembling slightly, her voice soft, but her smile was proud and cold as she looked at Gu Peiju who was sleeping behind Xia Ge.

Gu Peiju.

Separated by a hundred years, even if you try your best and take the first step, you are still the loser.

Even though the matter of the Evil Spirit Mountain has been talked about a lot, when the news reached Chang'an, it had been a long time.

Chu Yi held the Meteor Dagger in her hand, black and sharp. The gentle sunshine came in through the open paper window, but it couldn't reach the corner where she was.

She was wearing a water-colored dress with layered lotus patterns, finely embroidered with delicate stitches. However, there were a few dead butterfly leaves on the exquisitely beautiful lotus flowers. The girl was not wearing shoes, and her white toes shyly revealed a little under the water skirt. Even though she was in a dark corner, her skin was as white as if it were glowing. The clothes scattered on the ground accentuated her slender and graceful figure. She gently touched the dagger, her almond eyes unfocused.

Her world was dark.

Not long after, a white dove flew over, with a letter tied to its foot. It landed on the windowsill and peered inside.

The girl flipped the dagger in her hand, and in the next moment, the black dagger pierced through the white dove's neck. The dove didn't even have a chance to scream, and blood splattered on the spot.
"…Young Master, please calm down." A deep male voice sounded from outside the window, low and muffled, somewhat ethereal, as if coming from a faraway place.

It was the message carried by the pigeon's foot.

Chu Yi remained silent.

"There is news from the Evil Spirit Mountain," the male voice hesitated for a moment, "related to the one at the Lingxi Peak. Do you want to hear it?"

Chu Yi raised her hand in silence, and the shooting star dagger that had killed the pigeon was quickly brought back by the little butterflies, falling into the girl's hand.

Drop by drop, the bright red blood dripped from the dagger, leaving marks on the girl's light blue skirt. One drop fell on the pure white twisted lotus, spreading deep and shallow shades of red.

"The pigeon is dead," the girl's eyes were empty, her voice weak.

"The butterflies are dead too."

The male voice was a little confused for a while, "…Please clarify, Young Master."

The sharp blade was pointed at her own chest, and the familiar yet unfamiliar smell of blood filled the air.

Chu Yi's voice was somewhat indifferent.

"Why can't my heart die?"

The male voice dared not speak.

"Speak up."

At this, the male voice slowly revealed the news.

The leader of the Lingxi Dan Peak had harmed her fellow disciples, colluded with the demonic sect, disguised herself as a man for more than ten years, and called upon evil spirits to refine the Wan Hun Dan, all in order to break through the Earth-level realm, disregarding the lives and deaths of others...

Rumors and slanders, all kinds of defamatory names, overnight, that brilliant and talented genius disappeared without a trace and became a stranger that no one had ever heard of in people's gossip.

The male voice reported cautiously.

Chu Yi asked, "Who are you talking about?"

The male voice hesitated for a moment, thinking that the Young Master had not heard clearly, and repeated, "...Xia, the leader of the Lingxi Dan Peak."
"..."

"She's now in collusion with the Demon Cult... I heard she has a private relationship with the Demon Cult leader... and according to the news from the Hundred Ghosts Cave..."

The male voice also mentioned the entanglement between Xia Ge and Ye Ze.

"Shut up." Chu Yi suddenly spoke.

His voice was low.

The male voice immediately shut his mouth.

Life is like a play.

This play of my brother's is particularly exciting.

The surroundings became quiet.

The young girl's pupils were lifeless, but she maintained a posture of looking out the window. In her pale hand was a blood-stained black dagger. Her slender figure was complemented by the overlapping and dyed blue clothes. The blood drops on the dagger had already dripped off, but she didn't care at all.

There was a time when she also hoped for this, hoping that her brother would fall from grace, hoping that he would fall into the mortal world, hoping that she would be despised by everyone, hoping that she wouldn't like anyone other than her brother...

Therefore, she deliberately let Ye Ze see Qin Yue, and tried to separate their relationship, even thinking about locking her up...

At that time, she thought that she would love her and accompany her brother to the end.

But now.

She felt very painful.

It turned out that seeing the person she liked being insulted by others, and the person she loved being trampled in the mud was this kind of feeling.

- She shouldn't be like this.

She wanted to pull her up.

Very painful.

Every word this person said about her brother was like a needle, piercing her heart, making her feel uncomfortable.

She even felt angry.
She hadn't felt angry for a long time.
