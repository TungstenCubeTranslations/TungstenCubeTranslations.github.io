Chapter 152: Storm is Coming

The sky was dark and gloomy, and the wind was howling. The leaves on the trees rustled and swayed, as if they were dancing to the rhythm of the wind. The air was filled with the smell of rain, and the sound of thunder could be heard in the distance.

Zhang Wei looked up at the sky and frowned. He knew that a storm was coming, and it was going to be a big one. He quickly gathered his things and headed back to his apartment.

As he walked, he saw people rushing to get home before the storm hit. The streets were crowded with cars, and the honking of horns filled the air. Zhang Wei quickened his pace, trying to avoid the rush.

When he finally reached his apartment, he was drenched in sweat. He quickly locked the door behind him and went to the window to watch the storm. The rain was coming down in sheets, and the wind was blowing so hard that it was bending the trees.

Zhang Wei sat down on his couch and sighed. He knew that he was lucky to be safe and dry inside his apartment. He thought about all the people who were still outside, trying to find shelter from the storm.

He decided to call his friends and family to make sure they were safe. He knew that it was going to be a long night, and he wanted to make sure that everyone he cared about was okay.
