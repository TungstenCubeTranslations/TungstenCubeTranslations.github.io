Everything in the dream gradually became blurred and dissipated.

Tiny droplets of water dripped onto her face, and the dampness made her feel very uncomfortable.

Xia Ge slowly opened her eyes to a pitch-black darkness.

The beautiful scenery in her dream had turned into a bubble, and the cruelty of reality hit her.

Xia Ge felt a headache coming on. She groped around for a while and felt the uneven and slippery stone wall next to her. She grabbed a protruding rock and struggled to stand up, feeling a little dizzy.

She had lost some of her soul power in her dream, but it had mostly returned. However, she still felt a faint pain from overexertion. Everything became clearer to her. She had been sucked into the Bai Meng acupoint by Bai Meng, and before that, she had thrown Mao Qing out...

Mao Qing... she should be okay, right?

"Little puppet?"

Xia Ge called out to the system, but there was no response except for the sound of dripping water in the damp cave.

Xia Ge didn't care and took out her sickle from the Flowing Silver Ring. However, she used too much force, and when the sickle was pulled out, two pieces of sakura candy that Xia Ge had hidden inside fell out with a rustling sound.

The sound of the candy wrapper falling to the ground was very light.

Xia Ge: "..."

The Flowing Silver Ring was indeed a faulty ring... had she just thought of eating candy?

Xia Ge bent down to pick up the candy and lazily put it in her pocket. She didn't bother putting it back in the ring. Who knows, when she reached into her pocket, she found something different.

It was folded rice paper.

Xia Ge's mind went blank for a moment before she remembered that it was the painting of the Bai Meng acupoint that Mao Qing had drawn. She had planned to give it to her after finishing the task, but before she could, she was sucked into the real Bai Meng acupoint.

Looking at the pitch-black Bai Meng acupoint and thinking about Mao Qing's description of the misty clouds in her dream, Xia Ge sighed.

"...Dreams really do deceive people."

Xia Ge opened the rice paper, but in the darkness, she couldn't see what was painted on it. However, the beautiful scenery of the Bai Meng acupoint that Mao Qing had painted in the daytime at the Su Xi Dan Pavilion was completely different from the reality of the upside-down bats and damp cave. Compared to the scenery in the painting, the reality was even more absurd.

She had originally had a bit of longing for the Bai Meng acupoint.

But now...
Whether she was obsessed with dragons or not, one thing was for sure, she was feeling down. Xia Ge put away her painting, holding a sickle in one hand and feeling her way along the uneven stone wall with the other, slowly moving forward. Occasionally, she disturbed a few hanging green-eyed bats, and with a "chirp chirp" and a flutter of wings towards her face, even if some were invisible, she instinctively swung her sickle and basically hit everything accurately. Stepping on the dead bat bodies, she didn't walk far before her eyes gradually adjusted to the darkness. Xia Ge walked and pondered about her dream just now. They say that people have thoughts during the day and dreams at night, and dreams are just a combination of images from reality. However, in reality, she had never been to any bamboo forest nor seen such a pretty little girl in red. Wait a minute. Xia Ge's footsteps paused slightly, she looked up at the slowly dripping stones above her head. The pretty little girl in her dream, what did she look like again? She couldn't remember. All she could remember was the lush bamboo forest, the blue sky, the mushrooms hidden in the bamboo shoots, and the little girl's crimson dress. "...Why did I dream of a child?" Xia Ge rubbed her temples. "Shouldn't I have dreamt of a handsome guy?" Even if she couldn't dream of a handsome guy, she shouldn't dream of a little girl younger than her. Was she born to be a laborer who takes care of people? Walking aimlessly while thinking, the stones under her feet were also uneven and bumpy, and she used her sickle to support herself as she walked, paying attention to her feet. The originally narrow cave also slowly became wider as she walked. It might be an illusion, but Xia Ge always felt that the further she went, the brighter it became. However, after only a few steps, Xia Ge's steps suddenly stopped. She slightly tightened the sickle in her hand, staring intently at a protruding rock not far away. That rock didn't seem to be any different from the others, except that it had a silver butterfly with half a broken wing, emitting a faint glow, perched on it. Xia Ge: "..."
She instinctively touched the painting in her pocket.

... So there really was a butterfly in the Bai Meng Cave.

Although it was a bit uglier than she had imagined.

The Silver Butterfly seemed to have lost all its strength, lying on a rock on the verge of death.

Even though Xia Ge was in the supposedly dangerous Bai Meng Cave, she didn't dare to let her guard down too much, holding onto her sickle and cautiously approaching.

Even when she got close enough to grab the butterfly with just one hand, there was no movement.

... It was safe.

As she got closer, she realized that the butterfly looked familiar.

... It wasn't just a little familiar.

Xia Ge crouched down, her sickle resting on her shoulder, and reached out to touch the butterfly's wings.

The Silver Butterfly trembled slightly, and her fingertips pierced through the butterfly. It was only then that Xia Ge realized that the butterfly was just a thin illusion.

But she had already recognized what it was.

The butterfly she had killed in her senior sister's hot spring that day seemed to be just like this one.

"... No way?"

Xia Ge murmured to herself, "It can't be her, can it?"

... It must not be her, definitely not her.

Just pretend she doesn't exist.

However, fate played a joke on her.

When Xia Ge crossed the narrow stone cave and came to a spacious stone pool, she still saw the person she didn't want to see now, no matter what.

It wasn't that she hated this person and didn't want to see her.

It was just that she didn't want to see her in a place like the Bai Meng Cave.
If I had to describe my mood, it would be like coming home from grocery shopping one day and finding out that the son you've been raising for over a decade is at an internet cafe.

That feeling of wanting to grab his ears and scold him for not being more diligent...yeah.

Of course, even though Chu Yi isn't Xia Ge's son that he's been raising for over a decade, and Bai Meng Xue isn't just any old internet cafe, she still can't grab their ears and scold them.

This is a relatively spacious "stone hall," not as narrow and low as a stone cave. When you look up, you can see the criss-crossing stone pillars on the "ceiling" several meters high. In the middle of the "stone hall" is a large irregular stone pool filled with green liquid that emits a faint glow and bubbles, giving off an ominous feeling. Xia Ge can't estimate how big the stone hall is, but it seems to be connected to several other stone caves like the one he just walked out of.

Chu Yi leans quietly against one of the stone caves, her eyes closed, her clothes and hair slightly damp. Several silver butterflies fly around her, their light somewhat dim. Xia Ge notices that her aura seems to be suppressed, flickering on and off.

Xia Ge stands in front of the stone cave, hesitating whether to go in or not.

Little Puppet hasn't woken up yet, and Xia Ge realizes he doesn't even have anyone to consult with.

"Save a person to the end and send them to the west..."

"But people have to be independent...you can't always help her."

"But if you just leave, you'll definitely regret it."

"..."

After some internal struggle, Xia Ge sighs and remembers Chu Yi's attitude towards "Xia Wu Yin" earlier. He doesn't know if it's guilt or something else, but she silently takes out a handkerchief from her ring and covers her face with it before slowly walking over.

His footsteps pause slightly.

Whether it's an illusion or not, as soon as Xia Ge steps out of the stone cave, he feels like something is watching him.

A deep, cold gaze filled with a hint of killing intent.

Xia Ge pauses for a moment, then continues to walk over to Chu Yi as if nothing is wrong.

She seems to be unconscious.

Under her long eyelashes are a pair of beautiful black eyes, a delicate and slightly immature face, illuminated by the green glow from the stone pool, making her look fragile.

Xia Ge looks at her face and forgets about the potential danger that may exist here. For a moment, he seems to be transported back to those years.

The little girl with blood-stained white cloth covering her eyes, who was so hungry she could barely stand, but coldly and stubbornly refused his help.

The injured eyes that couldn't even cry.
However, at that time, she was only a five or six-year-old child.

Thin and small.

Xia Ge couldn't figure out what could be so cruel as to blind a child's eyes and let her wander the streets.

Xia Ge also couldn't remember where she, a beggar who hadn't eaten in days, found the compassion to take in this blind and stubborn Chu Yi.

Those times passed like flowing water. Coming back to reality from her memories, Xia Ge sighed and pushed Chu Yi.

Indeed, she couldn't just sit idly by.

"Wake up, hey, wake up." Xia Ge pushed Chu Yi. "The sun is baking your butt."

No response.

Xia Ge: "..."

Okay.

Xia Ge had innate strength and Chu Yi was light, so Xia Ge easily lifted her up. She looked around and saw that the stone pool was deep and secluded, with a sense of foreboding in the air. The surrounding stone caves were interconnected, and for a moment, it was difficult to tell which one was the exit.

"...My luck should be...pretty good?" Xia Ge muttered to herself. "...I should be able to find the way by wandering around?"

The gaze on her back suddenly became even more intense!

Just as Xia Ge was about to walk towards a cave, a sudden and violent sound of water erupted, accompanied by a fierce and deafening roar!

"Roar -"

In an instant, the wind howled and water spurted into the sky!

Xia Ge was carrying Chu Yi and didn't have time to turn around. The greenish-blue water splashed onto Chu Yi's body, but Xia Ge managed to block most of it.

Xia Ge: "..." This was really unexpected.

When she turned around, her eyes suddenly widened. This was a huge...dragon?!

Xia Ge had never eaten pork, but she had seen pigs running.

In other words, although she had never seen what a real dragon looked like, based on some descriptions in books, it wasn't much different.
The body of this Jiao is covered in fine scales, with deer antlers growing from its head, a long neck like a snake, and two front claws tightly clenched. Its body is sturdy, with protruding crocodile teeth and angry, round eyes. Even the ceiling several meters high cannot support its huge size, and it stares fiercely at Xia Ge, panting heavily with a ferocious look in its eyes.

The feeling of being watched like a sharp blade made Xia Ge instinctively assess the enemy's attributes.

【Green Jiao: a hidden Jiao that is only one step away from transforming into a dragon. It is trapped in Chen Yuan forever due to the fall of the gods and the heavenly ban.

Level: You cannot defeat it.

Attributes: You cannot defeat it.

Other: There is nothing else. You definitely cannot defeat it.】

Xia Ge: "......"

Are you kidding me with these attributes?!!

Little Puppet wakes up: "It's not a joke, it's just that the level is too high to detect."

Xia Ge: "......" Are you trying to poison me?
