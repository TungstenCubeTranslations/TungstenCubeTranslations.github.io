Morning class.

As Mao Qing predicted, Huo Bai had already left.

Xia Ge flipped through the alchemy book, feeling uneasy.

The book recorded the methods of refining various yellow-grade and some mysterious-grade elixirs. Because the methods of refining mysterious-grade elixirs were not lost, the alchemists of Dan Peak could only reach the level of pseudo-mysterious grade due to the lost methods of cultivating the elixir veins.

As she turned the pages, the moment when the arrow flew out of her hand flashed through her mind involuntarily.

-"You can't escape."

The eerie voice seemed to be laughing somewhere in her dream.

"Snap!"

Xia Ge closed the book abruptly, closed her eyes, and felt a little scared for some reason.

System: "What's wrong with you?"

Xia Ge came back to her senses: "Nothing, just reading, just reading."

-"Prepare well for the mid-term exam."

Her senior sister said that to her.

So she would prepare well for the exam.

The content of the book was not boring, with many mysterious-grade elixirs.

"[Baihun Pill]: A middle-grade mysterious elixir used to relieve soul poison. {Attached with elixir formula}." Xia Ge turned the page and found densely packed elixir formulas on the back.

Xia Ge glanced at them and fell into deep thought, "...Will the mid-term exam include the test of mysterious-grade elixirs?"

System: "How would I know."

That was true.

Xia Ge looked at the quiet master reading in front of her, made sure he wasn't paying attention to her, and raised the book to cover her face, then looked at Mao Qing.
Mao Qing was reading a book when Xia Ge glanced over.

The first page of the Dan Book.

Xia Ge greeted her with a smile, "Good morning Mao Qing, have you eaten yet?"

Mao Qing paused her reading for a moment, then turned to look at Xia Ge.

The girl had long, slender eyelashes and her black pupils reflected Xia Ge's smile, as well as a row of fine shadows.

Xia Ge skillfully took out a piece of sakura candy from her pocket and handed it to her, "I have a question for you."

Mao Qing lowered her head and looked at the candy in her hand, then looked back at Xia Ge, "What is it?"

"Do you think they won't test for Xuan-level pills in the mid-term exam this year?" Xia Ge pointed to the Hundred Soul Pill in the book and guessed, "I think it's possible they won't, but it's in the book, so I can't rule out the possibility of the teacher having a momentary lapse of reason... Hey, you read more than I do, what do you think?"

Mao Qing paused and lightly traced her fingertip over the page, "Probably, they will test for it."

Xia Ge was distressed, "Huh? Probably? Are you not sure?"

This book probably will be tested on, right?

Just as she finished thinking, she heard Mao Qing innocently say, "It's just a guess. If we're guessing, then this book is also possible."

You really do make a lot of sense, just like what she was thinking.

So why did she even ask you?

Xia Ge silently reached out her hand to her, "..."

Mao Qing: "???"

Xia Ge: "Give me my candy back."

Mao Qing: "..."

System: "..." Stop it, you two.

The candy in her palm still carried warmth.
Mao Qing said, "It will be tested."

Xia Ge squinted at her, "Huh?"

Mao Qing blinked, "This, it will be tested."

Xia Ge said, "You just said..."

Mao Qing smiled slightly, a little arrogant, "I lied to you just now."

Xia Ge: "..."

Forget it.

Xia Ge looked at the empty seat not far away from Huo Bai, "Huo Bai really left."

Mao Qing said, "Yes."

Xia Ge said, "Did you say anything when he left?"

Mao Qing said, "I bought three pounds of peppermint candy for him."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge turned back incredulously, "What did you say? Three pounds? Why didn't you buy three pounds for me?"

Mao Qing looked at her, twirling the cherry blossom candy Xia Ge gave her, and looked at her strangely, "Are you leaving too?"

Xia Ge said, "No, who's leaving? I'm not leaving. I didn't mean the candy... Did you see him before he left?"

That Huo Bai yesterday was not the same as before. If he rashly left...

Xia Ge's heart skipped a beat.

"What's with that look? It's like I stole something from you." Mao Qing paused, teasing, "Did Huo Bai really give you a love letter? Are you jealous that I gave him candy?"

Xia Ge looked at her with dead fish eyes, "..."

Mao Qing casually flipped through the alchemy book and chuckled, "Don't worry, I didn't say goodbye to him."

Xia Ge: "..." Why does she need to worry? Is she very concerned about Huo Bai? Suffocating.
Xia Ge: "So you said you bought him three pounds of candy?"

System: "..." How much do you care about those three pounds of candy?

"I went to buy him three pounds of peppermint candy, but when I got there, he had already left," Mao Qing said, holding her chin with one hand and casually flipping through a book. She finally stopped on the page where Xia Ge had asked her about the Hundred Soul Pill.

Xia Ge breathed a sigh of relief. "So you didn't see him?"

"No."

Xia Ge rubbed her hands together. "What about the candy?"

System: "..."

Mao Qing said, "I left it in the dormitory."

Xia Ge gave Mao Qing a flirtatious look. "Ah Qing, we share both good and bad times."

Mao Qing touched her chin and smiled wryly. "We didn't even buy coconut cake together. Where's the sharing?"

Xia Ge said, "Well, the store is closed now. It would be a wasted trip if we went. I'm just thinking about you!"

The last "ma" was emphasized.

System: "..."

Mao Qing said, "Oh," and thought for a moment. "I'll consider it."

Xia Ge: "..."

Yan Ze was so much better.

If it were Yan Ze, he would have given it to her without hesitation.

System: "...Yan Ze's gone. Can you calm down?"

Mao Qing looked at the introduction to the pill on the book, squinted her eyes, and after a while, she asked casually, "You can make all the pills mentioned here?"

Xia Ge silently looked at her and then reached out to touch her forehead.
Ma Qing's body slightly stiffened as she was inexplicably touched on the forehead. Then she relaxed again, "......?"

Xia Ge muttered, "You don't have a fever? Why are you talking nonsense?"

Ma Qing: "......"

Xia Ge: "Don't you know my weight?"

Ma Qing responded with an "Oh," and was about to say something, but suddenly her expression changed.

Xia Ge vaguely felt that something was wrong, but before she could react, Dan Shu, which was covering her face, was pulled away, and the next moment she was hit hard on the forehead.

"Xia Wuyin." The goatee-faced man looked at her with a stern expression, "I see that your skin is getting itchier and itchier! Huh? You're not studying well in the morning class, and you're harassing your female classmates?! What about your face?! Did you put the book in the dog's stomach?!"

Xia Ge: "Ah no, I......" I didn't harass my female classmates! How can I harass them when they are all girls?!

"You still want to argue?!"

The teacher got angrier as he spoke, and finally threw the Dan Shu in his hand onto Xia Ge's desk with a loud "pa". "Am I blind? Can I still be mistaken?!" Go out and face the wall!"

Ma Qing was holding her chin and watching her. Xia Ge glanced over and saw that the female classmate who was harassed by Ma was smirking, looking particularly beautiful.

Xia Ge picked up the book and bowed to the teacher, "......I'm sorry, teacher. I will never harass my female classmates again."

Many people nearby laughed "pu" out loud.

The teacher's face was full of disgust, "Go, go, go, face the wall, and don't come back until class is over!"

The morning air was particularly fresh.

Xia Ge held the book and looked at the phoenix tree outside the courtyard, her mind empty.

System: "Why did you lie just now?"

Xia Ge was still immersed in the aftermath of "harassing female classmates" and was slow to react, "Ah... did I lie?"

System: "All the elixirs in this book can be completely refined if you want to."

Xia Ge: "Oh, really?" Wait, how did she harass her female classmates just now? Just... touched her forehead?

But what Ma Qing said did sound like she had a fever. She hadn't even finished reading everything in the Dan Shu once, so how could she know everything?
System: "......"

The system couldn't help but roar: "Why not?! Don't you want to become a celestial-level alchemist? You have the innate alchemy vein in your system! Isn't it a piece of cake to refine anything you want?!" Why do you live like an outsider more than it does?!

Xia Ge: "Oh, sorry, I didn't think of that just now..."

System: "......"

The faint light of early autumn shone, and the morning glow in the sky was brilliant. Xia Ge looked at her book for a while, then suddenly said: "But don't you think...it's boring to do it that way?"

System: "What?"

"What Mao Qing said to me that day." Xia Ge held her book and looked at the dense leaves above her head. "She said...I could become a earth-level alchemist."

-Everyone is saying that you can.

-Since you can...if I work hard, maybe I can too.

-Whether I succeed or not, at least you gave me the courage to pursue it.

The system didn't quite understand: "So what?" What does that mean?

The scattered sunlight fell, and Xia Ge said: "So, because of you, I easily became an earth-level alchemist, but for her to achieve her dream, it's really difficult."

Xia Ge slowly closed the book and whispered, "If I rely on you to become an earth-level or even celestial-level alchemist, then I...don't deserve to be her courage."

Xia Ge: "But still, I told her...you can become an earth-level alchemist."

The system fell silent.

Xia Ge looked up at the sky, "What does it feel like, just like a person who ranked last in class and cheated to get first place, telling someone at the same level as them, as long as you work hard, you can be like me."

System: "You can't say that."

"You're right, I really can't say that, that example is a bit inappropriate." Xia Ge said slowly, "Because that last place person may really be able to become first place by relying on that sentence and their own efforts."

"But in this Dan Peak where the alchemy vein cultivation method is missing." Xia Ge whispered, "Where should Mao Qing work hard?"

System: "Just take care of yourself, why do you care so much about others?"

Xia Ge worriedly said, "I always feel like I should take responsibility for what I say."
The system murmured, "You tell so many lies, but I haven't seen you take responsibility for any of them."

Xia Ge covered her face with the book and said, "Well, that's different. The things I say don't guide people's life direction. They're just about eating, drinking, and going to the bathroom. There's no guilt involved."

The system said, "..." It's a relief that you even know what guilt means.

After thinking for a moment, the system said, "But I think what you're saying..."

It paused and said, "Is meaningless."

Xia Ge asked, "Huh? How is it..." meaningless?

The system interrupted her and said, "As an alchemist, you shouldn't become someone's target or courage."

"Entering the peak of alchemy should not be for someone's expectations or beliefs."

"You've always thought you were right, but you're on the wrong path."

Xia Ge asked, "Ah... Do I have that problem?"

The system replied, "Yes."

"We are born as one and die as one."

"Xia Ge, I'm not your cheat device."

"I am your innate talent."

There is no need to feel guilty or uneasy.

It's always been your innate talent, and you should move forward with confidence.
