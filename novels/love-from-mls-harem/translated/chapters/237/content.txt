"Ah ah ah ah - there's a monster behind us ah ah ah -"

Summer quickly regained her senses and closed her eyes in a frightened manner, holding the child tightly and screaming, "Ah ah ah we're going to die - help, help!"

The sharp scream temporarily broke the state of being mesmerized by the Soul Stealing technique, but it still allowed the affected soul to unconsciously obey its own commands!

- Closed.

The beautiful eyes were closed.

Closed?!

Chu Yao suddenly came back to her senses, but she felt inexplicably anxious.

Very anxious.

She wanted... she wanted to take another look.

... He's shouting for help?

Save him!

- It's my duty!

"Chirp -"

The long sword flipped in an instant, and the girl didn't even look back, just staring at the green-hatted boy who was holding the little girl in a frightened manner with his eyes closed and head lowered. Her sword in her other hand slashed straight into the forehead of the demonic puppet with the green-faced fangs mask that was trying to sneak attack her from behind!

Chu Yao's long sword trembled slightly downwards, and the puppet was split in half from the forehead and fell to the ground with a loud thud.

Anyone who wants to harm this person... no matter who it is, must be killed!!

That kind of thought was like madness, surging in her heart.

"Hey."

The girl's voice was slightly low, and Summer tightly closed her eyes, holding the frightened little girl, her whole body trembling slightly.

Will she be discovered?

Puppet secret technique Soul Stealing - can control all puppets with Soul Fire from grade A to E, as well as the skills of human souls with strength from grade A to SS.
The strength of a person can be divided into F to 3S, and the soul can also be divided into these levels.

However, she is currently just a puppet apprentice and can only control puppet soul fires below level B, as well as people with souls at the same level. But she still has a certain influence on levels A to 3S.

Sword cultivators in Sword Peak generally focus on cultivating their strength and swordsmanship, and do not study soul techniques much. So, this Sword Peak girl...must have fallen for it!

It's not a big deal to be controlled now, but when this person comes to their senses in a few days, she's sure to be dead!!

Damn!

But the only thing worth celebrating is that this person probably doesn't know who she is.

Xia Ge's brain quickly turned.

Her "Soul Stealing" technique is rarely used and her proficiency is not enough, so it should not affect the other person for too long. Just now, when she shouted "help", it was actually equivalent to giving the other person a command. With her current level and the other person's strength, after completing this "command", there should be no more influence.

Stay calm, Xia Ge, stay calm.

Xia Ge slowly calmed down.

That was stunning at first sight.

Chu Yao tried to speak in her gentlest voice, wanting to take another look, but it turned into a command when it came out, "You, open your eyes for me..."

Although she really wanted to look, she couldn't help but remember what happened to her chest last night when she saw the dwarf's face...

Thinking of everything that happened to her chest last night...

Chu Yao: "..." Can't be gentle anymore.

Xia Ge: "..."

She's not stupid!

Seeing that she didn't respond, Chu Yao tried to coax her, "Open your eyes, I'll perform a magic trick for you."

Chu Yao thought, even if she's mischievous, she's still just a kid.

Xia Ge: "..."

Hey...this kind of stupid conversation can only fool a child, right?
She just tricked the six-year-old girl in her arms three seconds ago, but the girl still hasn't realized it yet.

But it doesn't matter, whether she's lying with her eyes open or talking nonsense with her eyes closed, she's a master at both!

Xia Ge: "Sister...you're so cool! But when the cape floated over just now, it seemed to have scratched my eyes...I'm blinded by your coolness and can't open them..."

...Scratched her eyes with the cape? Blinded by her coolness and can't open them?

What kind of nonsense is this?

Before Chu Yao could reply, Li Liu suddenly shouted, "Danger--"

There were many enchanted puppets attacking the village this time, but in Chu Yao's eyes, they were all useless.

"Forget it." Chu Yao couldn't care less about the guy who kept talking nonsense and was charging towards them recklessly. She skillfully wielded her long sword, creating a beautiful sword flower. She reached out and rubbed the head of the little girl in Xia Ge's arms who was staring blankly, and her gaze unintentionally swept over the blue hairband tied in a bun on the other's head. "Don't mind the shorty, but you should watch carefully. I rarely perform magic tricks for others--"

The little girl with empty eyes looked at the enchanted puppets rushing towards Chu Yao as if she was looking at insurmountable peaks. Her pupils shrank to the size of a needle tip, and in an instant, despair filled her eyes.

Chu Yao turned her head and smiled brightly at the girl, revealing her sharp tiger teeth. Her light brown almond eyes shone under the last rays of the setting sun. "Remember, this magic trick is called--"

The young girl raised her sword tip slightly and aimed at the group of enchanted puppets charging towards them, making a light swipe.

"Swoosh--"

All the puppets stopped moving.

Xia Ge closed her eyes, not knowing what had happened, but in a state of "Soul Stealing and Soul Snatching", she was particularly sensitive to the soul fire of the puppets. At this moment, the soul fire of all the puppets had been extinguished.

Xia Ge's expression, which had been as calm as an old dog, cracked for a moment.

...She had thought that the reinforcements from Jianfeng might be handsome and strong.

But she never expected them to be this strong!

A suffocating silence enveloped them.

Countless sickles were swept away by the sword energy, and a rolling killing intent swept around them!

Under the infinite sunset glow, in the midst of the rampant sword energy, the girl's voice contained a hint of laughter and vitality.

"One sword, breaks the He Shan."
The sword energy that broke through the air was so dangerous that it sent shivers down people's spines. Li Liu and the outer disciples who were watching subconsciously took a step back. The puppets that were charging forward all stopped in their tracks, their sickles dropped from their hands. As soon as Chu Yao finished speaking, their bodies shattered into pieces in the blink of an eye.

The shattered bodies of the puppet monsters that fell to the ground with a loud thud, and the sickles that were effortlessly sliced apart by the sword energy, mixed with the last rays of the setting sun, slowly condensed into a point of light in the hollow eyes of the girl with the bun hairstyle. It pierced through the endless darkness and brought the dawn of hope.

"..."

After a suffocating silence, the voices of the villagers sounded dazedly. "Is it over?"

"It's over!!"

"Chu Daren, the master of the sword, is truly amazing!"

"No wonder... even if the others didn't come, it doesn't matter, with Chu Daren alone, it's enough!"

"Only with one sword..."

"Chu Daren's famous One Sword Breaking Mountains and Rivers has reached this level of cultivation? Congratulations!"

"What a powerful strength! Chu Daren must be the leader of this Sword Edge Inquiry! The title of Sword Edge's top disciple is within reach!"

"Truly a hero from a young age!"

"..."

Li Liu looked at the green-haired boy who was still crouching on the ground, holding the little girl tightly in his arms. In a daze, he said the sentence he didn't finish earlier.

"But..."

"You're just a child too."

But the other party obviously couldn't hear his explanation.

He closed his eyes and withdrew his complicated thoughts, only to remember that he had stepped on something just now.

Looking down, Li Liu realized that he had stepped on a half-wrapped oil-paper pancake. The originally golden pancake was already covered in mud, and he had unintentionally stepped on it twice due to nervousness...

It was a bit... unsightly.

This pancake seemed to...

However, before he could think further, he suddenly heard a scream, "Ah-ah!"
