Chapter 233: I'm very happy

The protagonist of the novel had finally achieved his long-awaited goal. He had overcome many obstacles and challenges, but he never gave up. Now, he was standing on the top of the mountain, looking down at the world below. He felt a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that he had never felt before.

"I'm very happy," he said to himself. "All the hard work was worth it."

As a translator, I couldn't help but feel the same way. Translating this novel was not an easy task, but seeing the final product made me feel proud and fulfilled. I was happy to have been a part of bringing this story to an English-speaking audience.

I closed my laptop and looked out the window. The sun was setting, casting a warm glow over the city. I smiled to myself, feeling content and grateful for the opportunity to do what I love.
