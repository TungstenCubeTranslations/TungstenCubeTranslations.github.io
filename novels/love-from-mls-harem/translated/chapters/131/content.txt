...Go to hell with your gift.

Xia Ge got up from the ground, tearing off his own clothes with a "stab" sound. A piece of black cloth was torn off and nailed to the wall with a hairpin, which was impossible to pull out.

Xia Ge patted the dust off his body, wearing tattered night clothes. He picked up the scattered fruits from the ground and put them on the table without changing his expression, saying coldly, "This is a robbery."

Chu Yao propped up her cheeks and had a hint of a smile in her almond-shaped eyes. "Robbery of money or robbery of love?"

Xia Ge glanced at her and said, "Whatever can be robbed."

Chu Yao asked, "There is nothing to rob here, right?"

Xia Ge: "..."

Chu Yao asked again, "Do you want to rob me?"

Xia Ge looked at the scattered fruits on the table, slammed the table and grabbed Chu Yao's collar, boldly saying, "Robbery!"

Half an hour later.

Under a clear sky and a crescent moon, dotted with stars, the night was a deep blue. In this soft and profound night, a small city with bright lights still had a bustling crowd. People passed each other on the street, and various vendors shouted loudly, without any silence of the night.

"Selling sugar-coated haws..."

"Sugar painting, sugar painting..."

"... "

Xia Ge, wearing tattered night clothes, and the bewildered Miss Chu from the Chu family stood at the street corner. Chu Yao was caught off guard and pulled over. She was wearing revealing clothes and had not had time to put on formal attire.

System: "..." Are you deliberately taking revenge on her?

However, Chu Yao, wearing revealing clothes and wooden clogs, was calm and held the boy's hand quietly with a colorful stone bracelet on her wrist. She did not feel anxious at all, even though she was suddenly taken to an unknown place without a sword on her back.

She just felt... very relieved.

Chu Yao looked down and asked, "Where are we?"

Xia Ge held her hand and tied up his torn clothes. He tried to look like a bad guy and said, "Don't talk. You have been kidnapped by me! Now I am a robber, and you are my little captive!"
Chu Yao: "...aren't you a flower thief?"

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge stiffened his neck: "No!"

Chu Yao's eyes showed a hint of a smile, she raised her eyebrows and cooperated very well: "Then, little thief, this lady has no clothes to wear now."

In the dimly lit street corner, the lanterns shone weakly, and the girl pretended to be a lady, her usually arrogant eyes softened in this faint light.

Xia Ge: "..."

She didn't deliberately bring her here without letting her change clothes! It's just that she scraped her new night clothes, hmph.

Xia Ge: "...You stay here, I'll go buy clothes."

The two of them were standing in a dark and unnoticed street corner.

Chu Yao smiled and said, "I can walk, little thief."

Xia Ge: "You won't run away, will you?"

Chu Yao raised her eyes slightly and looked at the brightly lit and bustling area not far away.

This is the city that never sleeps.

In the Wind and Moon Continent, visitors from all over the world gather here, and there is never a day without night in this city.

It is said that the teleportation stones here are extremely difficult to obtain.

Chu Yao's lips curled up slightly, and her usually fierce eyes became gentle, "If you take away something important to me, I won't leave."

Xia Ge reached over and grabbed Chu Yao's beaded bracelet from her right hand, raising his eyebrows: "I was thinking the same thing. Well, now I'm not afraid you'll leave."

Her right wrist was now empty.

The beaded bracelet was just something she wore out of boredom, like the silver hairpin she casually threw away. However, now in the boy's hand, it seemed to accentuate how tender and small his hand was.

Something that had no meaning to her seemed to be given important value at this moment.

Chu Yao paused and looked at the boy's white and tender hand, thinking.
This boy looks more and more effeminate.

"You took something very important," Chu Yao raised an eyebrow, playing along with her act, "although I can't walk,"

Chu Yao deliberately made things difficult for him, "but I only wear very expensive clothes."

"I can't afford it," Xia Ge responded like a qualified robber, then put on a fierce look, "I'll buy whatever I want, and you wear what I buy!"

The expression on the boy's white and tender cheeks was not scary at all, but rather like making a face.

Chu Yao suppressed her laughter and tried to learn the aggrieved look of the maid Xiaoqing, "Oh."

The boy snorted, turned around to buy clothes, took a few steps, and turned back.

"Stand still and don't move!"

Like admonishing a child.

Clearly, he was even younger than her.

Chu Yao watched the boy, dressed in black, walking into the bustling street, while she stood in the corner, covered in darkness. For some reason, she suddenly felt lonely.

The scene of kneeling in the ancestral hall when she was a child slowly appeared in front of her eyes.

"You bear the responsibility of the Chu family on your shoulders! You are different from others!"

"..."

When her father was lecturing her, that snow-white garment was quietly in front of her.

The Chu Blade Spirit.

The strongest battle armor that allowed the Chu family to stand firmly at the top of all clans.

Kneeling until midnight, her mother secretly came to bring her food.

She advised her, "Yao Yao, be good and eat something."

She said, "I don't want to."

Mother sighed, then saw the Chu Blade Spirit.
The snow-white clothes were finely sewn with golden five-clawed dragons, matching the battle armor.

"Legend has it that every stitch of this garment is sewn by the Chu King himself," Mother said softly after looking at it for a while.

"And... this garment wasn't originally called the Sacrificial Spirit."

She was intrigued and looked up at her mother.

Mother then let her eat.

"After you finish eating, I'll tell you," she said.

She was curious and obediently ate until she was full. Mother patted her head and smiled, "I don't know what it was originally called."

Chu Yao: "..."

Mother put away the food box. "But this is indeed a garment sewn by the Chu King, who loves war and hates women's work, stitch by stitch, for someone."

"Who is that person?"

"I don't know."

The young Chu Yao was still very naive. "But why did she have to sew the clothes herself? If she hates it, can't she just let someone else do it?"

Mother just smiled and sighed lightly, "Yao Yao, the great and lofty king is very lonely."

After a pause, she continued.

"Or perhaps, being great and lofty is just a lonely existence."

She was puzzled, "Does being lonely mean you have to sew your own clothes?"

"Silly child, you'll understand when you grow up," Mother sighed in the dark ancestral hall, where the candlelight flickered. "But I don't want you to become the head of the Chu family..."

"Why not?"

Everyone around her hoped she would become the head of the family, like the Chu King of the past.

"To be the head of the family, you have to wear a sword, fight alone like the Chu King, and spend your whole life in battle," Mother's voice was soft. "No one to accompany you... Yao Yao, you're still young, I don't want you to regret it."

"I won't regret it," Chu Yao said.
"Back then, the King of Chu said the same thing," said the mother, quoting from a history book, "I am willing to abandon the body of the princess and gain the name of bravery, to fight on the battlefield, to die in battle, in order to seek peace and tranquility for the country."

"This life should have no regrets."

Chu Yao remembered that she wasn't very rebellious at the time and admired the wise and righteous King of Chu.

"So... did she regret it?" 

"I don't know if she regretted it," the mother said.

"But the Chu family has such a family rule."

"Any daughter of the Chu family who marries her beloved husband must abandon the sword and seek a peaceful and healthy life until old age."

"What does that mean?"

"It means... after marrying, the daughters of the Chu family cannot wield swords anymore. They must focus on being a good wife and mother, and seek a peaceful and healthy life until old age."

"This was the last family rule set by the King of Chu before he committed suicide."

That night, the stars were not as bright as they were now.

Chu Yao raised her head and looked at the sky full of stars.

So, did that lonely and proud king regret it in the end?

Regretting a lifetime of war, with no one to accompany him?

She wouldn't be as pathetic as that guy, even if she regretted it, she wouldn't dare to say it.

Because she wouldn't regret it.

Just as she was thinking, her eyes were suddenly covered by a soft fabric. A light veil brushed her face, and everything became blurry for a moment. Chu Yao's body tensed up, but then relaxed again the next moment.

A familiar scent and voice quietly echoed in her ear.

"The autumn stars flow like fire, and I stay up all night to write a poem; under the bright lights of the city, it's time for the annual farewell of the geese."

"Welcome to the sleepless city, little captive kidnapped by a little thief," said a young, crisp voice, as if bringing the fireworks of the mortal world and smashing the most fragile loneliness in the heart with the simplest words.
——Being high and mighty is a lonely state.

Xia Ge didn't have much time to feel proud before the clothes thrown at Chu Yao's head suddenly fell down. Chu Yao had attacked her from behind, and now that the clothes were over her head, she couldn't see anything. Chu Yao held her thin shoulders and pressed her against the wall, breathing shallowly and with a faint smile.

"Who's the robber?" Chu Yao asked.

Xia Ge remained silent.

"I am! And you're my captive! You can't..." Xia Ge protested, but Chu Yao interrupted her by pressing her down and lifting her chin with one hand.

"If I don't teach you some manners, you won't know who's the boss around here, little captive," Chu Yao said, mimicking Xia Ge's speech.

Xia Ge struggled, but her body, purified by dragon blood, was no match for Chu Yao's seemingly casual but effective hold. She couldn't move at all, feeling like her lifeline was being cut off.

After a moment, Xia Ge said, "The script isn't like this. You're breaking the rules!"

Chu Yao asked, "What script?"

Xia Ge changed the subject, "I'm a robber and I've kidnapped you."

"But you said you had nothing, and that's why I kidnapped you. So, you're the captive," Chu Yao pointed out.

Xia Ge looked up at her, "If you had nothing, I could have kidnapped you and we could have lived a life of luxury together."

The system said, "...It's more realistic to drink northwest wind with you."

Chu Yao asked, "If I said I have everything, would you still kidnap me?"

Xia Ge hesitated before saying, "Yes, I would."

After a pause, Xia Ge said seriously, "But what's important is to follow the script!"
Chu Yao asked, "What's the script?"

Xia Ge blurted out, "A beautiful captive of a domineering bandit."

The system: "......"

Do you really dare to say that?!

Chu Yao said, "???"

Xia Ge coughed, "You don't understand even if I tell you... just remember, whether you like it or not, you are my captive!"

Chu Yao said, "I've never seen a bandit who can recite poetry."

Chu Yao was wearing revealing clothing, and the clothes Xia Ge bought for her were covering her head.

Xia Ge retorted, "I've never seen a bandit who doesn't wear clothes either!"

He smoothly buried the evil deeds of intentionally letting her wear revealing clothing and then teleporting away.

Chu Yao said, "Oh," "Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist."

Xia Ge said, "......"

Xia Ge couldn't argue back, so he could only whine, "You cheated! Cheated!"

Chu Yao was in a good mood, "I didn't."

She lifted the clothes Xia Ge bought and in the bright moment before his eyes, Xia Ge saw Chu Yao's cute little fang.

"It's just switching roles, my little captive."

Xia Ge hadn't even come up with a response when he felt a slight chill on his wrist. The colorful stone bracelet he had put in his pocket had been taken out by Chu Yao and put on her right wrist.

Xia Ge was slightly surprised, but the bandit who had been holding her had already changed her clothes.

Light blue and soft white silk, tied with a butterfly knot at the waist, wooden clogs with white toes covered by the skirt, and black hair tied up with a light blue headband, softening Chu Yao's usually arrogant eyebrows and eyes.

In the dim light, the usually unruly girl showed a hint of tenderness.

Xia Ge thought, she really is a beautiful person, it's no wonder she sold so many elixirs for spirit stones.
...However, looking at the broken tiles she kicked over in the council hall, which she had repaired so well, it seemed that she had spent much more money on that than on this dress.

Truly poor, poor.

The dress unexpectedly fit her well.

Chu Yao grinned, taking the hand of the girl wearing a colorful stone bracelet. "Let's go, little captive."

Xia Ge protested, "I'm a bandit!!"

Chu Yao gave her a sidelong glance, her light brown almond eyes faintly threatening.

Xia Ge corrected herself, "Uh, your little captive."

There was nothing gentle about her, it was all fake.

The sky over the city that never sleeps was deep, with a blackish-blue hue, the starlight shining, and the crescent moon was very gentle.

The crowd was bustling.

Xia Ge nibbled on the candy painting that Chu Yao had bought for her, thinking.

...Just let her be the little captive.

Anyway, whoever was the bandit should pay.

Actually, she had wanted to treat them...hmm.

This was a profitable venture.

"Ahem, Bandit Lord, I want to drink from that place..."

"Which place?"

"That one!"
