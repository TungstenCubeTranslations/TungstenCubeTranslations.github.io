Xia Ge looked at the strange red silk and felt goosebumps all over her body. But since she couldn't break through the formation on the door, maybe she could do something about the silk? She decisively floated over and pulled the part that the other party had raised. The silk was so obedient that as soon as she pulled it, it lowered its head, and then the gorgeously decorated elegant room presented a comical scene. A short paper man was pulling a long red silk, indifferently dragging it onto the soft couch in the room, and then forcefully stuffing the silk under the pillow. However, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get it in. Just as Xia Ge was about to give up and try another method, the silk lifted its tail, gently rubbed her paper cheek, and then elegantly and slowly slid under the pillow, covering itself tightly. Xia Ge thought to herself, "You're quite smart." 

Not long after it had disappeared under the pillow, Xia Ge felt her paper body getting slightly warmer, and the next second, a white smoke enveloped her. Instinctively, she pulled the blanket on the soft couch to wrap herself tightly, then quickly took out the black cloak from her ring and changed her clothes in a few minutes. She then jumped off the couch, opened the door, and returned to her original form. As expected, the door opened easily. Xia Ge was about to run away without even putting on her shoes when she suddenly heard a "swish" sound and felt something wrapped around her ankle. She paused, closed the door with a "bang," and pulled apart her tattered cloak, only to see a bright red silk wrapped around her snow-white ankle, looking reluctant to let go. Wasn't this the same silk that was so huge and shy before? 

But now that she had returned to her original form, the huge silk was just a thin red ribbon, and it didn't seem threatening at all. Xia Ge said, "What kind of trash are you?" and pulled the ribbon off her ankle. The ribbon nodded vigorously, showing complete trust. One minute later, Xia Ge looked at the red ribbon tied in a bow on the leg of a small table and clapped her hands in satisfaction. She took out a bronze mask from her ring and said, "It's so pretty, it suits you so well." The silly red ribbon happily lifted one of the tails of the bow. "Yes, yes, it's so pretty. Let's say goodbye for now." Xia Ge waved her hand, and the ribbon hesitated for a moment before suddenly struggling. However, Xia Ge had tied the bow tightly, and it couldn't be untied. Xia Ge opened the door with a sense of satisfaction, raised her head, and said, "Tsk tsk, if you can untie it, I'll follow you..." Xia Ge felt her neck stiffen, and the next second, she was about to close the door with a "bang"!
However, things didn't go as planned. A figure wearing a hooded cloak and a bamboo hat was standing outside the door, and with one hand, he easily stopped the door from closing and slipped inside.

"Ah, I'm sorry, I actually got the wrong room, I'll just go..."

Seeing someone come in, Xia Ge laughed awkwardly, trying to forget the embarrassing fact that she had just been shut out of this room. She turned her body and tried to slip away as if nothing had happened, but suddenly, her shoulder was grabbed.

"I really didn't mean it..."

The hooded figure that had just entered didn't say anything, but just looked at her, as if examining her clothes with some confusion. Xia Ge looked at the familiar bamboo hat and suddenly realized that this was the fool who had spent one hundred mid-grade spirit stones to buy her the Qi-opening Pill!

Xia Ge instinctively clutched her own cloak and became wary. "My clothes are not for sale! Oh no, I'm not selling myself! No, I mean, I've already spent the one hundred spirit stones and won't return them!"

The hooded figure seemed speechless, paused for a moment, and finally spoke in a low, hoarse voice. "Don't go out."

Xia Ge was wary. "You're not here to collect the money, nor do you treat me as a thief?"

The hooded figure replied, "I brought you in, why would you be a thief?"

Xia Ge was silent for a moment, then widened her eyes under the bronze mask. "You...you know that the paper man just now was..."

The hooded figure was silent for a moment before saying in a flat tone, "Don't ask."

After speaking, she took out several neatly folded clothes from under her cloak and placed them on the soft couch. Her movements were gentle, but her slender fingers wrapped in blood-red silk were exposed. Xia Ge looked at her hand and instinctively felt that this person...should be a woman.

She arranged the clothes neatly and finally took out a small fox mask from under her cloak. Her slender fingers stroked the red ears of the little fox, and it smiled with its eyes curved and its mouth playfully raised, looking mischievous and innocent.

She held the mask, paused for a moment, and then looked at Xia Ge.

Xia Ge clasped her hands behind her back, twisted them together, and was thinking about how to get some information from the other person, but suddenly the hooded figure stopped all movement and looked at her thoughtfully while holding the fox mask.

Although the other person was wearing a bamboo hat, Xia Ge couldn't help but feel goosebumps all over her body.

Xia Ge decided that she couldn't just be stared at like this, so she decided to take the initiative to talk and make small talk. She tapped her side and asked, "Um...you just went out to buy clothes?"

The hooded figure was silent for a moment before saying, "Yes."

Xia Ge looked at the clothes she had bought, a white undergarment underneath, and then a set of black silk clothes that looked very soft, neatly folded. But at first glance, wasn't the size a bit small?
Xia Ge silently raised her head to observe the other person's height, then turned her head to look at the clothes and hesitated for a moment. "Um... this clothing size seems a bit small."

Could it be that this person was like her, looking tall but actually having a false height of over twenty centimeters?

...No way.

Doesn't seem like it.

"Not small," the cloaked person said, "just right."

Xia Ge couldn't help but ask, "Are you also wearing elevator shoes?"

The system: "..."

The cloaked person: "Hm?"

Xia Ge: "It's nothing, I'm just joking, haha."

The cloaked person looked at her for a moment, then took the mask and walked towards her from the soft couch. The height difference of 20 centimeters between one meter seventy and one meter fifty suddenly brought a strong psychological pressure, and Xia Ge instinctively wanted to step back, but there was a door behind her. With every step the person took, she took two steps back until her back firmly pressed against the door.

The cloaked person's voice was calm and flat, "Afraid?"

Xia Ge forced a smile, "Not really."

After a pause, she whispered, "It's just... you're a bit tall."

The cloaked person held the fox mask and, upon hearing this, seemed to be thinking about something. "Tall, so you're afraid?"

Xia Ge was embarrassed, "It's a bit stressful."

The cloaked person paused, let out a low sigh, and reached out to grab her shoulder with his hand wrapped in red silk. "So, you still know how to be afraid."

Xia Ge: "???"

The next moment, Xia Ge felt herself being lightly lifted by the other person's shoulder, and in an instant, her bare feet that were stepping on the cold ground were moved to the soft couch as if the heavens and earth had shifted. She opened her eyes wide behind the bronze mask, and at her feet were the neatly folded clothes of the other person, while in front of her was the cloaked person's hat that covered his face.

The cloaked person put her on the soft couch and stood below. She held the small fox mask and looked up at Xia Ge, her voice indifferent. "Like this, are you still afraid?"

Standing on the soft couch with bare feet, Xia Ge had not yet recovered from her shock. She instinctively said, "Not afraid anymore."

But when she realized what she had said, Xia Ge despaired as she found herself getting farther and farther from the door.
Cloaked Figure: "Hmm."

After a moment, they added, "Don't be afraid."

After speaking, they reached out to remove Xia Ge's mask. Xia Ge was startled and covered her mask with her hand. "You can't take it off!"

The cloaked figure looked at the fox mask in their hand. "I'll give you a different one."

Xia Ge replied, "...But you still can't take it off!"

The cloaked figure thought for a moment. "But it looks just like you."

Xia Ge glanced at the cunning little fox with a smile. "..."

What a lie! How does she look like a fox?!

Xia Ge hesitated. "No, I don't."

"Hmm, then you don't," the cloaked figure stated. "But you're wanted in the black market."

Xia Ge replied, "..."

She added, "Bronze mask, five or six feet tall, tattered cloak."

Thinking of what Bai Ren said when they escaped, Xia Ge knew they weren't joking.

After a moment, the cloaked figure's voice softened. "Put this on, I'll close my eyes."

Xia Ge looked at the completely faceless hood. "..."

It's really not trustworthy at all, suffocating.

"Who are you?" Xia Ge decided not to beat around the bush. She put down her hand. "Do I know you? Why are you helping me?"

The cloaked figure remained silent. Just when Xia Ge was waiting for a response, her face suddenly felt a slight chill.

The narrow view from the bronze mask suddenly widened. Before Xia Ge could react, the delicate hand wrapped in red silk lightly placed the fox mask on her face.

The small fox mask fit perfectly on her face. With a wide view, the fingertips wrapped in red silk accidentally brushed against her cheek, bringing a shallow warmth. Xia Ge widened her eyes. "You..."

The cloaked figure held the bronze mask with a missing corner. "I closed my eyes."
Xia Ge felt aggrieved in her heart: "...you're lying, aren't you?"

The Cloaked Figure said, "I'm not lying."

Xia Ge asked, "Then who are you?"

The Cloaked Figure avoided the question and looked at a red ribbon tied into a butterfly not far away, pitifully stating, "You wrapped it up."

It was true that the Cloaked Figure wasn't lying, they just didn't answer questions they didn't want to.

The thin red ribbon caught the attention of its owner and began to wiggle excitedly, sending out distress signals, but in reality, the Cloaked Figure only made a statement and didn't do anything else.

Xia Ge said, "..."

Xia Ge felt like this was a familiar tactic. Instead of lying, just avoid answering the question.

The System said, "...isn't that what you do all the time?"

Xia Ge was frustrated, "You talk too much, who is she?"

The System said, "The cloak is in the way, I can't detect her."

Just as Xia Ge was racking her brain to try and figure out the Cloaked Figure's identity, they said, "If you really want to know, then ask a different question."

Xia Ge rolled her eyes, "I'm not playing. Who knows if you're lying or not, I don't believe you."

"I'm not lying," the Cloaked Figure said, "As long as you don't lie, I won't lie."

Xia Ge asked, "But how do I know that you're not lying?"

The Cloaked Figure simply said, "I'm not deceiving you."

Xia Ge said, "..."

The Cloaked Figure seemed to realize that this wasn't very convincing, so they thought for a moment and took out a fist-sized, round, green ball.

"This is the Language Sphere," they paused, "If you say something false in front of it, the falsehood will become true."

Xia Ge said, "Ah?"

"But if it's the truth, then the Language Sphere won't have any effect," the Cloaked Figure's voice was flat, "That's all there is to it."

 
Xia Ge's first reaction was, "If I say I'm a multi-millionaire, will it come true?"

The system replied, "..." Hey.

The Cloaked Figure said, "Well, it looks like you're not."

Xia Ge thought, "Did you just laugh? You definitely laughed, didn't you?!"

The Cloaked Figure warned, "Don't lie in front of the Language Spirit Ball, because when you use it to turn lies into reality, it means you will pay a more terrible price than what you get."

"No one knows what that price is, it could be fortune, it could be soul, it could be life."

Xia Ge glanced at the Language Spirit Ball, and the system detected it.

[Language Spirit Ball·Earth: A rare and magical artifact that can turn lies into reality, but the price for making lies come true is extremely terrible. Use with caution.]

It seemed like Wo Ri wasn't joking around, there really was such a thing in this world?

It looked a bit dangerous no matter how she looked at it.

Xia Ge felt a bit uneasy, "Let's just talk casually, why take it so seriously?"

The Cloaked Figure's voice was calm, "Because you don't trust me."
