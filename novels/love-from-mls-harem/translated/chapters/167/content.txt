Chu Yao paused for a moment and said, "Long time no see."

Her voice was laced with a hint of coldness.

"Sister, no need to be nervous." Chu Yi controlled her emotions and chuckled lightly. "I came back this time just to see Father. I didn't plan to do anything else."

Chu Yao said, "We invited you with a grand procession, but you didn't come. This time you came by yourself, and I, on behalf of Father, am truly honored."

"Sister is so busy with affairs and short-handed, how could I dare to trouble her to invite me." Chu Yi spoke politely, but her eyes were full of disdain, as if she was looking at an ant in the mud, a shameless thief. Her cherry lips moved, and she said each word clearly, "I can't afford it."

The two of them were at odds, and the atmosphere was tense.

Chu Zhan felt a headache coming on.

Chu Yao saw her father's expression and paused for a moment. She didn't argue anymore and her face turned cold. "Since you're back, stay at home for a few more days. Father misses you very much."

"I miss you all too." Chu Yi softened her sharpness and chuckled lightly, looking at Chu Yao. "Especially... Sister."

"I really think about you day and night, and have trouble sleeping."

Chu Yao didn't bother with her sarcastic remarks. "If you really think about me that much, then stay and you won't have to miss me anymore."

Chu Yi said, "Okay."

= = 

Meanwhile, on Xia Ge's side.

After Xia Ge said, "I want to be her hero," the girl said, "Very well."

As soon as the girl finished speaking, like a password, the mist gradually dissipated, and the surrounding scenery became clear. Xia Ge then realized that she and the girl were standing in a vast basin, surrounded by tall mountains that stretched endlessly. In the gray sky, there were faintly visible winged beasts roaring, and the ground was trembling, as if there were fierce beasts running on this vast land. One could faintly hear their angry roars.

The atmosphere here was deep and oppressive, mixed with thick resentment, making people very uncomfortable.

As if in the moment the mist dissipated, they had gone from a safe world to a dangerous one, without a sound.

The animal instinct made the lost deer observe her surroundings with caution.

The girl said to Xia Ge, "Look behind you."

At the words, Xia Ge tightened the sickle in her hand slightly, but she also understood that even if the girl wanted to do something to her, she had no strength to resist.
This is an absolute gap in strength.

Xia Ge slowly turned around.

The mist behind disappeared without a trace. Looking over, there was nothing but mountains.

Xia Ge's heart jumped, and when she turned back again, the girl had disappeared.

The lost deer was still there, looking a little lost, tilting its head as it watched her.

Xia Ge: "..."

For a moment, Xia Ge felt a bit disillusioned, as if she was the subject of an April Fool's Day prank that only kindergarten classmates would play.

"...Xiao Kui, do you know this person?" Xia Ge casually asked, but there was no answer.

Just moments ago, Xiao Kui was so excited at the Time River.

Just as Xia Ge was puzzled, without the girl's hidden protection, the winged beasts in the sky let out a sharp roar and then swooped down towards Xia Ge as if they had received some kind of command.

"Gah-"

They had wings as hard as steel, beaks as hard as diamonds, and their black feathers shone like oil, like the grim reaper reaping human lives in the middle of the night, silently and swiftly bringing death as they attacked Xia Ge head-on with a deadly breath.

"Boom-"

They opened their mouths, and fierce flames spewed out, but Xia Ge activated her Ghost Shadow technique and dodged the attack with a few steps. She swung her scythe, and the black scythe shot towards the unknown beast's wing, creating sparks as it scraped against the feathers of the leader.

Xia Ge used all her strength, but it didn't even scratch the beast. This attack only enraged it, and it spread its wings, tearing through the wind, and clawed at Xia Ge's face.

The scythe was still hanging on the beast's wing, so Xia Ge had to release the chain. The hard black chain suddenly pulled apart the hard lines, isolating the claws from the outside.

"Clang...chirp-"

However, stopping one didn't mean it was over.

Seeing Xia Ge being restrained by the leader, groups of winged beasts opened their mouths and fierce flames spewed out again. The temperature of the flames was so high that it melted rocks and fossils along the way, like magma erupting from the earth's core or a flamethrower. The chain of the scythe trembled. The beast was not trying to tear the chain, but rather holding Xia Ge down, leaving her to bathe in the flames of death with nowhere to escape.
Xia Ge's pupils shrank, and in her pitch-black eyes, there was only the passionate yet merciless orange glow of the flames.

"I'm going to die," she thought.

Time seemed to slow down.

If she did nothing, she would undoubtedly die.

Time seemed to stand still, yet also seemed to flow endlessly.

The second before she was consumed by the flames, Xia Ge seemed to see the shadow of a gentle person in the scorching blaze.

She was wearing the familiar Dan Feng Su Yi that Xia Ge knew well, with soft red silk wrapped around her hand. She stood in front of her, facing the raging flames, and turned back to give her a slight smile.

Warm and kind, it was love at first sight.

In that moment, Xia Ge seemed to forget everything and only remembered reaching out to her, as if she could grasp onto something in that way.

Accompanied by a dazzling red light and electric sparks, the soft red silk was caught in her hand.

The next moment, the flames consumed everything!

On the mountaintop, at an altitude of ten thousand meters, the cold wind was biting. The girl who claimed to be a guide looked down at everything in the basin below the gray clouds and mist.

As the flames burned the black-haired girl, she let out a soft sigh. The figure under her hood seemed blurry yet real.

Only her voice was cold.

"What a pity."

"You will never be anyone's hero."

"Weakness is the original sin."

The cold wind was bleak.

As the flames gradually dissipated, everything seemed to have settled into dust.

This was just someone who had trespassed and was too weak to be qualified.
Although she vaguely felt that this person was capable, but...

Even several Flame Phoenixes couldn't stop him. He was just a useless person who talked big.

The outcome was already decided. The girl was too lazy to look at the charred body, turned around and was about to leave, but as soon as she turned, she froze.

The wind on the mountaintop brought a faint smell of burnt rocks.

But it seemed like there was another presence.

A faint, delicate breath, hidden deep in the wind.

"... Is it wrong to be weak?"

The next moment, the girl waved her long sleeves, and dark golden lightning flashed as it collided with the scarlet fabric clone that was carrying a powerful energy!

"Boom!"

The air exploded with a loud sound due to the strong pressure, but the girl didn't step back, not even her clothes moved much. The person who attacked was pushed back more than ten meters by the compressed air!

The red handkerchief still carried the scorching temperature, it blocked the Flame Phoenix's intense flames for Xia Ge, and carried her up into the sky to find the person who wanted to kill her.

"..."

The girl stood still, looking at Xia Ge, who was not far away, holding the red handkerchief. She repeated coldly, "It is wrong."

The cold wind on the mountaintop made Xia Ge sneeze, feeling hot and cold, very uncomfortable.

"Moreover, only by borrowing the power of others can you stand at this height." The girl said indifferently, "Don't you feel ashamed?"

"No." Xia Ge said, "The reason why people are people is because they use tools to make themselves stand higher. Why should they be ashamed? You're the strange one."

Pausing for a moment, Xia Ge tightened her grip on the handkerchief and said word by word, "Being weak is not a mistake."

The girl looked at her.

A person as weak as an ant told her that she wanted to become someone's hero.
She clearly knew she was overestimating herself, but she was proud as if she was shining all over. The strong have their own way of handling things, and the weak have their own way of living. When she said these words, her eyes were like those of a child who was spoiled and had no fear. "Everyone has no right to judge others' right or wrong?" But in the end, in this world, being powerful is the real power. The girl looked at Xia Ge for a while, and suddenly said with a smile, "I really like you. You always manage to surprise me." "Whether you are disappointed or not has nothing to do with me. I just want to know how to get to the Evil Spirit Mountain," Xia Ge called her name, "Guide." The girl shook her head, seeming to sigh. "Lost in the deep sea of floating clouds, not knowing that you are in this mountain." Xia Ge was stunned, and then slowly widened her eyes. Does that mean... that the Double Yi Teleportation Stone did indeed send her to the Evil Spirit Mountain, and this... this is really the Evil Spirit Mountain?! She had this guess before, but she dared not confirm it, because if this was the Evil Spirit Mountain, then where was her senior sister? The girl interrupted Xia Ge's thoughts. "Have I not told you my name yet?" After all, she was not just a guide. Xia Ge was still thinking about the meaning of her previous words, but her expression clearly conveyed four words - "I don't want to know." The girl didn't mind either. "Those who are destined to meet will meet. Although I don't like the weak, fortunately, I don't dislike you." This child was innocent and bright. The girl reached out to Xia Ge, still with her hand wrapped in heavy fabric, like the three unchanging mists, completely unable to see the true face of Lushan.
"The clouds are high and the wind is cold, the mountains are low and not cold." The girl's voice was light, "Even weak and foolish people, in order to achieve their wishes, must learn to accept unknown kindness and strength."

This sentence means...

Xia Ge's heart moved and he held her hand.

As soon as he held it, Xia Ge was stunned because he couldn't feel any warmth from her hand.

Not cold, not hot, no temperature difference.

It was like holding a piece of cloth.

The girl paused and suddenly said, "After so many years, I finally met someone...who is somewhat likable."

If you don't understand what she's saying, just pretend you didn't hear it. Xia Ge said, "My name is Xia Ge."

"A very nice name," the girl said, "My name is Zhen Hun."

Zhen Hun?!

Xia Ge's pupils suddenly shrank!

The next moment, the system prompt sounded in his ear.

[Ding! Congratulations to the host for completing the task "Yi Mei, Zhen Hun Wu Shuang"!]

[Ding! Congratulations to the host for advancing!]

[Reward: 1000 points!]

[Please go to the skill panel to select and view the new skill.]

The wind whistled, his hand was tightly held and he couldn't break free. The cloak slowly unraveled into strips and then coiled around Xia Ge like a snake, finally turning into a black dress.

The long sleeves were slightly gathered, with a narrow seam at the cuff, embroidered with delicate snow-white cloud patterns on both sides. A black belt was slightly tightened around his slender waist, and the belt was long, tied on the right side after being tied around the waist, leaving two long black ribbons. The tails of the ribbons were also embroidered with exquisite and gorgeous cloud patterns, which changed unpredictably. The belt also outlined the girl's slender and soft figure.

Xia Ge felt light and fluttery all over, as if he could fly on clouds and move with the wind.

This was the legendary Zhen Hun Wu Shuang.

The girl just now was the soul of Yi Mei.
The system, which had been pretending to be dead, suddenly spoke up: "Ah, congratulations, congratulations! It's wonderful news!"

Xia Ge's expression was numb. "Zhen Hun?"

The system replied, "Yes, that's right."

Legend has it that when Zhen Hun was born, the world shook and countless people rushed forward. But in the end, Xia Ge had managed to obtain it in a rather confusing manner.

And the process was not very pleasant.

Wait a minute!

If Zhen Hun is here, then the land beneath her feet must be Evil Spirit Mountain!!

Evil Spirit Mountain is an endless mountain range that suppresses countless evil spirits and restless ghosts that once caused havoc in the world. The ancient Zhen Hun has guarded this place for five hundred years to maintain peace in all directions.

But five hundred years of time have buried everything in dust. People coveted the power, strength, and reputation that the ancient Zhen Hun could give them. Combined with the wrong information from the demonic cult, the truth has gradually been buried. Most people only know that Evil Spirit Mountain has the ancient Zhen Hun, but few know what it is used for.

Major sects that know part of the truth, such as the Lingxi Peak, have released the truth, but few care about the truth. Those who want power are like fish in troubled waters. All the sects can do is to send people to guard against Zhen Hun's loss and prevent the evil spirits from emerging and causing chaos in the world.

When Xia Ge had just returned from the River of Time, the outskirts of Evil Spirit Mountain were already in ruins.

The fierce beasts summoned by Su Chan rushed down the mountain, forming a tide of beasts. The defense of Gu Peijiu's Tianzhu Ling was impregnable under the tide, but the tide was easy to defend and hard to attack.

Some people saw that the tide was stable under Gu Peijiu's defense, so many began to covet the ancient Zhen Hun in Evil Spirit Mountain. Finally, after the tide had subsided a bit, someone broke through Gu Peijiu's defense and rushed straight towards the depression in Evil Spirit Mountain!

The Evil Spirit Mountain range is towering and undulating, with only a few low points. They were now in one of these low points, and according to legend, Zhen Hun was in the basin surrounded by the mountain range. As long as they went in, they might be able to take Zhen Hun!

Gu Peijiu's pupils contracted slightly. This person had broken through the defense from the inside, and the hungry wild beasts immediately rushed in when they saw an opportunity!

"Damn it—"

"Who—"

But three or four wild beasts also broke through the barrier. Gu Peijiu focused her mind and calmly shook her Tianzhu Ling to repair the gap in the barrier. However, the beasts rampaged inside the barrier, with fur like steel and targets in mind. They pounced on a thin and weak magic cultivator, who didn't even have time to cast a small fireball before his neck was bitten off!

"Roar—"

Blood splattered, and it was bloody and cruel. Several disciples who had come here with their fellow sect brothers were so scared that they even wet their pants. Some disciples panicked and ran towards the outside, and two fools even rushed straight out!
"地级, it's a ground-level beast!"

Someone shouted, "The ground-level beasts are eating people! We can't beat them!"

Gu Peijiu's gaze turned cold. Ground-level beasts? These beasts were barely at the yellow level! Who was spreading rumors and causing trouble?!

However, in the next moment, a "ground-level" pressure suddenly emanated from the beasts!

The pressure of the beasts was filled with disharmony.

Gu Peijiu's pupils contracted. Who was it?!

Originally, these were beasts that could easily be suppressed by humans, but now they were suddenly elevated to a higher level.

With the beast tide attacking from outside and the "ground-level" beasts inside, many people couldn't see the source of the chaos. The shout of "ground-level beast" combined with the almost convincing and terrifying ground-level pressure caused a strange panic among the people!

"Xuan-level?!"

"Oh my god!! Run away!"

"Since we have to leave anyway, why not take this opportunity to enter the Evil Spirit Mountain from here!"

Everyone responded to the call.

Many people rushed out of the barrier, creating more gaps and allowing more beasts to rush in!

One had to admit that many times, it wasn't the beasts that were scary, but the people who were defeated by fear.

Some people cursed, "You're looking for death, go ahead! So many people can't even handle a ground-level beast, what are you eating for?!"

"Don't mess up the barrier--"

"Ah--they're coming in again!!"

The chaos was rampant, with many people tearing the barrier and rushing out, while others desperately squeezed in. In the midst of the chaos, the "ground-level" pressure quietly disappeared. Gu Peijiu was caught in the chaos, and the protection of the Tianzhu Ling turned into a useless item. The wild roar of the beasts filled the air!

It was useless.

As a disciple of the Lingxi Peak, Gu Peijiu had no obligation to protect them. She put away the Tianzhu Ling, and the beast tide rushed towards her. The smell of blood in the air made people anxious. Everyone tried their best, with various spiritual weapons and lights flying around. Those who were incapable became food for the beasts. The cruelty of the law of the jungle was fully demonstrated here.

The blood of beasts and humans mixed together, stimulating the beasts' ferocious nature even more.
Gu Peijiu's figure was as elusive as the wind, dodging the wild beasts that brushed past her. Even the strongest of beasts could not touch even a corner of her clothes.

She looked on coldly as a person fell to the ground and had their leg bitten off by the savage beasts. Several different kinds of beasts rushed over and devoured the person, accompanied by a mournful cry. It was bloody and cruel.

She knew this person, the one who had rushed out and let the beasts break through the Tianzhu Curtain.

Gu Peijiu didn't move, watching him be devoured by the beasts from a distance.

The beasts tasted the sweetness of human blood and, biting a human bone, set their sights on Gu Peijiu.

Slowly, their bloodstained fangs were revealed.

Gu Peijiu paid no attention and just glanced at it coldly.

The bloody scenes, the ugly and twisted human nature.

Ugly... and beautiful.

For some reason, Gu Peijiu suddenly thought of the person who should be in Danfeng.

These things shouldn't be in the beautiful eyes of that person.

Even though she could occasionally see a maturity beyond a child's in the person's playful eyes.

But what did that matter?

Outside, the wind and rain were noisy, and she always had the ability to protect her from worry.

With her around, no one could harm her.

- Whether she... accepts it or not.

If she accepts it, so what? If she doesn't, what can she do?

Suddenly, she felt a little angry.

"Growl..."

The wild beast that bared its teeth at Gu Peijiu trembled slightly when it met her gaze. Feeling a chill enveloping its body, it instinctively retreated and put down the sweet human bone, letting out a few begging cries before slowly backing away.
Lu Qie was a powerless alchemist who had finally managed to reach Gu Peijiu's side with the protection of Ye Ze, who had rushed to her aid amidst the beasts' siege. Upon arriving, Lu Qie was dumbfounded by what she saw.

"Wow... Senior Sister is amazing..."

The coldness in Gu Peijiu's eyes slightly dissipated, and she didn't know why she was angry. She just thought that if she were rejected—

If that person were to say... if she were to say sorry, I can't.

Gu Peijiu suddenly wished that the battle at the Evil Spirit Mountain would drag on a little longer, even longer.

Although every moment, she would faintly recall that person's slender eyebrows, cat-like eyes, soft and sweet lips, fair and beautiful yet somewhat thin hands, and although every moment, she would unintentionally recall the sweet taste she had experienced, the lingering scent between their breaths, and her soft and slender waist, even though—

Even though, she might be rejected.

Rejected mercilessly, coldly.

"Ugh—"

The beasts within a hundred-mile radius suddenly seemed to have been threatened, and their ferocious momentum suddenly weakened. They crouched on the ground, trembling, and scattered.

The people who were fighting the beasts were stunned, not understanding what had happened, but no matter what, they knew what they had to do—

Go to the Evil Spirit Mountain Basin!

Several high-level magic cultivators and some ranked individuals had already passed through the unremarkable beast tide and were walking at the front. Most of the people who were trapped by the beasts quickly broke free and chased after them as the beasts inexplicably weakened.

The charm of a seductive appearance is always more attractive than life itself.

Everyone fantasized about being the one to pick up the pieces.

Perhaps others didn't know what had happened or why the beast tide had retreated, but Lu Qie and Ye Ze, who were closest to Gu Peijiu, vaguely understood.

It was the stern pressure that Gu Peijiu had released, which had made the group of beasts tremble with fear.

"... Senior Sister seems to be thinking about something and is immersed in it. Moreover, she is angry while thinking, and she doesn't even realize that she's leaking her anger," Lu Qie cautiously called out to Gu Peijiu. "Um, everyone has gone ahead. We..."

Gu Peijiu paused for a moment, her beautiful black pupils looking indifferent as she glanced at Lu Qie. "Let's go."

The cold and melancholic pressure suddenly dissipated, and Gu Peijiu's face showed no expression, as if she were not the one who had used her unintentional pressure to force back the raging beast tide.
Ye Zewang looked at Gu Peijiu and wanted to ask her if Xia Wuyin had also come. But when he thought of the charming girl who played the flute under the moonlight, he moved his lips but didn't say anything.

A few people followed the crowd.

Lu Qie had no self-protection ability, but because of his excellent alchemy skills, he was able to quickly make medicine, so he was brought along.

"Hey, didn't they say a beautiful junior sister also came? How come I didn't see her on the way?"

Feeling that Gu Peijiu was not in a good mood, even though it was difficult to be happy in the bloody and limb-filled mountain forest, Lu Qie felt that life should be enjoyed in a timely manner. Gossiping occasionally could liven up the atmosphere and be beneficial to physical and mental health.

So his specialty was talking a lot.

Meanwhile, Gu Peijiu had just repelled the beast tide and was thinking about Xia Ge, who had actually run to the Evil Spirit Mountain to have fun. Of course, Gu Peijiu didn't know that. She was thinking about how to face her after everything was over, thinking about all the possible answers she might receive. Gu Peijiu, who usually had a calm mind, was feeling a bit restless and naturally ignored Lu Qie's chatter.

She didn't even bother to make a facial expression.

What should she do?

What if she was rejected?

She didn't want to force her.

But she couldn't let go either.

And Ye Ze had experienced the awkwardness of his brother possibly turning into a woman, and then thought of Xia Wuyin, who seemed to be 80% similar to Qin Yue, plus the shadow of Xia Wuyin he had just seen...

He was also feeling restless and didn't even bother with Lu Qie's chatter about the "pretty junior sister."

No one paid attention to him.

Lu Qie touched his nose and felt that it was better if he didn't speak. The air seemed even more awkward when he talked.

But... that little junior sister named Mao Qing, he only saw her twice in the restaurant and didn't see her just now... could she have been eaten by a wild beast?!

It shouldn't be, she was so pretty, it would be a shame if she was eaten.

Lu Qie, who couldn't even protect himself, even began to worry about others.

As they walked down the path, they also met several disciples from the Lingxi Peak. As soon as those disciples saw Gu Peijiu, they immediately felt like they had found their backbone and followed along. The oppressive and depressing atmosphere was finally broken, and Lu Qie finally freed his mouth and began to exchange experiences with the new Lingxi Peak companions.

Meanwhile, Mao Qing, the one who was worrying Lu Qie, or rather, the one who started all of this, was currently biting on round grapes and watching a thrilling battle between humans and the beast tide from the top of the highest peak in the Evil Spirit Mountain.
She stood up slowly, her red dress fluttering in the wind.

Behind Su Chan knelt a man whose arm had been bitten off by a wild beast. Upon closer inspection, his clothes were tattered and torn from the marks of the beast's attack, but the arm that had been ripped off was not even bleeding.

If Gu Peijiu were here, she would have sensed the aura of a wild beast emanating from the man's body. He was the originator of the phrase "earth-level wild beast."

He was a puppet that had been modified with an earth-level wild beast crystal and stored with a human soul.

"You've done well," Su Chan said, crushing a grape and savoring the sweet juice that flowed down her throat like lost love. She closed her eyes in contentment. "You can go back now. When you get back, have someone fix your arm."

"Thank you, Master Su," the man said before leaving.

The surroundings seemed to have quieted down significantly.

Su Chan looked down at everything, watching the group of people slowly enter deeper into the Evil Spirit Mountain Range like ants. The Evil Spirit Mountain Range was winding and overlapping, filled with confusing mazes and formations, as well as various ferocious beasts. It was impossible to reach the enclosed basin and their destination by recklessly charging forward.

She took out a map that had been carefully pieced together after being summoned by the Evil Spirit Mountain. After being summoned, the contents on the map had changed to show the internal structure of the Evil Spirit Mountain Range.

It clearly displayed all the structures and formations in the Evil Spirit Mountain Range. The mountains on the map were surrounded by a layer of pale white light, with a symbol next to it representing the range of territory that the Clothes Charm Soul was guarding in the Evil Spirit Mountain.

Underneath this winding land, the most ferocious evil spirits in the world were suppressed. In the past, these evil ghosts represented an era, a time when ghosts and demons were everywhere and evil spirits surged at all times. People lived in constant fear of ghosts. They ate to survive, indulged in pleasures, or even hid in cellars all day because no one knew when the evil ghost tide would descend upon them.

At that time, although the sky was blue, the terror within it was no less than that of the night.

Because during the day, the cruel appearance of evil spirits devouring people made it clear what hell on earth was like.

...It was truly a golden age of ghosts.

That era was known as the Night of a Hundred Ghosts.
Living in the shadow of ghosts and demons, it was a dark era.

The short and terrifying era, known as the era of Xia Wushuang, was ended by her own hands at Wuyi Mountain.

Su Chan's beautiful and slender fingers pressed on the map, lightly circling around the edge of the pale white light, and the area covered by the light almost contained the entire Evil Spirit Mountain. It was evident how powerful the Town Soul energy was, but it was nothing.

Her fingertips slowly landed on the basin at the center of the map, which was protected by numerous mountains. Near the basin, a mountain was depicted in bright red on the map, with a small golden array on top.

The small array was only the size of a fingernail and was covered by the pale white light at the top of the red mountain. It slowly rotated, seeming to guard something.

This was the Heavenly Seal that sealed the evil spirits.

Town Soul energy could soothe and suppress evil spirits, but the evil spirits that had been rampant on the continent for so many years, although it was difficult to say if they were at the level of divine souls, there were still many at the level of demigods. Five hundred years was not a short time, and it was impossible to deal with them just by relying on Town Soul energy and a spiritual mountain.

Therefore, Xia Wushuang used her own blood to create this Heavenly Seal to seal the evil spirits.

Under her skillful techniques, the Evil Spirit Mountain would instinctively stop at the spiritual veins during its wandering, absorbing the spiritual energy of the veins and transforming it into spiritual power to supply this seal, ensuring the suppression of the evil spirits.

Triple protection, a layer of spiritual mountain, a layer of seal, and finally, Town Soul.

Town Soul was responsible for guarding this seal and releasing the energy of soothing souls to comfort the spirits, allowing the restless souls to rest.

Among these three layers, as long as the crucial seal was torn apart, whether it was the spiritual mountain or the Town Soul, they would be nothing more than paper tigers that could be easily destroyed. There was nothing to be concerned about.

Su Chan lightly stroked the small golden seal, her smile both enchanting and cold.

Tearing apart the seal, releasing the evil spirits, and causing suffering to living beings, was not something to be tolerated.

For a moment, Su Chan thought of a very distant past.

She used to be the descendant of humans and gods, half-god and half-human, born in the mortal world and raised in the Cloud City.

When some people heard that she had the blood of gods, they worshipped her as a mortal god, but at that time, the gods did not recognize her as she had impure blood.

Those who believed in her worshipped her, while those who detested her cursed her. Even the faith of mortals was mixed with both blessings and desires for evil. She accepted everything without discrimination, without the concept of good and evil or right and wrong. Half of her divine soul remained pure and untainted, but after doing bad things for too long, the other half of her human soul fell into darkness and became a demon.

Her mother died early, and her father, the god, did not recognize her bloodline, so she had no name and no one taught her about right and wrong.

Some people called her the goddess of fortune, while others called her a calamity.
She once saved an old man who was about to freeze to death on the roadside, and also cursed a young child to be blind and deaf.

Many years later, her spirit was pure and kind, while her human soul was evil and corrupt. With every desire, there would be bloodshed and chaos. Her thoughts could make her a benevolent god or a malevolent one.

Until the gods condemned her for allowing her followers to cause harm, heavy chains bound her body, and she was tortured in a windowless dungeon. She was almost driven insane, but she didn't understand what she had done wrong.

If someone believed in her, she would help them, was that wrong?

Wasn't that her duty?

She didn't understand.

With chains binding her, what was she thinking at her most painful moment?

Su Chan was lost in thought, thinking that everyone was suffering.

A good person who does something bad cannot be forgiven, while a bad person who does something good is praised.

This world is so strange.

So why did she have to be a benevolent god for the good side?

Why not be a malevolent one? As a malevolent god, she could rightfully retaliate against everyone and make them taste the bitterness of suffering. She could make all the gods fall from their pedestals, cause storms to flood the land, let plagues ravage the world, let tyrants rule everything, and make everyone unhappy. She could make everyone feel her pain.

Because she was a malevolent god, it was natural, and no one could say she was wrong.

External desires cannot corrupt the divine spirit. The only things that can make a god fall are faith and loneliness, besides the gods themselves.

She could feel that the heavens cursed the gods and hoped for their demise.

So she followed the will of the heavens and prayed for the twilight of the gods.

If successful, it would have a tremendous impact, and she would become a pure malevolent god.

At that moment, she thought she was really going to become a malevolent god.
Until one day.

Until the person arrived, their hand slightly cool, their voice clear and gentle with a hint of confusion.

"Are you sick?"

Her forehead was burning, she couldn't see the person clearly, the darkness of desire and instinct consuming her pure soul, her mind in disarray, she couldn't see this person with the cool hand.

It was...a person.

A...follower.

"Are you my follower?" Her voice hoarse, speaking in an ancient godly tone, "I am a calamity..."

I am a calamity, I am powerful, I can make the sea dry up, I can make the stars overturn, following the will of heaven, I can even bring about the twilight of the gods -

If you are my follower, I can fulfill all your wicked desires.

"You are sick." She heard the person say, "Are you in pain?"

The heavy chains were removed.

She was held in the arms of this person like a child, her tone strange but without any malice, she spoke to herself, "Can gods get sick too?"

She knew she was a god, but unlike mortals, she didn't eagerly express her own kind or wicked desires.

The embrace of this person was warm.

Wandering the world, able to make the earth dry up, able to make the stars overturn, determined to bring calamity to one side, the calamity god suddenly felt like she was nothing.

Being a god was very lonely.

The gods she had met didn't acknowledge her, her followers only cared about what they could get from her.

No one cared if she was sick.

A qualified god wouldn't get sick, she heard her hoarse voice say, "I'm not."

She was a god, the most powerful god, not a half-god with human blood and filth.

The other person clearly didn't understand her language.
Only the priest could understand her words. Unlike the newly born gods, she had lived for a long time and had been imprisoned in the Cloud City Prison for a long time. She knew the oldest language of the gods and could also understand human language, but no one had taught her how to speak it.

She was also too lazy to learn.

Suddenly, the man stood up, towering over her.

The warmth of his embrace disappeared, and the wind became cold.

Instinctively, she reached out to grab his clothes, but as soon as she realized what she was doing, she let go.
