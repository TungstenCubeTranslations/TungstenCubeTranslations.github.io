The river of time can only be seen by gods and certain individuals.

Xia Wushuang couldn't naturally see the river of time, but in front of two simple graves, she saw a god's soul that was about to be completely demonized.

The soul was swaying and unstable, as if it could dissipate at any moment, but it was still demonizing and the situation was extremely bad.

However, no matter how bad things were, a starved camel is still bigger than a horse, and a demonized god's soul is not something Xia Wushuang can deal with.

"..." This is really awkward.

Xia Wushuang originally wanted to leave, but it had already seen her.

She instinctively pulled out her bone flute and assumed a defensive posture. "Hey, don't come over, I..."

"...You."

But it spoke, with a shallow voice and a pitch-black soul like ink. It gazed at her and spoke softly, "Have you come back?"

The originally pitch-black soul slowly faded, but the demonic aura lingered.

It was like it had been redeemed.

Xia Wushuang was goosebumped by the sight. The soul that was demonizing was losing its mind and would slowly only remember its obsession. This was normal.

But saying "have you come back" to her was definitely not normal. Upon careful thought, it was even a bit terrifying!

"You...you must have mistaken me for someone else," Xia Wushuang rubbed her goosebumps and thought for a moment. Due to the difference in strength, she asked kindly, "Who are you looking for?"

After all, it was a god's soul. Ordinary god's souls were powerless, but the power of a demonized god's soul would increase exponentially.

She wasn't weak, but there was no need to look for trouble.

"I'm looking for you," it said.

Xia Wushuang: "..."

Xia Wushuang had just thought of saying something to express her feelings when the god's soul stared at her for a while and suddenly said, "Not you."

Xia Wushuang: "..."

Of course it wasn't her! But if it wasn't her, then it was easy to deal with. They could just part ways amicably.
Xia Wushuang turned around: "If that's not the case, then I'll leave first, haha."

Shenhun didn't chase after her and quietly stayed by the tombstone, seeming disappointed. The black mist around her began to swirl again.

Her soul was in danger of dispersing.

Xia Wushuang took a few steps, hesitated for a moment, and then sneaked back.

Just to take a look, she comforted herself. After all, it wouldn't hurt to take a look. If she didn't do anything, the corrupted Shenhun would harm the nearby people, and in the end, someone would have to clean up the mess. Plus...

She was kind of good-looking.

Xia Wushuang silently knocked her head.

Although Shenhun's consciousness was a bit chaotic, she was still very sensitive. Xia Wushuang's sneaky actions were discovered in just a few minutes.

When Xia Wushuang was caught, she awkwardly tried to make small talk: "So, um...what are you doing here?"

...She felt like it was a stupid question. Didn't Shenhun already say she was looking for someone?

When facing Xia Wushuang, Shenhun seemed to be particularly patient. She just looked at her as if she was looking at someone else.

She gently replied, "I'm looking for someone."

Xia Wushuang tried to sound natural: "Did you find them?"

Of course not, otherwise she wouldn't still be here.

Shenhun shook her head, "No, I couldn't find them."

Xia Wushuang's mind started racing. "...If you wait here, you definitely won't find them. Why don't we go out and look for them?"

Shenhun didn't say anything.

Xia Wushuang noticed how fragile and scattered her soul was, as if it could disappear at any moment. She hesitated for a moment and asked, "Do you want to be resurrected?"

Shenhun looked at her but still didn't say anything.

Xia Wushuang asked, "I've been researching resurrection techniques lately. If I succeed, it would benefit everyone - I mean, I've almost succeeded."

...The resurrection technique, was it the one Xiaoge had done before?
"It was just ruined by her."

Doudou regained her consciousness and asked, "What should we do?"

"Just...put the soul into the puppet, and you can be resurrected," Xia Wushuang said, "It's very simple."

Doudou looked at her.

Perhaps this person had the same soul as Xia Ge, which allowed her to slightly soothe her and alleviate half of the demon energy on her body, giving her a little bit of sanity.

But in order to deceive Xia Ge's eyes before, she pretended to look like she had gone through reincarnation and exploded the puppet, causing great damage to her soul. Now her soul was unstable and could disperse at any moment.

If she were to possess the puppet again... If the puppet were to break, then it would be her death.

Or even if the puppet didn't break, she wouldn't be able to hold on for long.

She really didn't want to accept this.

This person probably didn't know these things.

She should refuse.

But then she heard herself say, "Okay."

She couldn't refuse.

The same eyes as Xia Ge, the same soul as her, like an instinct that tempted the demonized Doudou, allowing her to agree to any request, even if it meant going through fire and water.

Her demonized soul existed for her.

"Really!?" Xia Wushuang was pleasantly surprised and took out the puppet that had been prepared for a long time. "Actually, I've already prepared everything. I just need a soul. There are many people who are about to die, but out of humanitarianism, I don't want to use them as guinea pigs. Hahaha, sorry, I talk too much."

Awkward.

Xia Wushuang scratched her head. "...Because you're already demonized, only this way can slow down your demonization speed. My skills may not be great, but they're still better than others. You can trust me a little bit."

The puppet could indeed slow down her demonization speed, but once she was freed, it would mean even more severe demonization.

But it didn't matter.
Doudou stared at her and asked softly, "If we succeed, can you hold my hand for a moment?"

Xia Wushuang was taken aback.

"...After I turn into that form, can you hold my hand?" Doudou thought she didn't understand, and repeated gently, "Just for a moment."

Could this person also have the warmth of her fingertips?

Xia Wushuang didn't quite understand why she made this request.

She felt that the gaze of this soul looking at her seemed very simple, yet also very complex, very gentle, yet also very indifferent.

She couldn't understand her emotions, but she could agree to her request.

"Sure."

Xia Wushuang's puppet-making skills were unparalleled in the world.

The long hair made of black soul silk, the eyes made of soul beads, the skin made of Tian Shan white clay, and the bones made of ten thousand bone jade, every corner could be called perfect.

Doudou moved her arms and legs silently, without any sound, as light as a swallow, as if she were a real person.

Not a single creaking sound.

Doudou said, "Very good."

Xia Wushuang rubbed her nose, "I only have this much skill, haha."

Suddenly, her hand was held.

Xia Wushuang was startled.

Doudou looked at her, her voice soft, her black eyes gentle, "My name is Doudou."

Although her hand was cold, Xia Wushuang's heart skipped a beat, "...Doudou."

Xia Wushuang could see a girl in a peach blossom, and it frightened Chu Shi. She learned that Doudou, the puppet, was Xia Wushuang's masterpiece, which was also very surprising.

Xia Wushuang took Doudou and Chu Shi back to Lingxi Peak together.

At that time, Lingxi Peak was still just a bandit's den, of course, it was a bandit's den with the courage to snatch the princess of the current dynasty.
Chu Shi suggested using resurrection magic on a dying soldier, and Xia Wushuang agreed to the request. Originally, the princess who was supposed to marry outside was kidnapped by bandits, and the emperor was furious, often sending troops to attack the Lingxi Mountain. However, there were many strange people in the mountain stronghold, and coupled with the hidden troops in the stronghold, it was naturally difficult to conquer.

In order to make enough puppets, Xia Wushuang was also busy, and when she realized that she hadn't seen Dou Dou for a long time, she went to look for her, only to find that her soul was gone, leaving only an exquisite empty shell.

Although she had expected that the fragile soul could not last long, Xia Wushuang did not expect it to be so fast.

Xia Wushuang didn't know what she was feeling, and subconsciously squeezed the hand that Dou Dou had held before.

...a hand that had been touched by Dou Dou before.

It was cold.

She picked up the puppet, but saw it shake a few times, opened its mouth, and a black stone fell out of its mouth.

The stone was black but translucent, like pure black crystal, with a faint soul breath on it.

Xia Wushuang was stunned for a moment, picked up the stone, and felt a warm sensation in her hand. In an instant, she felt full of longing and instinctive attachment.

Soul stone.

Only the most tenacious and sincere soul with the strongest obsession can condense into a soul stone at the last moment of the soul's flight and scattering.

This is an invaluable treasure that is difficult to find in the world.

"What's wrong?" Chu Shi saw that Xia Wushuang had been absent-minded these days and couldn't help but ask.

Xia Wushuang didn't say anything, just opened her palm.

Chu Shi took a look and saw a black crystal.

"What is this black stone?" Chu Shi asked curiously, "Have you been so absent-minded these days because of this broken stone?"

"This is not a broken stone," Xia Wushuang said, "This is Dou Dou's soul stone."

Chu Shi was surprised: "Soul stone?! Dou Dou's? This..."

Xia Wushuang absent-mindedly responded with a "hmm", but in her mind, she still saw the clear eyes of the semi-demonized soul.

"She said she was looking for someone." Xia Wushuang placed the soul stone in the sun, and the translucent black soul stone reflected the brilliant sunlight, warm and incomparable. "But now, where can she find them?"

Chu Shi thought for a moment and suggested: "You can use it as material for your puppet."
Xia Wushuang was taken aback. "Huh?"

"Aren't you currently making a 'leader'?" Chu Shi said. "You can turn this stone into its eyes."

"Don't joke around like that. Show some respect for the deceased," Xia Wushuang said. "If I turn it into a puppet, it will be with me all the time, and it's not good for the deceased to have to work hard."

"Perhaps for ordinary people, resting in peace is indeed respectful," Chu Shi said.

"But I think for a soul that has been demonized and cannot rest, the greatest respect is to help it achieve its wishes, or to help it on the way to achieving its wishes."

Xia Wushuang was slightly startled.

Chu Shi looked at the soul stone, his eyes slightly deepened. "Do you know what kind of obsession and emotion...what kind of pain and despair one must experience to turn a semi-demonized soul into a soul stone?"

"I don't know," Xia Wushuang paused.

She only knew that soul stones were treasures in the world, and that only souls with sincere and passionate emotions could turn their souls into soul stones. But what Chu Shi said, she really didn't know.

"The power contained in a soul stone is very powerful, let alone the soul of a god. To condense an invisible soul into a tangible stone, it must undergo incredible tempering and pain. Its unfinished obsession must be very important to it. Therefore, it would rather become a stone than be incomplete." Chu Shi closed Xia Wushuang's hand holding the soul stone and looked into her eyes. "Can I think of it this way? She entrusted her power to you, as an exchange, she hopes that one day, you can help her achieve her goals and fulfill her merit."

"But I..." Xia Wushuang said.

The eyes of her first leader were intended to be modeled after her brother.

The eyes of her brother were what she remembered, a little bit of information about the present world.

Xia Wushuang looked at the soul stone in her hand, thinking of the distant world and her brother who needed to be taken care of, feeling a little melancholy.

She wasn't originally called Xia Wushuang, but when she first came to this world, she didn't remember anything, only that her surname was Xia, and she was deceived by the system...

"Um, I can't remember my name."

"Wushuang."

"......?"

"You will be the unparalleled puppeteer of this world in the future!"

"......No, my name is Wushuang?"
"Right! The unparalleled of the current world!"

"..."

Later, she remembered something from the real world, that she had a younger brother and didn't seem to have this name. She went to confront the system -

"Ah, anyway, you can't remember it clearly. Whether it's Xia Wu Shuang or Xia Shuang Wu, it doesn't matter."

Xia Wu Shuang: "..."
