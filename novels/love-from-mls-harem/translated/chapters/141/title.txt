Chapter 140: Under the Rules

Under the rules, everyone had to follow the same procedures. As a translator, I had to adhere to a strict set of guidelines in order to produce a high-quality translation. This meant carefully choosing the right words and ensuring that the meaning of the original text was accurately conveyed in English.

At times, it could be challenging to strike a balance between staying faithful to the original text and making the translation sound natural in English. However, with practice and experience, I had developed a keen sense of when to prioritize one over the other.

Ultimately, my goal was to provide readers with an enjoyable and engaging reading experience, while also staying true to the author's intent. It was a rewarding job, and I took pride in being a bridge between two cultures through the power of language.
