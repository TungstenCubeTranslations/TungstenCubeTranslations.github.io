The icy sword edge was silent, and the killing intent and hatred were contained within the sword intent. The bone-chilling ghost power borrowed from the Ghost Dragon Jade was condensed on the blade. The young man's thin lips were tightly pursed into a line. The Ghost Dragon possessed him, and his pitch-black eyes turned into the same crimson golden dragon pupils as the Ghost Dragon at the moment the sword was about to strike the woman.

Filled with hatred!

But these were not important. What made Qin Yue's heart tremble was that this sword carried sword intent!

The young man had a somewhat immature understanding of sword intent. Upon seeing her, his hatred deepened. Coupled with the power of the Ghost Dragon, he grasped the feeling of a strong person and had a deeper understanding of "sword intent." This sword now seemed to have the power to destroy the world that only a great being could possess!

Qin Yue almost instinctively wanted to avoid it, but the priest was already skilled in spiritual arts. Moreover, with her spiritual power sealed and years of imprisonment, it was almost impossible to avoid this sword full of sword intent!

There was no escape, and death was certain!

"Chirp--"

One second before the sword light was about to strike!

A crimson golden red diamond attacked and collided with the Wenqing sword edge. Tianzhu clashed with Wenqing, and the powerful force of the Ghost Dragon Jade collided with the enchanting power of Tianzhu Ling. The huge spiritual power fluctuations trembled, and the earth shook. With several loud bangs, the mountain prison even felt like it was about to collapse!

Ye Ze knew someone was coming to stop him, but he ignored that person and missed his first attack. He drew his sword to fight again, and with a backhand horizontal sword, he once again slashed towards Qin Yue's neck, his golden pupils carrying a cold and ruthless aura, relentlessly pursuing her!

As long as this person died!

Even if he was punished—even if he died, it didn't matter!

Qin Yue had to die!!

"Clang!"

In front of Qin Yue, someone appeared.

The sword that was about to cut through was held by one hand. Although it was held, the sword trembled in that person's palm, still making the sound of clashing swords. The collision of spiritual power and ghost energy caused terrifying vibrations, and the strong wind swept through the small mountain prison. Gu Peijiu's pitch-black hair was blown by the wind, and her right hand, wrapped in the golden-red Tianzhu Ling, held the sharp blade of the Wenqing sword, her wide sleeves embroidered with maple leaves rustling.

Qin Yue's pupils dilated and then shrank. It took a long time for her to react and realize that she had been saved.

Her heart, which had been lifted, was put back down, but the fear of "almost dying" still lingered in her heart.

The young man never looked at the person who stopped him.

He just stared at Qin Yue, his golden eyes filled with a simple, crazy, and unyielding hatred.

From his eyes, Qin Yue knew...
He won't give up.

As long as he's alive.

"Don't stop me," Ye Ze didn't even look at Gu Peiju, his golden eyes gleaming with a beastly coldness as he stared at Qin Yue, each word almost squeezed out from between his teeth, "She must die!"

"Do you know what you're doing?" Gu Peiju's voice was cold.

"I know," Ye Ze said, "I know what I should do, every day, every moment, every second."

From his family, from that day--

He finally shifted his gaze to Gu Peiju, each word enunciated clearly, "Whoever stops me, I'll step over them!"

Gu Peiju stared at him, and he stared back, their gazes intertwining, one calm and still, the other full of hatred.

Gu Peiju suddenly smiled.

The girl's originally cold and still face, with red lips and ink-black eyes, was truly beautiful when she smiled.

However, Ye Ze didn't have the heart to appreciate it, because under Gu Peiju's smile, the sword in his hand suddenly tightened, and the next moment, the sword that had been firmly in his hand was suddenly hit by a great force and flew out of his hand!

The Wenqing Sword reversed and fell into Gu Peiju's hand, the cold blade resting on Ye Ze's neck.

The girl had already restrained her smile, holding the sword, the Tianzhu Silk loosely scattered in her white hand like a bloody stream, her face expressionless, taking a step forward.

"You said something wrong."

Ye Ze clenched his fist, staring at her fiercely, bloodshot eyes revealing a hint of hatred, "Why..."

"Why are you stopping me!!!"

His eyes were bloodshot, pointing at Qin Yue behind Gu Peiju, "She deserves to die, doesn't she?! She killed so many people!! She--"

"I just said, there's something you said wrong."

Gu Peiju ignored him, repeating herself, the Wenqing Sword in her hand as cold as she was, and Ye Ze hesitated for a second before coldly laughing, his voice hoarse, "I said something wrong? What did I say wrong?! Are you going to say that I did something wrong too?! I shouldn't have--"

"No."
Gu Peijiu held the hilt of her sword and looked at him coldly, word by word.

"My point is."

"You shouldn't have said just now, 'Whoever stops me, I'll step over them'."

Gu Peijiu said.

"You should have said, 'Whoever stops me, I'll step over their corpse'."

Ye Ze stiffened slightly.

Gu Peijiu casually threw her sword on the ground and the Qingqing sword made a crisp sound.

"You did nothing wrong." Gu Peijiu looked at him indifferently, "The only mistake is that I am here, and you cannot kill me."

For a moment, Ye Ze's mind went blank.

Kill her!

Then he picked up his sword and attacked Gu Peijiu like a madman!

However, every move was countered. Although he had the powerful strength of the Ghost Dragon Jade, it was obvious that Ye Ze, who had never come into contact with ghost energy, could not accurately use these abilities. He could only rely on his previous understanding of sword intent and brute force, which was naturally countered by Gu Peijiu.

"Clang-"

The Qingqing sword was taken away again. Ye Ze's face turned pale, and he stared at Gu Peijiu with hatred in his eyes.

Gu Peijiu looked at the slightly pale teenager in front of her.

"Do you want to kill her?"

Hatred is not wrong.

Gu Peijiu asked.

Ye Ze clenched his fists and said nothing.

Revenge is not wrong either.

It's just that...
Gu Peijiu said lightly, "Now, you're not capable enough."

Qin Yue was captured and imprisoned in the Sword Prison, but not killed for a reason.

She had her own group of loyal followers in the shadows, and if she died, the shadow group would retaliate in a suicidal frenzy.

Rather than facing unpredictable consequences, it was better to keep her restrained here.

This was the decision made by the 【Rank】 after discussion.

"I'm not capable enough? Why not?!" Ye Ze's face turned pale, and he hoarsely said, "She's here, and I want to kill her for revenge! It's that simple, why can't I?!! Why can't I?!"

"You're not capable enough." Gu Peijiu didn't explain further. Seeing the despair in the boy's eyes, she paused for a moment and then said coldly, "This is the rule."

Moreover, taking up a butcher's knife to seek revenge would only lead to an endless cycle of revenge.

"Ah!!!" The boy was in extreme pain. His enemy, who had killed his parents, was right in front of him, but he was helpless -

Why?!

Why was he being stopped?!

The rules? The rules!?

Those who ignore the rules are protected by the rules, while those who are restricted by the rules are crushed by them?!

Was this person mocking him?!

Was this damn world mocking him?!!

Gu Peijiu silently looked at him, not stopping him. After a while, when he had finished venting, she said, "You can go, I'll pretend I didn't see you."

Qin Yue was silent behind him, looking at the boy with tears in his eyes, her eyes inscrutable.

Suddenly, Ye Ze looked up and stared at Qin Yue, the fading power of the Ghost Dragon causing his golden eyes to slowly fade away, black and gold intermingling, full of demonic energy.

Qin Yue's pupils slightly contracted! The next moment, she tightly gripped the bell.

"The rules, huh."
The trembling young man slowly stood up, lifting his eyes to look at Gu Peiju. A hint of madness appeared on his pale face as he slightly curved his lips, which were previously tightly pursed.

He murmured, "I understand."

Rules?

Ha, rules.

Xia Ge secretly followed Xiao Xiangsi and sneaked into Jianfeng. She followed Xiao Xiangsi, turning left and right, passing through a persimmon forest and a thorn forest, and finally arrived in front of the mountain prison.

"Huh? There's such a place in Jianfeng. I've never been here before," Xia Ge said as she pushed aside the thorn bushes. She was shocked by the sight in front of her.

There were guards lying around, rocks rolling down and breaking apart, and mountain dust flying around, as if they had just experienced a partial earthquake.

"Wow..." Xia Ge was amazed. "This prison break feels so familiar..."

She approached and found that the prison door was wide open, and the candles that should have been lit on both sides of the passage were all extinguished, leaving it pitch black.

But this did not trouble Xia Ge, who had been washed by Jiaoxue's blood. She could clearly see the path paved with bluestone slabs inside.

"Is Senior Sister really inside? Are you not tricking me?" Xia Ge grabbed Xiao Xiangsi in suspicion.

"What else would she be doing here?" the system replied.

Xia Ge: "..."

Xiao Xiangsi shook her tail and made an "absolutely" gesture.

Just as Xia Ge was about to enter, she suddenly heard footsteps coming from inside.

Startled, she immediately used her Ghostly Shadow technique, hiding behind the thorn bushes and cautiously poking half of her head out to look outside.

Who was coming out? Was it really a prison break? Or was it Senior Sister?
As she was wondering, she saw a dark cell opening, and a young man slowly came out.

His steps were slow and unsteady, with a grimy face. To put it bluntly, he looked like a defeated rooster.

Xia Ge craned her neck to see who this defeated rooster was.

But the other person was obviously very sensitive to his surroundings. Almost as soon as she stuck her head out, the man turned his head, and his cold eyes met her suspicious gaze.

Recognizing him, Ye Ze's hidden weapon paused for a moment before he put it away, feeling exhausted both physically and mentally.

Since she had been discovered, there was no need to hide anymore. Xia Ge popped her head out, smiling and trying to make the atmosphere more natural. "Hey, Brother Ye, are you here for a night tour? The scenery is quite good."

Ye Ze stood in front of a group of guards, his face expressionless as he looked at her.

As Xia Ge continued to smile, she felt like she couldn't keep it up. Finally, she tugged at the corners of her mouth and said, "Um... forgive me for being presumptuous, Brother Ye, but are you... here to rob the prison?"

Ye Ze tugged at the corners of his mouth, his pupils devoid of stars and moons.

"I'm not here to rob the prison."

Xia Ge hadn't even had a chance to relax before Ye Ze's next words made her tense up again.

"I just want to kill someone."
