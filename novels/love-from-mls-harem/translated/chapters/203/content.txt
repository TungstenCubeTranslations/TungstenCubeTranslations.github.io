"What has Little Priestess been busy with these days?"

The girl in red lay quietly in her rocking chair, half-closing her eyes. "Why does she seem so well-behaved?"

No causing trouble, no breaking things, no complaining about this or that, no staying out all night, and not even finding pleasure... no, finding trouble.

As time passed, Su Chan also became somewhat uncomfortable.

"Little Priestess has been with Lady Ye these past few days," Qin Yue said.

"..."

Su Chan looked a little unhappy, "Why didn't she come to see me?"

Qin Yue: "..."

Why should she come to see you!!

= =

"The tea tastes good, try it."

The woman wore half a mask and her black hair was tied up with a green pearl flower hairpin. She looked gentle.

On the small stone table under the grapevine, there was a delicate purple clay tea set.

Xia Ge didn't know how to drink tea very well, and now she looked at the exquisite small tea bowl in front of her, "It would be nice if there was wine."

"Don't talk about wine while drinking tea," Lady Ye scolded her.

Xia Ge smiled, "I'm sorry, I'm not very good at drinking tea."

As she spoke, she still picked up the tea bowl and took a sip.

It was slightly bitter at first, but then it became rich and fragrant. As the bitter tea entered her throat, a faint sweetness lingered on her tongue.

Xia Ge put down the tea bowl.

Lady Ye smiled slightly, "How does it feel?"

Xia Ge said, "...I used to think tea was just bitter and astringent... Lady Ye, this is good tea."
Madam Ye shook her head. "Just plain tea."

Then she sighed, "Perhaps... it's not about the tea, but the heart."

Xia Ge remained silent.

The weather was beautiful today, and Bairen had nothing to do, so he took Mao Qing out to relax. Madam Ye did not stop them, so Xia Ge and her sat down and drank tea together.

The two fell into silence.

"That day when you came, I observed that you had some intention to leave," Madam Ye lightly sipped her tea and broke the silence, her voice gentle. "... But now that I observe you again, I see nothing of the sort."

"Has something happened?"

Xia Ge realized.

She didn't expect Madam Ye to have already noticed her desire to leave when they first met Mao Qing here that night.

No wonder she's a deep-seated lady who has lived for decades longer than her. Even if she had lost all her memories, she still had the intelligence and wisdom of a high-born lady.

"I feel..." Xia Ge hesitated, then fell silent.

"What's troubling you?" Madam Ye put down her tea cup.

Xia Ge was caught off guard.

Since she came back that day and questioned Su Chan, she suddenly remembered that scene - the broken mask, the pale and blood-stained cheeks, and the indifferent face in the pitch-black pupils.

Indifferent, unlike herself.

But that's not the scariest part.

The scariest part is that she has no memory of this period.

She even hastily changed the subject, "... Madam, do you... miss your son?"

Madam Ye was slightly startled, but she probably understood that Xia Ge didn't want to talk about this topic. She picked up her tea cup and said, "Of course, I miss him."
"... " Xia Ge lowered her head slightly, " ... Sorry, Madam."

Madam Ye looked at her, somewhat puzzled as to why she suddenly apologized.

"I... I know him," Xia Ge heard herself say, "I..."

Her voice trailed off.

The sound of the exquisite purple clay tea cup hitting the ground was clear and audible.

With a shattered sound, Madam Ye stood still as scalding hot tea splashed onto her body, without any reaction. She just stood up, slightly widened her eyes, and looked at Xia Ge, "... You know him?"

Xia Ge hurriedly said, "Please don't get excited."

Madam Ye asked, "Is he doing well?"

"He thought you had passed away... so he's been having a hard time."

The delicate embroidered edge of Madam Ye's shoe was the shattered tea cup. She stood still, not knowing what she was thinking.

"..."

Xia Ge said, "I think... I should tell him you're here, but I've done some things that I'm sorry for you both."

"I don't know what to do that's right."

So in the end, she could only follow her own heart and the most instinctive idea.

Madam Ye seemed to have come back to her senses, looking at her with a complicated expression.

"... You don't have to tell him," Madam Ye said, "I'm here... you don't have to tell him."

After a pause, she apologized again, "I'll go change my clothes first."

Madam Ye went to change her clothes.

Xia Ge was a little puzzled by Madam Ye's words. Shouldn't a reunion between mother and son be the best?

"..." Madam Ye sighed lightly, "It's the lonely eagle that can fly higher."
Xia Ge was a little stunned. "But you..."

"I said this sentence following my heart as well," Madam Ye sat back down, her voice calm. "Although the reunion of mother and son is touching, I cannot provide him with any protection right now."

"...," Xia Ge didn't quite understand the depth of this motherly love.

Seeing Xia Ge's confusion, Madam Ye sighed lightly and took off her mask on the right side.

Xia Ge's eyes widened as she saw it.

Half of her face was beautiful as jade, while the other half was a cold machine, with bulging eyes and complex metal mechanisms that were particularly frightening.

She quickly put her mask back on and said in a calm voice, "From the moment I opened my eyes again, I was destined to be different from your kind."

"Although I cannot provide him with protection, I also do not want to bring him criticism," Madam Ye lowered her eyelashes. "That's just how it is."

Xia Ge remained silent.

"So don't worry about it," Madam Ye said. "Life here is good and quiet."

She looked at Xia Ge. "And... I can also feel that there is a complicated bond between us."

Xia Ge looked at her.

"Perhaps..." Madam Ye paused, her gaze softening. "But I can feel that you are a very good girl."

Xia Ge said, "...Maybe I'm not what you imagine me to be."

Madam Ye smiled slightly, very gentle. "But I have always only believed in my own feelings."

After a pause, she smiled again. "Moreover, as Ah Qing often says, people always have their reasons for doing things."

Xia Ge responded readily, "But not many people will listen."

"That's why I often tell her," Madam Ye said, "if you have any reasons, you can tell me."
Xia Ge was slightly taken aback.

"Although there is nothing I can do," Madame Ye said, "but speaking out will make it easier, right?"

"And I believe you are a good child."

Xia Ge left the courtyard feeling restless.

The system asked cautiously, "What's wrong with you?"

Xia Ge muttered to herself, "I just feel...it's very unfair."

The system said, "There's nothing fair in this world. Even buying a cabbage in the market, you might get less weight than you paid for."

Xia Ge turned a corner and said, "Shut up."

She went to find Su Chan.

Su Chan had settled in the Pear Garden these days, enjoying the sun and looking at the books that had fallen over, very happy.

And the Pear Garden, as the residence of the former high priest's daughter, was very close to the high priest's palace. Xia Ge passed by the Pear Garden every time she went out and saw the girl in red squinting and smiling at her with her teeth and eyes.

...better not to mention it.

"How come the busy person remembers to find me?" Su Chan deliberately adjusted her rocking chair, turned her back to her, and spoke lazily, pretending not to want to see guests.

"I came to ask for your help," Xia Ge said expressionlessly.

"Oh my," Su Chan said, "that's rare."

Xia Ge was about to leave.

A red light flashed, and a hand grabbed Xia Ge's sleeve. The girl lazily said, "Hey, since you're here, why leave so soon and ruin the fun?"

Xia Ge was about to shake her off, but when she saw the sleeve, she froze, "...Xiangsi?"

Xiangsi tightly tied a knot around her wrist, and the exposed knot rubbed affectionately against her sleeve. Then, a flash of electricity surged through her body, causing Xiangsi to convulse all over.

But it still clung tightly to Xia Ge's sleeve.

Xia Ge: "..."
Xia Ge looked up at Su Chan, "You..."

Su Chan let go of her hand, and Xiangsi immediately coiled around Xia Ge's wrist, rubbing against it, feeling like a child who had been away from home for years and suddenly saw her mother.

"I am very sincere, right?" Su Chan turned the rocking chair around, propped up his chin and smiled at her, "Xiangsi is very cute, be careful not to let Zhen Hun bully her."

"What do you want?" Xia Ge said, not believing that this old fox could be so kind.

"It's boring to be like this." Su Chan lazily tilted his head and smiled seductively, "If I want to do something to you, can you resist?"

Xia Ge: "..."

You see, some people always make you want to slap them in the face.

Su Chan said, "I have been so bored here lately. Do you want to wander around with me?"

"I'm busy," Xia Ge said.

"What did you ask me to do? If I'm in a good mood, I might agree," Su Chan said.

Xia Ge: "..."

There is a solitary mountain in the Qian Hun Sect.

The peak of the mountain emits a warm and brilliant white light at night.

Xia Ge asked others what the white light was, and the people in the Qian Hun Sect shook their heads and said they didn't know. It seemed to be the work of the Sect Master.

The two of them went up the mountain, one after the other.

The mountain was bare and covered with some shrubs. It was a little chilly, but it was undeniably high.

When they reached halfway up the mountain, they could see the panoramic view of the Qian Hun Sect.

Su Chan exhaled a cold breath, "It's really big here."

He didn't care at all that he might be boasting.

Xia Ge didn't even glance at her. "It's quite big."
"Then stay here," Su Chan said. "I'll give you anything you want."

"Daydreams, although called daydreams, cannot come true just because you dream them during the day," Xia Ge said.

Su Chan smiled. "Xia Xia is really interesting."

Xia Ge fell silent.

Su Chan didn't say anything either. The two of them stayed together and quietly watched the enormous Qianhun Sect for a while.

After a while, Xia Ge heard her own voice. "...Why do it like that?"

Su Chan looked up at her, smiling but not really. "Do what?"

Xia Ge said, "...Normal puppets will turn into evil spirits after ten years."

"Madam Ye." Xia Ge looked at her, asking seriously, "Why make a puppet like Madam Ye?"

Su Chan said nonchalantly, "I wanted to, so I did. Why do you need a reason?"

Xia Ge didn't ask anything more.

Su Chan looked at her.

The young girl wore a black robe, black hair, black eyes, white skin like jade, and red lips and white teeth. The black belt and robe edges at her waist were rolled with white cloud patterns, and her entire aura appeared casual yet gentle.

She quietly gazed at the Qianhun Sect, as if pondering something, yet also as if not thinking about anything at all. The mountains withered and the clouds dispersed, but she was here.

- She was here.

Just thinking of these four words could make her heart race.

"In fact," Su Chan heard herself say, "it's not entirely without reason."

Xia Ge turned her head to look at her.

"Just sometimes, I feel regret about certain things," Su Chan gazed at the Qianhun Sect's movements. "I feel that some things shouldn't be easily given up."

"I was someone who was once abandoned by others." Su Chan's voice was light. "I know that kind of pain."

- Actually, it's not that kind of pain.
She just didn't want to recall the feeling of regret that was so painful it made her want to die.

Clearly, there was nothing wrong with what happened, so why regret it? Why feel so much pain?

Who hasn't experienced failure?

Who hasn't felt despair?

The world's heroes, like Xiang Yu, chose to commit suicide in the Wu River instead of making a comeback from the East Mountain, and thus handed over the country to Liu Bang.

If you don't follow a path to the end, you'll never know what it looks like.

And the only one who can decide whether it ends or not is oneself.

Su Chan's voice was calm as she looked into Xia Ge's eyes. "I want to prove something to someone... If she's still around, I want to show her that everything she believed in, her dreams, and the straightforward path she always believed in - one failure doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong."

"I want to take the road she abandoned."

"..." Xia Ge reacted for a moment. "Wait, are you talking about Lingxi Patriarch?"

As everyone knows, the Demon Sect has been established for over a hundred years, specializing in puppetry, going against the norm, and thus being targeted by people all over the world.

But the Demon Sect seemed to be protected by some mysterious force, and no matter how the righteous path attacked, it was like a wildfire that could not be extinguished, and it would grow again with the spring breeze.

Su Chan looked at her and then turned her eyes away, smiling. "If you want to think that way, you can."

After that person left.

Su Chan remembered what Gu Peijiu had said to her.

- To love someone is to love her world, her soul, and her dreams.

She didn't understand it before. She thought that as long as the person was by her side, it was enough.

But...

After experiencing so much, she suddenly understood this sentence.

Therefore, she hated Gu Peijiu even more.

- It seems like she always understands more than she does.
Therefore, she established the Thousand Soul Sect in the mortal world, teaching puppetry skills and walking the path that her lover did not want to take. 

She was the one abandoned by her lover. 

Therefore, she inherited everything that was abandoned by her lover. 

One day, when she returns, she will tell her, "What you fear is not the innocent wish, but the greedy human heart." 

She is her benefactor, unable to bless the earth, but at least she can fulfill her dream. 

Xia Ge didn't quite understand what Su Chan was talking about and asked, "Will Lady Ye really not have any more accidents?" 

Su Chan replied, "In theory, no." 

Xia Ge said, "Didn't the Lingxi Patriarch say the same thing back then?" 

Su Chan smiled and said, "Oh, maybe she will. If it happens, it happens. Anyway, I am already a heinous criminal, so it doesn't matter." 

Xia Ge remained speechless. 

The atmosphere relaxed a little. 

"Can I ask you a question?" Xia Ge said. "Why did you tear apart the formation symbol of the evil spirit mountain that day?" 

She was still angry about what Chu Yi had told her that day. 

"You had already pushed me to a dead end at that time, why bother?" Xia Ge questioned her. 

Su Chan blinked, "Because I am already a heinous criminal." 

Xia Ge remained speechless again. 

Seeing Xia Ge's speechless expression, Su Chan laughed again. Her red clothes fluttered, and her eyes shone. "Are you angry?" 

Xia Ge remained silent.
She said, "Actually, if you say, 'Achan, you're really cute,' I can tell you it's okay."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge got goosebumps all over her body. "You better not say that. I don't want to hear it."

Su Chan said, "Xia Xia is not cute anymore."

"Do you really not want to know?" Su Chan shook her head, looking like Xia Ge had missed out on a million-dollar prize. "That's too bad."

Xia Ge was curious again, but she really didn't want to say the words out loud.

She just turned her head and didn't say anything.

Su Chan said, "Okay, I'll make a deal with you. If you say 'Achan,' I'll tell you, okay?"

Seeing that Xia Ge still looked unwilling, Su Chan coaxed her, "Anyway, you've said it before."

Xia Ge sneered, "You didn't blame me for everything before."

Su Chan blinked. "Isn't this to tell you why I had to blame you?"

Xia Ge was speechless.

After a while, she reluctantly shouted, "Achan."

"Uh-huh."

The girl in the red dress responded, her eyes lit up with a smile like the warm sun of spring, so gentle that she seemed to be melting.

Xia Ge said uneasily, "...you should tell me why."

"Because I don't like to leave room for retreat." Su Chan blinked and said matter-of-factly, "At first, I found that the evil spirits were decreasing, so I went to find the source... and found out that the seal had indeed been repaired."

Xia Ge instantly wanted to slap herself a hundred times for shouting "Achan" just now.

She was depressed and thought, what can you expect from a dog's mouth? What a waste of time.

"But... it's not just that." Su Chan saw Xia Ge's depressed look and couldn't help but laugh. "Because, Evil Spirit Mountain will collapse one day."

Xia Ge looked at her. "What do you mean?"
Su Chan smiled and said, "Nothing lasts forever, everything has its own lifespan."

Xia Ge was going crazy, "Don't fool me! I said the Earth...no, I said the Wind and Moon Continent will sink one day! Can you say that sinking it yourself is the same as it sinking on its own?!"

Not only did you say you sank it, but you also said Xia Ge sank it!!

"Hmm, very smart." Su Chan patted her head, but Xia Ge immediately dodged and said with a frown, "Stay away from me."

Su Chan said sadly, "Can't I even touch you?"

Xia Ge said seriously, "No, I'm afraid the bad luck will spread."

Su Chan: "..."

"Don't tell me that's your reason?" Xia Ge looked at her, "If that's the reason, I won't accept it."

Su Chan looked at her, "You didn't accept it before either."

Xia Ge: "..."

Su Chan said, "Do you think I'll say something that will make you accept it? Or...what if you do accept it?"

The red-clothed girl leaned in, with a shallow smile and a seductive look in her eyes, "If you accept it...will you like me?"

Xia Ge stepped back, blushing and speechless.

"You see, you're taking advantage of me," Su Chan shrugged, "I never do a losing deal. If you didn't call me Ah Chan, I wouldn't have said it."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge felt like they couldn't continue this conversation.

She turned her head and tried to leave.

Su Chan seemed to be talking to herself, "Oh, actually, there's another reason..."

Xia Ge stopped and turned to look at her.

Su Chan smiled again, "See, you're taking advantage of me again."

Xia Ge: "..."
Xia Ge was going crazy, "I shouldn't have come out with you!!"

Seeing that Xia Ge was really getting angry with her, Su Chan lazily said, "Why are you getting angry? I did tell you."

Xia Ge held her forehead, turned her head and started walking down the mountain, "Don't say anything, I don't want to hear it."

"Because you're here," Su Chan suddenly said.

She repeated to herself, "I would do that, because you're here."

Xia Ge's footsteps paused.

"The Evil Spirit Mountain will collapse one day," Su Chan looked at the Qianhun Sect under the heavy clouds, "This is something that someone told me personally before she left."

"She said she didn't know how long the Evil Spirit Mountain could hold up... she told me that if the Evil Spirit Mountain collapses, I should handle it properly."

"She hoped that I could take good care of it."

And then she left me.

Xia Ge turned to look at her, but could only see her back.

The girl in red stood on a protruding flat ground on the mountain, the wind on the mountain was cold, blowing her crimson dress.

Loneliness in the world.

"I promised her," Su Chan's voice was faint, "But I don't even know where the Evil Spirit Mountain is."

"I don't even know what I should do if the Evil Spirit Mountain collapses."

I loved her so much.

Loved her so much that I couldn't bear to forget her, loved her so much that I tossed and turned at night, loved her so much that every time I slept with hope and woke up with wishes.

Loved her so much that I almost hated her.

"So, instead of being clueless like this," Su Chan said, "Instead of guarding a hopeless hope like this."

- She became like Lady Ye.
She achieved her dream, but that person was no longer there.

Everything she had worked for over the past century seemed to have no meaning.

"I hate that she didn't come back, I hate that my existence is meaningless," Su Chan said calmly. "So, I destroyed Evil Spirit Mountain."

"Later...you repaired the barrier of Evil Spirit Mountain," Su Chan turned to look at her.

-And I knew, you had come back.

Finally, you couldn't rest assured and came back.

"So, I completely destroyed it."

Su Chan said, "No one knows when it will collapse again."

No one knows how long you will stay here.

"Instead of waiting to die, it's better to take the initiative."

Xia Ge looked at her confused, not understanding her thoughts. "What you did was meaningless. Even if I can repair the barrier of Evil Spirit Mountain again, the evil spirits have long since disappeared-"

"No, it's meaningful." Su Chan looked at her and said, "It's meaningful to me."

Once Evil Spirit Mountain collapses, you will never let go.

To her, all living beings were just ants.

The fortune god who had lost all compassion was, in the end, just a mortal yearning for you to look back.
