When Xia Ge woke up, what she saw was the magnificent ceiling of the priest's temple.

The system said, "You're awake?"

The quilt on her body was soft and lightweight.

When she came to her senses, she sat up and exclaimed in despair, "How the f*ck did I come back again?!"

The system replied, "Stop pretending to be innocent. You originally didn't want to leave."

As Xia Ge rubbed her temples and got out of bed, she realized something was wrong.

How did she come back?

She couldn't remember anything.

As her toes touched the cold floor, a broken memory flashed through her mind.

A girl's voice, sad yet resolute.

"You will regret this!"

Then, everything turned blood red.

"Ah...it hurts!"

At the moment she remembered the voice, her brain felt like it was being pricked by needles, causing her to roll around in pain. She tightly covered her head with her hands and moaned.

She was still wearing the pitch-black Zhen Hun robe. When no one was looking, the white flame-like pattern on the hem of the robe burned in the darkness like poison, spreading upwards.

"[Host's spirit is under attack! Protect it! Protect...]"
 
Suddenly, the door was slammed open and Su Chan rushed in without a word. She held Xia Ge's painful and curled up body and gently stroked her forehead. Warm, white blessings flowed into Xia Ge's body, and her pale face slowly regained some color.

Xia Ge was sweating profusely from the pain.

She weakly asked, "What happened to me?"
Did she just remember something? No, wait, she didn't lose her memory. What is she thinking about?

No, that's not it...

How did she come back?! Why does she have no memory of it?

Su Chan: "It's nothing, don't think too much about it."

After speaking, she stood up and tried to leave, but Xia Ge grabbed her sleeve.

"What do you know?!" She stared at Su Chan, "You... tell me!"

The girl in red turned around and looked at the hand pulling her sleeve for a while.

The knuckles were white and she was using a lot of force.

As if trying to hold her back.

Even though she knew it wasn't true, Su Chan still smiled, with a hint of spring in the corners of her eyes and mouth, "...you don't want to let me go?"

Xia Ge immediately let go of her hand.

Su Chan smiled indifferently, turned around and was about to leave.

But then her clothes were grabbed again by Xia Ge, her face turning red with anger, "...you come back here!"

Su Chan said, "When you don't need me, you turn around and leave. When you need me, you hold me back like this."

She looked at Xia Ge, as if sighing, "I owe so many people money and lives in my life, but it's only in front of you that I can be so cheap."

Xia Ge laughed angrily.

What the hell, the one who owes money is the boss now?!

And the point is, what is this all about?!

Xia Ge calmed down and stared at her, "How did I fall for this?"

Su Chan remained calm, "I knocked you out and took you away."

Xia Ge laughed angrily again, "Do you think I'm stupid?! I was walking with the group and then you just knocked me out and took me away?! How the hell are you so amazing?!"
Su Chan furrowed her beautiful eyebrows and educated her, "Girls shouldn't use foul language."

Xia Ge lied and sneered, "I've already said all the foul language I know to you in this lifetime."

The system: "..."

Su Chan smiled and said, "Then say a few more for me to hear."

Xia Ge went crazy, "Who the f*** has time to recite foul language for you to hear?! Why do you want to listen... no, I want you to tell me what happened!! Last time... last time you brought me back from Lingxi Peak like this too! Are you poisonous, Su Chan?! Fine, I won't investigate how I came back! I don't want to trouble you, Senior Sister, and I don't want to ask for your help! I don't want to stay here anymore! I have something I need to do now!!"

Not investigating was good.

If she were to pursue it relentlessly, she didn't know how to fabricate it.

"What do you need to do?" Su Chan smiled slightly. "What can you do now?"

Xia Ge said, "It's none of your business."

Su Chan said, "Even if you don't say it, I know."

"It's nothing more than... going to the Evil Spirit Mountain, resealing it, killing the evil spirits, and telling Ye Ze the truth about the Chang family..." Su Chan's voice was slow and deliberate. "Anyway, Xia Xia must be thinking this way in her heart..."

"'Anyway, I don't trust this person, I can't save Senior Sister, but I can't sit here waiting to die. I have to go out and do something...'" Xia Ge's pupils slightly contracted. "You know about the Chang family—"

"Shh—" Su Chan narrowed her eyes, and a finger pressed against Xia Ge's soft lips. The sleeve stained with blood slid silently to the elbow, and a beautiful wrist was wrapped in a circle of snow-white ribbon, with a bow tied at the end, finally drifting down.

Xia Ge naturally didn't know that it was the wound she had bitten off.

Su Chan leaned in close to her, and her breath was audible.

"It seems like you're finding something to do for yourself."

Xia Ge's breath slightly tightened.

"But you're just avoiding the fact that you're powerless."

Her fingers slid over her lips, her smooth skin slowly moving down, then lifting her chin, her eyes faintly intoxicated, mixed with pity, "You're so pitiful, Xia Xia."

"But I still..."

Still couldn't help but like her - covered in blood, nowhere to go, a bit pitiful, but still innocent and naive.

Pitiful?!

Who the hell is pitiful?!

Without a doubt, Xia Ge, who was poked at his sore spot, almost used all his strength and slapped her face hard - 

"You're the pitiful one, your whole family is pitiful! Get the hell out of here!"

= =

Su Chan's beautiful face was marked with a slap as she lazily left the temple.

Qin Yue was at the door.

Su Chan glanced at her, then muttered to herself as if nothing had happened, "Ah, I was kicked out."

Qin Yue: "..."

If you look for trouble, you can't blame others.

Su Chan touched the slap mark on her face and comforted herself, "It doesn't hurt much, Xia Xia still showed mercy."

Qin Yue: "...it's already turning purple."

Su Chan smiled enchantingly, "That's because I'm too delicate."

Qin Yue: "..."

As they spoke, the two had already walked far from the temple, passing by the pear garden.

Qin Yue finally dared to speak, "Why do you have to provoke her?"

Su Chan's footsteps stopped.

Tiny pear blossoms fell from the sky.
"Because..." 

She couldn't answer her own question. 

She couldn't answer how she had come back to where she was. 

As if at that moment, the bloodied red-eyed girl looked back from the depths of time, becoming her inner demon. 

"Although gods like to lie," she reached out and took a piece of pear blossom, murmuring, "but occasionally..." 

Thinking of Xia Ge's angry black eyes, Su Chan didn't continue speaking, just silently thinking to herself. 

Originally, she too occasionally had moments where she couldn't continue lying. 

Qin Yue said, "Leader... your face..." 

"Not good-looking?" Su Chan glanced at her. 

The red-clothed girl was still graceful and charming, even with a slightly purple bruise on her fair face, as if wearing a mask in the shape of a slap. 

Qin Yue reluctantly said, "...it's very nice." 

Su Chan said softly, "Do you think if I go to her with this face every day, she'll feel sorry for me?" 

Qin Yue: "..."

No, I guess she might give your delicate face another slap. 

But she still said reluctantly, "...maybe." 

Su Chan glanced at her again, "I know what you're thinking." 

= = 

The Priest's Temple. 

Su Chan had been kicked out by Xia Ge, but Xia Ge wasn't feeling happy about it. 

She asked coldly, "Do you think she deserves a beating?"
System: "Um... a little bit."

But you hit her too hard with that slap...

However, the person involved doesn't seem to care much.

After calming herself down for a while, Xia Ge suddenly remembered that she had asked Su Chan how she had come back.

"What the hell? She used some kind of trickery to get past me!"

Xia Ge gritted her teeth in frustration.

The system recalled, "But you said you wouldn't pursue it."

"Can I really not pursue it?!" Xia Ge was at a loss, "I was so angry with her! Couldn't you have reminded me to calm down?"

The system replied, "..." You said you were angry, how could you calm down?

"...Okay," Xia Ge rubbed her temples helplessly, "It seems like I won't be able to get any answers from her. Do you know anything?"

"I don't know," the system replied, "If you were unconscious, I would have put you in forced sleep mode."

"Have I never been asleep while you were awake?" Xia Ge was dissatisfied, "Why are you so useless?"

"I share your five senses and perceptions on a soul level. If you're asleep, how can I be awake? If I'm awake, wouldn't that make me your second personality? I'm a principled system and never do anything without morals, like possessing someone..."

"Okay, stop it. I'm asking if you have any equipment that can monitor others while I'm asleep."

"What do you want to do?" the system asked.

Xia Ge stood up and rubbed her temples, "I just have a feeling that something is not right."

The girl's words echoed in her mind like thunder.

In the blank space of her memory, there seemed to be a faint trace.

Xia Ge tried hard to remember.

The girl's voice was sad and resolute.
"Brother's loved one will never wake up!" Xia Ge's face suddenly turned pale. This seems to be...

The system tentatively said, "Did you remember something?"

The sound of the system interrupted Xia Ge's memory, and the familiar feeling that had surfaced suddenly sank again.

Xia Ge sensitively asked, "What did I remember?"

The system replied, "It's nothing, it's nothing... Oh, you said you wanted to monitor the equipment outside, I'll go find it for you."

Xia Ge didn't say anything.

She was trying to piece together what she could remember.

She was convinced by Chu Yi and then used some secret method with the people from the Hundred Ghosts Cave to cross the Ten Thousand Puppet Array outside the Thousand Souls Sect. Then, they used a teleportation array to leave the Thousand Souls Sect's territory, and then...

She lost consciousness.

No, there was... a little bit of an impression.

The people from the Hundred Ghosts Cave were all wearing black robes and masks, they were very mysterious, but her last impression was...

A pale mask was shattered, revealing a face of fear stained with gruesome blood.

Xia Ge's pupils and heart tightened slightly, as if stimulated by something, and the blurry memory suddenly became clear!

With her memory at the level of the Earth Realm, once she remembered something, she could see it clearly.

And after it became clear...

Xia Ge's face became a little pale.

In that person's pupils.

It seemed to be her face?

...Why?!
