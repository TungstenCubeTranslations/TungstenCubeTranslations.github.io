The eastern sky turned a fish-belly white.

The two continued to walk eastward, and it should have been a peaceful journey, but it wasn't.

Desires in their hearts churned like a black hole. Dou Dou couldn't hold on any longer, and after not walking far, black mist burst from behind Dou Dou like a punctured balloon.

Xia Ge was surprised, "What's going on?!"

Dou Dou remained silent, his soul pitch-black, with only a pair of eyes staring at her, deep and obsessive.

The system said, "It's because of the previous demonization! Hurry up and make a puppet! There's still a chance to save her! Otherwise, she won't make it!"

Xia Ge was caught off guard by this sudden accident and quickly woke Dou Dou up. She hurriedly made a crude puppet with the materials in her ring and used "Resurrection" to revive Dou Dou.

Xia Ge was able to manipulate the puppet, but her puppet-making skills were not great.

The system checked the quality of the puppet and honestly said, "I think this puppet can last for a week at most..."

Xia Ge stayed by the puppet's side, feeling a bit melancholy. "I also..." she thought.

It was her first time making a humanoid puppet, and her skills were limited.

But no matter what, she managed to barely pull the person back from the brink of demonization.

Even though it wouldn't last long.

Dou Dou woke up soon after and saw Xia Ge. She looked a bit bewildered and said, "Sister?"

Xia Ge replied, "Yeah."

Dou Dou went to touch her face. The puppet's hand was very cold, but she didn't seem to mind. She just stared at Xia Ge, looking a bit confused. "Sister seems to have gotten smaller?" she said.

It was a fault of the River of Time.

Xia Ge lied, "Ah, that, when you were unconscious, I took some medicine that made me look smaller. If you're not like this now, I can give you some."

Rejuvenation, what an exciting thing. If she were eighty years old, she might have been happy about it, but she had just turned sixteen, so returning to her younger self wasn't exactly a joyous occasion.

Dou Dou said, "Oh," as if she didn't care and began to test out her new body. After getting used to it, she found it a bit interesting. She knocked her hand against the tree, making a creaking sound.

Dou Dou's eyes shone as she looked at her elbow and found it amusing. "Creak, creak," she said.
Xia Ge felt guilty: "Wait for me, let me apply some oil for you..."

The system: "......"

"I'm alive now, sister." Dou Dou smiled and didn't say what was on her mind.

--I can finally touch you.

Even as a puppet, Xia Ge could clearly see the heartfelt joy in her glass-like eyes.

Xia Ge knew that time was running out for her.

Before this puppet was decommissioned, she had to find Dou Dou's home. Otherwise, the puppet would break before the soul was demonized, causing great harm to Dou Dou's soul.

"Are you sure we should keep going east?" Xia Ge asked Dou Dou.

Dou Dou nodded obediently, "Yes, keep going east."

Then she reached out to Xia Ge.

Xia Ge: "???"

After a while, she realized that Dou Dou might be asking for her parents' ashes. Because she was a soul before, Dou Dou couldn't hold it, so Xia Ge had been keeping it for her.

Xia Ge took the ashes out of her ring and gave them to her. Dou Dou was stunned for a moment, then hugged them to her chest.

Although Xia Ge's puppet-making skills were not great in terms of details, the face was made according to Dou Dou's face, with eyebrows and eyes painted, and then the bones were carved bit by bit, covered with spiritual mud, and the best eye material from her ring was used.

It was beautiful and delicate.

The two continued to head east together.

Dou Dou followed behind, looking at Xia Ge's back, her gaze slowly lowering and focusing on her fingertips.

Her hands were very white and tender.

She wanted to...touch them.

Dou Dou bit her lip. Actually, she didn't want the ashes just now...she wanted to touch Xia Ge.

It should be okay, just holding hands.
She held the urn of ashes in one hand, while nervously reaching out with the other to gently grasp Xia Ge's fingertips.

The cold metal bones of Xia Ge's fingers were hard, even though they were covered in soft white clay, as befitting a puppet.

Xia Ge suddenly smiled and grasped the girl's hand in return.

In an instant, Dou Dou felt a slight tremble, as a warm feeling spread from her fingertips to every inch of her body, directly overwhelming her soul.

Leaving her confused and enchanted.

It was March, and the grass was long and the birds were singing.

Xia Ge and Dou Dou traveled eastward and finally arrived at a place where peach blossoms were in full bloom, Peach Blossom Village.

Before this, it was an undeniable fact that Xia Ge was getting smaller and smaller. Xia Ge had originally thought that if Dou Dou asked, she would say that it might be a side effect of taking too much medicine before - but for some reason, Dou Dou didn't ask a single word.

As if she knew nothing at all.

Dou Dou occasionally asked her some trivial questions, such as what she liked to eat, what she used to do, and what her favorite color was.

It seemed insignificant, but it was like taking one step after another.

"What's the name of the river that sister is looking for?" Dou Dou asked.

"The River of Time."

"The River of Time..." she murmured thoughtfully.

Peach Blossom Village had flowing water under small bridges, with pink flowers blooming everywhere, and the fragrance of peach blossoms was faintly discernible.

Xia Ge murmured, "Is this Peach Blossom Village?"

Was this the hometown of Dou Dou's parents?

"Yes, this is it," Dou Dou said. "Thank you for bringing me here."

This journey was neither long nor short, full of wonders, but all good things must come to an end.

After Dou Dou went through reincarnation, Xia Ge would go find the River of Time.

Xia Ge found a giant peach tree, buried the two urns of ashes properly, and then bowed respectfully.


Doudou also paid respects to the ashes.

For some reason, Xiage felt familiar with this scene. She didn't think for long before remembering that her senior sister had also taken her to see peach blossoms... when she was growing her bones.

Now, going against the growth, her bones no longer hurt, and the peach blossoms here were especially beautiful, not inferior to those over there.

What was that place called again?

Cloud City.

Yes, Cloud City.

But she always felt like something was missing.

"Have you fulfilled your obsession?" Xiage asked her.

Doudou stared at her and softly replied, "Yes, it's fulfilled."

Xiage touched her head and was silent for a long time before asking, "Then... can you go through reincarnation now?"

This puppet's body couldn't hold on for much longer, and Xiage only hoped that she could resolve her obsession and return to reincarnation.

"Sister, keep going east." Doudou didn't answer her question, but suddenly said, "Keep going, keep going east."

Xiage was slightly startled.

"This way... I can leave." Doudou took Xiage's hand with her stiff, cold hand and lightly kissed it. "I'm going through reincarnation."

She had already made a wish to the ashes. The River of Time that Xiage was looking for would appear in the east.

- You're going back to find the person you like.

The puppet's skeleton suddenly fell apart with a crisp sound, as if it had lost its soul and shattered into pieces in an instant.

Like nothing was left.

Xiage hadn't even reacted yet when she heard the sound of rushing river water coming from the east. At the same time, dazzling golden light flickered in the sky, and a cold stone tablet fell from the sky and landed in the distant east!

System: "Hurry! It's the River of Time!"
"Why did the Time River suddenly appear?!" 

Xia Ge felt uneasy, but couldn't find anything wrong. She instinctively took a few steps towards the direction of the river, but felt like something was missing or not quite right. She turned back and looked at the broken puppets on the ground, thinking of Dou Dou, feeling inexplicably sad. 

"What are you staring at?! Hurry up and go!" the system said. 

Xia Ge turned around, wanting to pick up the puppet fragments on the ground, but as soon as her hand touched them, the fragments turned into dust and disappeared completely. 

In the wind, Dou Dou's gentle voice seemed to come through. 

"Goodbye." 

= = 

She left. 

The breeze blew, peach blossoms falling all around, and the sound of the Milky Way rushing downstream. 

Black mist filled the air, and Dou Dou looked up, feeling like everything was becoming blurry. 

Reincarnation... was a lie. 

Peach Blossom Village was not where the gods lost their souls, and even if it was... 

She couldn't go to reincarnation. 

Because her obsession was no longer to go home. 

The black smoke dispersed, and Dou Dou thought. 

Her obsession had, at some point, turned into... wanting to be with Xia Jiejie forever and ever. 

Actually, in the moment she became a ghost, everything about the gods seemed to become blurry. Only one voice stubbornly told her to bring the ashes of the father god and mother goddess back to their hometown. 

Return to that place, where she couldn't even remember the name, but was filled with peach blossoms. 

But in the end, she couldn't find that place. 

The gods' obsession was shallow, but the obsession that made her demonic was heavy. 

Because of her.
At some point, suddenly, Dou Dou felt that Xia Ge was also very important.

"When was that?" 

Her memories were fragmented, Dou Dou hesitated for a moment, and then remembered.

It was when those peach blossom demons said that Xia Jie Jie had died.

At that moment, she felt a sudden pain and sadness, as if she had lost something very important.

It was even more heartbreaking than being lost and unable to find her way home.

Dou Dou looked at her increasingly black soul, feeling a little absent-minded, and that's how it became like this.

The black energy slowly penetrated every inch of Dou Dou's body, and she gazed at the blue sky, as if everything was blurred.

But she vaguely remembered something.

She remembered that the old peach blossom demon said that Xia Jie Jie came from five hundred years later, the wrong time and the wrong person.

He also said that time was punishing her, and Xia Jie Jie would gradually become smaller. In a maximum of three months, time would take away everything given to her, turn her into a baby, and then she would die.

Did Jie Jie know?

She probably did.

Dou Dou thought.

But... even though she knew time would flow backwards, why didn't she hurry up and find the River of Time, and still said she wanted to help her? She even said she would send her back?

Dou Dou didn't understand, but she felt very gentle.

She liked her even more and wanted to kiss her, to love her.

The unfamiliar desire turned her obsession into a hope - to be with her.

So, even if they couldn't find the God of Death, even if they found the true location of the God of Death, she couldn't go through reincarnation.

And they couldn't be together.

Besides, Xia Jie Jie had someone she liked waiting for her in the past.
Although she always says she's unsure, doesn't know if she should or shouldn't, but Dou Dou can tell.

She must really like that person because whenever she mentions them, the corners of her eyes and mouth soften involuntarily.

Is that person also named Dou Dou?

Dou Dou doesn't know.

But if she likes them, she's willing to bear that name just because she likes them.

She once heard someone say that if you love someone, you would want them to always be smiling, always happy, carefree is the best, if... if they're happy because of you, that's even better.

She doesn't remember who said it... maybe it was the mother goddess, maybe it was the father god.

Even if she's not happy because of herself, as long as she's happy, she'll feel happy too.

At first, Dou Dou didn't quite understand, but now she does.

She loves her, even if she's her demonized obsession, even if it hurts to be demonized, even if her instincts tell her to use any means necessary to keep her, even if it means risking her life.

But she can't do it.

She wants her to be happy, whether it's because of her or not, whether she loves her or not.

Dou Dou understands.

Seeing the person you love makes you happy.

She's glad to have met her, she's been happy for so long, so she also hopes that Xia Jiejie can meet the person she loves soon.

So she can be happy sooner.

That's why she lied to her and said Peach Blossom Village is her hometown, and why she made a wish with her ashes to make the River of Time appear.

The black mist slowly covered everything.

So in the end... she still, still can't bear to let her go.

Xia Ge...

Xia, Ge.
Summer Song.

Love at first sight.

"I... can I wait for you?" Dou Dou muttered to himself, "I can wait for a long, long time..."

The enchantment has already begun.

From then on, everything became blurry. She would forget everything, only remembering her obsession, and an unfulfillable obsession would only make her become a fierce and evil spirit, with no future.

Perhaps, she can't even wait anymore.

The peach blossoms in Peach Blossom Village are indeed beautiful. Xia Wushuang accompanied Chu Shi to admire them for a while, but felt that something was not right with the wind.

"Hey, where are you going?" Chu Shi asked.

"I'm going to take a look over there." Xia Wushuang casually picked a peach blossom and inserted it on Chu Shi's head. "Hey, you look so pretty, wait for me here."

Chu Shi took the peach blossom off her head. "What a weird thing, it's so ugly."

But she didn't throw it away.

"Go and come back soon!"

"Okay."
