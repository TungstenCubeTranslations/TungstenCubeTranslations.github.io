She definitely had to go and observe the auction.

However, after taking a few steps towards the Black Rock Cave, she stopped.

"What's wrong?" the system asked in confusion.

Xia Ge paused for a moment. "...It's just a feeling."

Since she first started selling things, she had a vague feeling...

As if someone had been watching her all along.

"What kind of feeling?" The system was still unclear. Xia Ge shook her head. "It's nothing, let's go."

After speaking, she entered the Black Rock Cave where she paid her rent. It was pitch black inside. After taking three steps, the frog-faced puppet was still there guarding the entrance. Although its eyes were staring at her, its body still shrank back quietly when it saw her coming in.

...The Ghost Dragon Jade was really useful.

Seeing its cowardly appearance, Xia Ge's mood suddenly improved.

The Black Rock Cave was very dark. There were stone steps leading down, which had been widened by people. On top of them was a dark red blanket made of what seemed to be wild animal fur. The stone walls were covered with countless overlapping and complex formations carved in mithril, which automatically shone with a silver light in the darkness, illuminating the entire cave below. Xia Ge thought of the "rules" that the Curse Wealth Infant Puppet had mentioned before, one of which was "do not step on the formation." Could this "formation" be the secret formations drawn on the walls?

But how could they be stepped on if they were on the wall?

After thinking about it casually, Xia Ge didn't delve into it any further. She picked up her pace and walked down the stairs. There were also many cloak-wearing people passing by her, some of whom she didn't know if they were human or ghost. The stairs were winding and twisted, and there was a chilling ghostly atmosphere. Xia Ge walked very carefully.

However, she stopped shortly after walking for a while.

The stairs continued downwards, but there were three or four forked paths in front of her, one of which was the main road that continued downwards, while the other two or three were paths that she didn't know where they led. The secret silver formations on the damp stone walls were shining with mysterious silver light, and Xia Ge stopped her footsteps.

How should she go?

There were people coming and going on all these paths, with their masks being weird and grotesque. Some were pure black paper with two holes dug out, some were beautiful butterflies, and some were foxes. The further she went inside, the more strange and bizarre the masks she encountered were, but at the same time, their breaths were also becoming more and more concealed.

In this broken place of the black market, it was not like on the street where you could shout "Excuse me, can you tell me where to go?" and people would tell you. Perhaps if you shouted on this side and bumped into someone, you wouldn't even know how you died the next day.

Although she was not well-versed in puppetry, Xia Ge also knew that some people couldn't be shouted at casually. Because she knew about a passive puppet curse, where the puppet master would place this curse on themselves. No matter who made a sound, as long as he responded, the person who made the sound would be unlucky.

For example, if you shouted "beauty" on the street, and the puppet master who had placed this curse responded, then congratulations, his puppet would be able to trace you and climb up to your bathroom to watch you take a shower the next day.

Moreover, besides this, who knew if there was poison on their cloak or if they had some terrible verbal curse.
She didn't dare to ask for directions, but she couldn't stop here either. She picked up the promotional flyer from the little dwarf with the paper mask. She had heard that the market was here and acted impulsively. But since it was a black market flyer, the address should be on it.

She looked at the flyer, expecting to find the address of the black market, but instead the ink slowly faded away, leaving only an arrow pointing straight ahead.

"Wow," Xia Ge muttered to herself.

The arrow on the paper was magical. It would move like a compass and point in the right direction whenever she turned. She followed the arrow and walked down the winding path of the underground passage, passing many halls and small caves where people were carving runes on the walls. Since it was still early and the black market only opened at night, Xia Ge couldn't resist studying the runes for a while.

Suddenly, she felt someone was watching her.

She didn't panic, but kept her composure and pretended to finish studying the runes before continuing on her way. She looked at the people around her, all dressed in black cloaks or other strange and bulky clothes, with weird masks covering their faces. It was hard to tell who was who.

Was it just her imagination that someone was following her? Xia Ge wondered. She looked at the paper in her hand and then at the two forks in the road ahead. She made up her mind and deliberately took the wrong path. As expected, the road became less crowded and she walked for a long time until she reached a dead end with a closed bronze door. When she turned around, there was no one behind her and the feeling of being watched disappeared.

Was it just her imagination after all?

Xia Ge was puzzled. She had only sold a pair of pills, how could she have attracted someone's attention? She had only received a hundred medium-grade spirit stones, which shouldn't be a lot of money in such a big market like the black market.

As she looked around, she saw that the road was wide and the bronze door was surrounded by two huge colorful stone sculptures, each about three or four meters tall. One of them held a long knife in one hand and a pen in the other, wearing a Confucian robe and a fierce expression. The other one held a red war spear, wearing armor and a ferocious look, like the door gods she had seen before in the modern world.

Xia Ge felt a bit uneasy looking at these two "door gods" in such a place full of unknown people and ghosts. But just as she was pondering, she heard voices coming from behind the bronze door.

The quiet stone passage suddenly became filled with the sound of footsteps and low voices. Xia Ge was startled and quickly kicked off her high heels and put them in her flowing silver ring. She then ran barefoot like a ghost, climbing up to the head of the stone sculpture holding the war spear, hugging its neck tightly.
The statue was three to four meters tall and thin, so she had enough room to hide behind its neck. Xia Ge held her breath nervously.

The closed copper door creaked open.

"I'll figure something out, just leave me alone."

As the door opened, the conversation became clear. The two people stopped at the door, seemingly intending to finish their conversation.

Xia Ge's hand holding the statue's neck stiffened, and she didn't dare to move.

But that voice...?

"We need to speed things up," another voice said lightly. "The leader is getting impatient."

"I know, I know, I'm impatient too."

The leader? Wait, who could be called a leader in Fengyue Continent...?

Xia Ge's body suddenly felt a little chilly.

"Even if you're impatient, you have to endure it. If you're efficient, it will end quickly."

"The high priest is stupid, her intelligence, tsk tsk, she deserves it."

"She's been imprisoned for so long, she should have learned her lesson." The other voice paused for a moment before continuing, "I just hope she's a little more sensible and doesn't do anything stupid again."

"..."

High priest? What high priest? Imprisoned?

Xia Ge's brain spun rapidly, trying to recall the plot. Was this part of it?

"Anyway, you need to get the key quickly and bring her out. The leader needs her. This time, when the 'Zhen Hun' is born, it should temporarily attract the attention of those idiots. Keep an eye on who buys it and find a way to kill them to eliminate future troubles."

The idiots who are attracted, Xia Ge: "..."

He sneered, "All we need to do is release the news that 'Zhen Hun' has been born and stir up the water."

The other voice lazily replied, "Hmm, I know."

This voice... really... the more Xia Ge listened, the more familiar it sounded.
Xia Ge slowly felt a bad premonition rising in her heart. She thought of the brother she had seen outside the Heiyan Cave with a hole in his cloak, and the snow-white jade pendant. She couldn't believe that just by taking a wrong turn, she had ended up here.

"So...the soul-restraining item in this auction is fake?"

"There are two keys to the Jianfeng Mountain Prison, one of which is in the hands of Chang Lan, which is difficult to obtain. But your brother sent a message a few days ago, saying that the second key is in the hands of a backup disciple of Jianfeng."

"A backup disciple...Chu Yao?!"

There really were spies!

Xia Ge carefully looked down from behind the statue's head and vaguely saw two shadows in black cloaks. The person speaking had their back to the statue and spoke in a cold tone, "Bairan, find a way to get the key and rescue the person. Your mission will be over then."

...Bairan?! Mission?!

So her brother...her brother was Bailuo?! It sounded like he was lurking in Jianfeng as a spy.

And there was more than one!

The person facing the statue wore a pure black smiling mask. The white smile on the black mask and the two empty eye sockets gave off an eerie and sinister light under the faint light of the secret silver formation on the stone wall. He casually raised his head and looked towards the statue, his voice indifferent, "Got it, got it."

He raised his head?!

Xia Ge, barefoot, stepped on a small protrusion on the back of the statue. But because the other person raised their head, she felt her heart tighten, her foot slipping, and she grabbed the statue's neck, hanging on it suddenly!

"Who?!"

Oh no!

The next second, countless paper blades flew towards the statue where Xia Ge was. Xia Ge quickly shrank her hand holding the statue and hid behind it. The sharp paper blades with endless energy pierced through the red gatekeeper holding a long spear, making him look like a sieve. Many of them grazed Xia Ge's hair and fiercely embedded themselves in the stone wall behind the gatekeeper, leaving three inches deep!

Xia Ge thought to herself, "He really is a great god! He blocked the disaster! I will definitely burn incense for you when I go back!"

Although she prayed to the gods and buddhas in her heart, her actions were not sloppy. Xia Ge immediately activated her Ghost Shadow Step and entered the bronze door that the two men had opened earlier. The two men were not stupid either. Bairan controlled the paper like a flying sword, and countless slender paper blades flew towards Xia Ge. Some of them barely missed her cloak, but Xia Ge acted quickly. Almost at the same time that she entered the bronze door, she kicked it shut, blocking the paper blades that were raining down like a storm behind the door!

However, some of the paper blades still flew in, but Xia Ge was quick to dodge and wasn't injured.

"You're too naive!"

The two men kicked open the bronze door, but behind it was a pile of shredded paper that the other person had thrown in before they could close the door. The hall was clean and there was no way out. However, the person had disappeared.
Blade sneered, "He can't run far."

Another person also had a grim expression, "Are you sure you saw him clearly?"

"I saw him clearly, he was wearing a bronze mask with a missing corner and was about five or six feet tall," Blade said, "Let the black market search for him!"

"Who knows how many people heard what you just said, be careful," the other person warned.

"Tsk."

The two of them looked around unwillingly, but in the end, they found nothing. The other person said in a sinister tone, "It's a pity there's nothing left, otherwise I could have cast a curse."

Blade sneered, "Do whatever you want, but don't show off your disgusting magic to me, I don't like it."

"Hmph, do you think I want to show off to you? The auction is about to start, you go ahead, I'll stay here and keep looking," the other person said.

After discussing it, Blade agreed and turned around to leave. No one noticed that a small piece of paper was mixed in with the scattered paper on the ground and stuck to Blade's foot.

The other person remained oblivious and just looked at the mess of paper in the hall, muttering, "All they can do is leave a paper trail, they don't even notice when their cloak is torn. They're so full of themselves."
