"How come she left again?" 

"Someone told her about the bad things I did," Su Chan said leisurely. "So she left."

"But didn't you say she found a reason to convince herself?" Qin Yue said. "Thank goodness you have some self-awareness."

"A reason? Not really," Su Chan said. 

"Just give her a goal," she continued. "Just give her a little bit...and it will become the last straw that breaks the camel's back."

Qin Yue was speechless. 

In the end, it was because you did something too excessive.

"Well, it's good that she left," Su Chan said, looking at the sky carelessly. "She left, and the sea is wide enough for fish to leap, and the sky is high--"

Her voice suddenly stopped. 

In a distant time, a young girl held her hand and led her to the edge of a cliff, looking up at the vast sky. 

"Someday, you won't be troubled by your inner demons," the girl's voice was cheerful. "By then, the sea will be wide enough for fish to leap, the sky will be high, and the birds will fly freely!"

The hot tea was boiling. 

"Leader!" Qin Yue exclaimed in surprise. 

Su Chan looked at the tea-stained tablecloth and put the teacup aside. Her eyebrows finally took on a hint of gloom. 

...Her Xia Wushuang, her Xia Xia, the demon in her heart that slept forever above the common people. 

"I can't save her," Su Chan said. 

"But I will always be by her side." 

She stood up. 

"She passed through the Ten Thousand Puppets Formation?" 

Qin Yue's voice was complicated. 

"It was someone from the Hundred Ghosts Cave who took the Little Priestess away. She left a long time ago," Qin Yue said. 

"...I shouldn't have stopped her if she wanted to leave," Su Chan said, laughing at herself.
Qin Yue remained silent.

"But I'm afraid she'll regret it again," Su Chan held his forehead and murmured, "Her last regret almost drove me crazy."

The next moment, Su Chan disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yue looked at the still shaking chair. Although she didn't understand the leader's words, she was even more worried.

==

The road to the Demon Sect was not very far.

But for Chu Yao, this not-so-far road suddenly became very long.

Chang'an, teahouse.

A peach blossom was planted outside the teahouse. The climate in Chang'an was pleasant, and the peach blossom was very beautiful.

However, compared with the beauty of the peach blossom, the news of her father's death seemed somewhat desolate.

The girl sat in the window seat, dressed in black, carrying a simple small package. Upon hearing this news, the tea in her hand was a little unstable.

"The old master of the Chu family passed away suddenly..."

"...That's secondary. Have you heard about the will he left behind? He actually wants to..."

Chu Zhan passed away, leaving a will. The second daughter, Chu Yi, inherited the position of family head, and the eldest daughter was engaged to the Chang family.

Father's last glance did not see Chu Yao.

In theory, she should have returned to the Chu family immediately to keep watch over her father's body.

Chu Yao put down her tea and stood up.

The sound of the Chu family's mourning ceremony was shallow, "Do you regret it?"

Chu Yao did not reach an agreement with the Chu family's mourning ceremony. She really didn't want to wear a tattered dress that kept mentioning how great the Chu family was. The result of the negotiation was to pack it up.

The details were that Chu Yao had a slightly conspicuous small package on her back.

Chu Yao smiled and left the teahouse, with a faint and casual look in her eyes.
"I, as a member of the Chu family, have made a decision and will stick to it till the end."

"Perhaps I might regret it, but I will never turn back."

Chu Dao Ji Ling remained silent at Chu Shi's words. "You are just like her."

Chu Shi was the same, once she made the decision to conquer the world, she never looked back.

Some people may say that she regretted it to the point of suicide, but as she walked the path she chose, she was always decisive and never turned back.

Chu Yao, who had left the teahouse, said impatiently, "Did you see the moat?"

Chu Dao Ji Ling replied, "Yes."

Chu Yao warned him, "If I hear you say that again, I will drown you."

Chu Dao Ji Ling said nothing.

He changed the subject and said, "You are engaged to the Chang family."

Chu Yao replied indifferently, "I expected it. The Chu family was already related to the Chang family, and since I defied my father's will, it's not surprising that I was arranged to marry them. I guess this is the price my father talked about."

Chu Dao Ji Ling commented, "You are taking it well."

Chu Yao replied with a simple "Hmm" and then muttered to herself, "The Demon Cult is in the north desert. It's not a problem to go there, but I heard that the formation is difficult to enter."

Chu Dao Ji Ling warned her, "Have you thought about what might happen if..."

Chu Yao interrupted him, "Then I will come back and follow my father's arrangements."

Chu Dao Ji Ling took back what he said about her being like King Chu. "Compared to her, you are too foolish."

Chu Yao sneered, "Well, thank you for that."

As she spoke, she remained standing in the same spot, looking towards the direction of the Chu family.

It was a family that had been shining in Chang'an for a hundred years, covered in royal glory.

Faint sounds of mourning could be heard.
Chu Yao stood still.

For a long time.

===

Su Chan lightly landed on the ground, her red clothes fluttering.

The people disappeared.

After leaving the boundaries of the Thousand Souls Sect and the Ten Thousand Puppets Formation, those who wanted to go to the Hundred Ghosts Dungeon would directly use the teleportation array.

Su Chan turned around and looked back at the Thousand Souls Sect in the distance.

The Thousand Souls Sect was hazy and indistinct, appearing as a mist to those whose cultivation was not high enough. However, in Su Chan's eyes, everything was clear. What she was looking at was the mountain peak of the Thousand Souls Sect that would light up at night.

That mountain peak was already very far away.

The light was dim.

"..."

Su Chan furrowed her brows slightly, waved her hand, and in the next moment, an ancient map unrolled from her hand. The mountains, rivers, and seas on the parchment paper were illuminated with five colored divine lights: blue, red, yellow, white, and black, making the young girl's face even more enchanting.

If anyone was here, they would recognize that this map was the Nine States Mountains and Rivers Map of the Wind and Moon Continent.

She lightly tapped her finger on it, and in an instant, several places lit up with large patches of red divine light.

White represented prosperous areas, symbolizing the blessings of the gods. Blue represented uninhabited wilderness, where animals and plants were abundant. Yellow represented the lifeless desert. Black represented water flow, while red-

Represented disasters and slaughter.

The emergence of evil spirits and demons on the Evil Spirit Mountain was inevitably bloody. Su Chan glanced at it indifferently, then pulled out the lovesick sword from her sleeve.

The lovesick sword was listless and lacked energy.

The lovesick sword had Xia Ge's aura on it.

Su Chan borrowed a little bit of Xia Ge's aura, wiped it on the map, and a faintly bloody aura slowly curled up in a certain location on the map.

As soon as Su Chan saw the red aura in that breath, her pupils suddenly shrank. She took a look at the location and immediately put away the map and the lovesick sword, disappearing without a trace in the next moment.
This is a dense forest. A girl dressed in white stands in the middle of a pool of blood, the pattern of the amaryllis on her waistband fluttering in the wind. She holds a person in her hand, who has already died with his eyes bulging out.

A butterfly stained with blood lands on the girl's shoulder.

The girl looks at it indifferently, her blood-red pupils devoid of emotion or desire.

The deserted mountain is covered in blood.

Su Chan falls to the ground.

The girl in red seems to merge with the blood flowing on the ground.

The girl looks away from the butterfly with an expressionless face and looks at Su Chan. She is wary of her because she had been hurt by Su Chan before, but she doesn't attack recklessly.

She still has some consciousness, but it has been completely occupied by the curse.

"Let go." Su Chan looks at Xia Ge in white, her voice light and with a smile.

The butterfly on Xia Ge's shoulder flutters its wings slightly, and then the shadow of Chu Yi slowly appears.

She stares at Su Chan, "... Su Chan."

"Nice to meet you, the young master of the Hundred Ghosts Cave." After a pause, he smiled again, "Or should I say... the future head of the Chu family?"

Chu Yi looked at Su Chan for a while, and her mouth curled up slightly, saying, "With the leader's congratulations, Chu Yi is really lucky."

"Being lucky is wonderful." Su Chan also smiled, "But my little priest's happiness, I'm afraid Miss Chu cannot handle it."

"Look at the people Miss Chu brought with her."

The smell of blood around them is strong.

Su Chan's smile is shallow, "Not only can you not help her clear her name, but you will also release a ruthless killer."

Xia Ge stares at Su Chan, ignoring Chu Yi in front of her.

Chu Yi is just an illusion now and will not bring the pleasure of killing to the curse.

Chu Yi smiled, "Do you think I care?"

"Even if she kills everyone in the world." Chu Yi's voice is gentle, "I can still keep her secrets."
Su Chan looked at Chu Yi for a moment, paused for a moment, and smiled, "It's said that Miss Chu lost her mother at a young age and is weak and helpless. But now it seems that Miss Chu is cruel and ruthless, not inferior to me."

Chu Yi responded indifferently, "The world is foolish, unable to see beyond the common rumors. Even the leader believes in the gossip of the neighborhood."

"Haha, Miss Chu is mistaken," Su Chan chuckled. "I never care about rumors, and I don't care what kind of person you are."

"I, Su Chan, do things to achieve my goals, by any means necessary. Sometimes rumors are just a means, and sometimes they can be deadly for some and have no effect on others."

Chu Yi laughed, but her eyes were icy, "Oh? So this is the reason you led her to a dead end?"

Because Su Chan believed that the rumors had no effect on Xia Ge, he cut off all her options, ruthless and merciless.

Su Chan laughed, "Miss Chu is indeed sharp-tongued."

"But Xia Xia is already a little priestess of my demonic sect," Su Chan narrowed her eyes and smiled. "Where is the dead end? The bright path is right behind her."

After a pause, she added, "I really feel guilty for letting my Xia Xia cause so much trouble for Miss Chu."

"But unfortunately," Su Chan said, "this is where it ends."

While the two were talking, Xia Ge had already dropped the dead body in her hand. She looked at Su Chan, her blood-red eyes cold and merciless, as if she was about to attack. However, the moment Su Chan said "this is where it ends," she disappeared in an instant!

Because the butterfly was still on Xia Ge's shoulder, Chu Yi's illusion disappeared in an instant too!

Xia Ge ran away!

Everything around her was retreating. Xia Ge's face was cold, and she moved through the mountains and forests, as light as a clever fox, but her body was covered in the smell of blood after the slaughter.

The dry leaf butterfly tightly clung to her shoulder.

Su Chan did not immediately chase after her. She stood among the bodies, the last person killed by Xia Ge staring angrily with wide eyes, apparently unable to understand what had happened before being sent to the underworld.

Su Chan didn't know why, but she thought of the first time she met Xia Ge in this life.

She pretended to be deeply immersed in her studies, she risked her life to save her, and she vowed, "Trust me, I will definitely save you!"

Su Chan thought of the blood-red eyes that the white-clad girl had just looked at her with.

They were so cold.
It seems like tears frozen into ice.

The passion and radiance in the dark eyes of that child from years ago have now solidified into a slaughter of indifference and the tears of others' blood.

Su Chan walked up to the person who could no longer close their eyes and gently reached out to close them.

That child from years ago.

Crying in those bloody eyes just now.

Su Chan murmured, "Don't cry."

Suddenly, she understood something.

The anxiety from years ago.
