The noon sun was shining brightly. Xia Ge used a fake excuse like "I'm sorry for hurting your leg, so I want to escort you back" and "brothers should love each other" to help Ye Ze back to his temporary residence.

On the way, she was lost in thought, contemplating about the system, transmigration, reality and illusion.

When the system first appeared, she thought it was a hallucination. Later, she realized it was a scam. Then she began to think that her true feelings and experiences were just a joke. In the end, she became numb to it all.

What a colorful journey it had been.

Ah, did you know? The world you have experienced for the past three years, full of true feelings and emotions, is actually just a book.

All the pain, suffering, and hardship you have endured were originally all fake.

Perhaps the people you care about are just pieces of paper.

Oh, maybe not even that. When you look back, they might only be a line of words.

Everyone is just words.

All of it is fake.

And she had lived through three years of true feelings and emotions in this world, which was like a stage set.

Was this destined child, this protagonist, really existing?

On the way back with Ye Ze, Xia Ge kept thinking about this question.

But later, she felt that this question was meaningless.

Because even if she knew this was just a book, no matter how much she complained and blamed others, she would still feel pain, hunger, and sorrow for that girl.

Three years of time, not too long, not too short.

But it was enough for her to live a book as reality.
Everywhere is a place to live, isn't it?

She wasn't a philosopher, so why bother with what's true or false?

Xia Ge steadied herself and thought about the task assigned by the system.

She had read "Boundless Wind and Moon," so this destined son...would be amazing in the future.

His background was tragic, as if his family had been wiped out?

Ah, so that's why he looked so innocent before.

If he becomes so powerful in the future, she should be smarter and cling to his thigh.

Xia Ge followed Ye Ze to a run-down Buddhist temple outside the small town.

This was the dwelling place of the town's beggars, like the headquarters of the beggars' gang.

"This is where I live." Ye Ze's voice was high-pitched and carried a hint of childishness, but he was tall, around 1.67 meters.

It was also because he was tall that Xia Ge mistook him for someone else when she was stealing buns.

In broad daylight, the beggars' children had gone out to beg. In a corner, an old beggar lay on a tattered mat, holding a worn-out fan with a few holes chewed by insects, fanning himself.

"...Can I stay here too?" Xia Ge asked him.

Ye Ze glared at her. "No, you can't."

"Xiao Ze'er." The old beggar, who had been fanning himself with his eyes closed, opened his right eye. "Who is this?"

Ye Ze said, "A beggar."

The old beggar said, "Oh," and continued, "Then let her stay. We don't lack this piece of land."

Ye Ze: "..."

Although the old beggar was old, he seemed to have a lot of influence, and Ye Ze didn't argue with what he said, even though he looked very dissatisfied.
The old beggar fanned himself lazily and glanced at Xia Ge. "We don't have many rules here. Beg during the day, sleep at night, no fighting, and share what you get with others."

Xia Ge nodded absentmindedly, still lost in thought about how to hold onto someone's thigh without looking awkward.

After the old beggar finished speaking, he didn't pay attention to Xia Ge's lack of attention and instead scolded Ye Ze, "Why are you back so early in the day? And without anything to show for it!"

Ye Ze didn't mention how Xia Ge had kicked him in the leg and just walked away. It wasn't a serious injury, but Xia Ge's sweet talk had made him feel like he should have let her help him up.

As Ye Ze left, Xia Ge was about to follow him, but the old beggar stopped her. "Hey, wait a minute."

Xia Ge turned around, confused.

The old beggar fanned himself and opened his eyes, looking at her for a moment before lazily closing them again. "You're a good-looking kid."

He paused before adding, "Long stole your bun, but don't be angry. He's breaking the beggar's rules, and someone will teach him a lesson."

Xia Ge was surprised that the old man knew so quickly. They said the beggars' network was well-informed, and it seemed to be true.

"I already scolded him," Xia Ge said.

"That's your business," the old beggar lifted his eyelid. "You can go with Xiao Ze now."

Xiao Ze...oh, the male lead's name? That gave Xia Ge goosebumps.

As she left the temple, Xia Ge saw the young boy picking a willow branch and shaking it under a nearby tree.

It seemed like he was waiting for her.

Xia Ge skipped over to him.

When Ye Ze saw her, he threw away the branch and started walking away.

"Hey, wait for me," Xia Ge said.

Ye Ze replied, "I don't wait for people with short legs."
Xia Ge: "..." Hmm, don't argue with someone who has the mentality of a young child.

Thinking about the task from the system, Xia Ge paused and then asked seriously, "Hey, do you consider me your little partner now?"

Ye Ze glanced at her disdainfully, "What are you?"

Xia Ge: "..." Alright.

Xia Ge used to beg for food on her own, but now when she begs for food, she can't help but pay attention to whether her little partner has enough to eat.

This feeling is very novel.

At the same time, Xia Ge also noticed that when Ye Ze begs for food, he always has a serious expression on his face and says to people, "Please..."

Before he can say the second word, people often walk away.

He's really a difficult little master to flatter with a smile, Xia Ge thought. I don't know how he has survived all these years, it's so miserable.

Evening quickly arrived.

Unlike Ye Ze, Xia Ge received a lot of copper coins, steamed buns, and buns. Even a lady from a family complimented her sweet smile and gave her a piece of osmanthus cake.

When you want to live well, it won't be so difficult to survive.

She returned with a full load.

In contrast, Ye Ze was very miserable, with only two steamed buns in his arms, looking desolate.

Ye Ze glared at her, "What are you looking at!"

Xia Ge quickly withdrew her gaze, "I wasn't looking at you."

Oh, the Son of Heaven is angry, so scary.

The sun was setting in the west, and the sky quickly turned dark. Ye Ze didn't go back and found a corner to carefully wipe the steamed buns clean and started to nibble on them.

Xia Ge asked, "Why aren't you going back?"

Ye Ze took small bites of the steamed bun and paused for a while before saying, "...It's none of your business."
Xia Ge quickly understood the situation. The rule mentioned by the old beggar was that everyone who saw the food would get a share. Since there were only two mantou buns, it was quite pitiful to have to share them. Xia Ge squatted down next to the old beggar and took a mantou from her own stash to eat. As the night grew darker, Ye Ze finished eating his share, but Xia Ge had only eaten one mantou. Ye Ze looked at Xia Ge's full bag of food and furrowed his brows, "You..." but then decided not to say anything. "Let's go back," he said instead. The two of them returned to the dilapidated temple. There were many beggars sleeping inside, some full and sleeping soundly, while others were still hungry and couldn't sleep. When the old beggar saw Xia Ge and Ye Ze return, he nodded his head in acknowledgement. Some of the beggars who were still awake noticed the food in Xia Ge's hand and immediately exclaimed, "I want a share!" The commotion woke up many people, but the excitement of "seeing the food" was greater than the annoyance of being woken up. Xia Ge's entire stash of food was quickly gone due to the rule of "seeing the food." Ye Ze watched and sneered, not asking for a share himself. The old beggar fanned himself and said nothing. At this point, someone noticed that Xia Ge was a new face and asked, "New here?" Xia Ge nodded and smiled shyly. The people who had received a share of her food silently observed her, and someone grumbled, "The buns aren't even good." But they still ate them all, and the commotion died down quickly. Everyone went back to sleep, as if nothing had happened.
The old beggar fanned himself with his fan and closed his eyes.

It was late at night.

It was somewhat quiet.

Xia Ge had no mat or blanket and didn't want to sleep on the floor of the dilapidated temple. The beggars inside the temple emitted a foul odor that was somewhat unbearable. So she went outside and leaned against the wall with her eyes closed to rest.

Living and sleeping in the open air was a necessary course for beggars. After three years of wandering, she had long gotten used to it.

After a while, someone sat down beside her.

Xia Ge kept her eyes closed and didn't open them.

"Do you think they will be grateful to you for doing this?" Ye Ze whispered. "You're too foolish!"

The "Golden Thigh" who could get two buns in a day called her foolish.

Xia Ge obediently nodded and gave a perfunctory response, "Mm-hmm, I'm too foolish."

Ye Ze: "â€¦"

Ye Ze always felt that something was off, but as a nine-year-old boy, he couldn't figure out what was wrong. He could only pout and get angry.

Xia Ge found it amusing.

Sure enough, the "Golden Thigh" was still just a child.

The moonlight was gentle.

The "Golden Thigh" seemed to have fallen asleep.

Xia Ge opened one eye.

The "Golden Thigh" held his legs and nodded off with his eyes open. He was very tired, but tried to keep his eyes open. However, he soon squinted them shut.

Xia Ge had only eaten one bun, and her stomach growled, waking up the "Golden Thigh" who was about to fall asleep.

He glared at Xia Ge and finally pouted, "You're really foolish."
However, before he could finish speaking, his stomach growled loudly.

It was already late at night, and he had already digested one or two steamed buns long ago, especially during the time of growing taller.

Ye Ze's face visibly turned red.

Xia Ge slowly took out a osmanthus cake from his pocket.

The light fragrance of osmanthus wafted through the air.

Ye Ze suddenly widened his eyes, "You..."

Xia Ge broke the osmanthus cake in half and handed it over to him. Feeling a bit tired and not wanting to explain anything, he lazily said, "Sharing is caring."

Ye Ze: "......"

Xia Ge: "Do you want it?"

Ye Ze really wanted to have some self-respect and say "no", but his stomach growled again.

He was so hungry.

The osmanthus cake smelled so good.

His father had once said that a great man can bend and stretch.

Besides...this was the rule set by the old beggar...if others could share, he could too.

Moreover, this guy looked so stupid.

Xia Ge found it amusing to watch him struggle with his conscience over half a piece of osmanthus cake. It was just half a piece of cake, why did it look so painful?

After a long period of mental struggle, Ye Ze shook his head and said with great dignity, "No!"

Although his father had said that a great man can bend and stretch, he had also said...if you see someone doing something that you think is wrong, then don't be like them.

This person looked even younger than himself, so it was inevitable that he was a bit stupid. Those people inside were bullying him under the guise of "sharing is caring", which was really too much.

His father had once said that he was the only son of the Ye family, carrying the noble blood of the family. Therefore, even if he had to starve, he did not want to become the kind of person he hated.

Ye Ze refused, and Xia Ge thought for a moment before asking, "Is your leg still hurting?"
Ye Ze: "It doesn't hurt anymore. Who do you think I am?"

Xia Ge: "I injured your leg. I owe you a half of a steamed bun."

"How about this? I'll treat you to this half of a osmanthus cake." Xia Ge paused, using polite language, her slightly narrowed eyes widening a bit, the moonlight reflecting in her clear eyes with a faint smile. "You're an adult, just eat a cake and forgive me?"

Ye Ze puffed out his cheeks. "I never blamed you. You're really stupid."

But Xia Ge looked at him, her eyes clear, reflecting the bright moonlight.

In the end, he reached out and carefully took her osmanthus cake. "...Fine, I'll reluctantly forgive you."

Xia Ge didn't say anything either. The two of them crouched in the corner like thieves, devouring the osmanthus cake.

The fragrance of the osmanthus cake wafted into the temple.

Several beggars opened their eyes. Someone wanted to speak, but was glared at and then closed their mouth.

The person scanned the area and, seeing that no one dared to speak, snorted and then closed their eyes as if nothing had happened.

If Xia Ge saw it, she would recognize the beggar who had criticized her steamed bun earlier.

Seeing is not always meaningless.

The old beggar fanned himself and turned over as if nothing had happened.

The little boy was quite friendly and clever.
