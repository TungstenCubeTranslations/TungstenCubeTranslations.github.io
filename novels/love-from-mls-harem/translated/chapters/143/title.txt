Chapter 142: Turning a Blind Eye

The protagonist of the novel had always been someone who couldn't stand injustice. But as he walked down the busy streets of the city, he couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of suffering he saw around him. Homeless people begging for spare change, children selling trinkets on the street, and elderly folks struggling to make ends meet.

He knew he had the power to make a difference, but the more he saw, the more he felt helpless. It was as if he was turning a blind eye to the problems that surrounded him, even though he knew he should be doing something to help.

As he walked, lost in thought, he suddenly heard a commotion up ahead. A group of people were gathered around a young girl, who was crying and pleading with them to let her go. Without hesitation, the protagonist rushed forward to see what was going on.

It turned out that the girl had been kidnapped by a group of human traffickers, who were planning to sell her into slavery. But thanks to the protagonist's quick thinking and bravery, he was able to rescue her and bring her to safety.

In that moment, he realized that even though the problems of the world may seem overwhelming, he could make a difference if he just took action. From that day forward, he vowed to never turn a blind eye to the suffering of others again.
