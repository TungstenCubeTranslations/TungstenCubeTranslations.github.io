The usually obedient young man pulled out the sword from the tree and spoke calmly, "Thank you for giving me the sword, I am grateful... beyond words."

As he said the last two words, he lifted his eyes, and his dark eyes were calm.

"I'll take my leave."

After glancing at Gu Peijiu and the departing Ye Ze, Xia Ge was momentarily dazed and didn't even take a good look at the sword that his senior sister had thrown to Ye Ze.

What just happened?

Xia Ge was a little confused.

Senior sister... oh, senior sister is here.

She was saved.

...Saved?

Xia Ge pulled the corners of her mouth, but found that she couldn't even force a smile.

Just as Xia Ge was lost in thought, Gu Peijiu walked over, reached out and brushed off the grass on her head, her red lips slightly pursed and her face expressionless.

Xia Ge looked up at her.

She felt that her senior sister seemed a little angry.

But her actions were still gentle. She helped Xia Ge brush off the grass and then picked her up horizontally. Xia Ge felt dizzy, and the next moment, the dark persimmon forest had turned into a red maple under the moonlight.

She tugged at her clothes uneasily, and there were a lot of rotten persimmons on the ground. She had just fought with Ye Ze without feeling that anything was wrong, but as soon as she saw her senior sister, she suddenly felt that something was very wrong.

Very wrong.

God knows how much she wanted to teleport back, even if she didn't wear the best clothes, at least she should be clean when meeting people.

It was really embarrassing.

Xia Ge pulled Gu Peijiu's clothes and said obediently, "Senior sister."
"Mm."

Gu Peijiu arrived at the boundary of Danfeng and stopped teleporting. He held her quietly as they walked up the mountain, stepping on the red maple leaves on the ground. Her response was also light.

She whispered, "It's dirty."

Gu Peijiu didn't stop his footsteps and said lightly, "It doesn't matter."

The embrace of the girl was as gentle as the moonlight.

It was so gentle that it seemed that everything that had just happened was a nonexistent nightmare.

Xia Ge muttered, "...I can walk by myself."

Gu Peijiu ignored her and suddenly said, "Don't go to Jianfeng again."

Xia Ge said, "I just went to find my senior sister."

Gu Peijiu paused and repeated stubbornly, "Don't go."

Xia Ge thought of Ye Ze's attitude and felt melancholy. After a while, she buried her head in Gu Peijiu's arms and murmured, "Mm, I won't go."

She whispered, "...it's good that I have a senior sister."

Gu Peijiu didn't say anything.

His lips tightened, but softened a little on his cheeks.

Thinking of what he had just seen, he thought for a moment and said, "I won't let you be sad."

-Ye Ze made you sad, but I won't let you be sad.

Xia Ge didn't understand what she meant, and she pursed her lips. "...I'm not sad."

It was a bit of a stubborn tone.

Ye Ze wasn't worth her sadness, not even a little bit.

That idiot wasn't worth it at all.
Upon arriving at Xia Ge's small house, Gu Peijiu put her down and gently patted her head with her white hand. "Hmm."

After a pause, she said, "Go rest early."

She didn't mention anything about Xia Ge playing the flute, nor did she say anything, as if she hadn't seen anything at all.

Suddenly, Xia Ge felt that there was no point in being strong, so when Gu Peijiu was about to turn around, she suddenly reached out and grabbed her sleeve.

Gu Peijiu turned to look at her.

Under the faint moonlight, the girl's long and thick eyelashes cast a shadow on her eyes.

Xia Ge looked up and said, "I... am not sad."

She thought for a moment and said, "Maybe I'm just a little bit upset."

Gu Peijiu looked at her.

Xia Ge looked at her seriously. "But if I could soak in a hot spring and wash away my troubles, maybe I wouldn't be upset anymore."

Gu Peijiu took a deep breath.

= =

The hot spring water was warm.

Xia Ge immersed herself in it, with the warm water swirling around her, feeling so comfortable that she just wanted to roll around in it.

"Ah..."

She dunked her head into the water, "Mmm..."

Empty her mind.

What is Ye Ze? Can it be eaten? No, it cannot be eaten.

Why bother thinking about things that cannot be eaten?

Don't think about it.

"Huh..."
Taking her almost oxygen-deprived head out of the spring water, Xia Ge said, "Senior sister, I think..."

However, she looked around and didn't see her senior sister's shadow.

"Huh?"

The mist from the hot spring water filled the air, making everything hazy.

"Senior sister?"

After wandering in the hot spring for a while, Xia Ge realized that her senior sister hadn't come down.

Was it because she thought Xia Ge was too dirty?

Xia Ge thought of the rotten persimmons in the persimmon forest and herself rolling on them.

Xia Ge: "..."

Well, how should she put it?

This kind of thing was really mystical.

Xia Ge decided to shut up, not think about anything, and just take a good bath.

However, while washing, she suddenly stopped again and subconsciously looked at her hands.

Her hands were white and tender, and a little small.

She realized belatedly.

Thinking that her senior sister might be here, she didn't have that...very disgusted feeling.

Xia Ge was stunned for a while.

...What was this?

Did her germophobia heal itself?

On the other hand.

The girl wore a plain white dress, her white and tender feet stepping on wooden clogs. She gazed at the emerald green hair tie in her hand, her long eyelashes casting thick shadows under the flickering candlelight, but she didn't move for a long time.
Faintly came a soft voice "Senior Sister" from the little girl.

Gu Peijiu paused slightly, the soft hair band in her hand suddenly tightened, and she didn't even respond to the last sentence.

The other side called out once and then stopped, looking dejected, as if the one call was just a casual remark.

Gu Peijiu didn't know why, but suddenly felt a little angry.

But it was only a little.

Finally, she neatly put away the hair band, took out her yukata from the side, and Tianzhu Ling slowly opened a drawer in the cabinet and took out some needles and thread.

Although she really wanted to stay in the hot spring for a while longer, she felt like it might not be appropriate. Xia Ge had already climbed up, smelling fragrant after washing herself, and as soon as she came up, she saw Tianzhu Ling twisting her waist like a red snake, holding up a snow-white yukata with her "head" and a pair of wooden clogs with her "tail".

She handed the clothes to Xia Ge, arranged the wooden clogs for her, and then twisted her waist and slid into the hot spring slowly.

Xiangsi jumped down from her head and also jumped into the water.

Tianzhu Ling and Xiangsi were entangled together, looking very intimate.

Xia Ge held the clothes and said, "..."

Xia Ge changed into her clothes, quietly opened the door while wearing the wooden clogs, and peeked inside.

She saw Gu Peijiu, wearing revealing clothes, sitting on the bed and reading by the flickering candlelight.

Xia Ge blinked, walked over with a clatter, and boldly took the book from her hand. "Don't read it."

Gu Peijiu looked up at her, her pupils suddenly shrinking, and then she averted her gaze. "...Tie up your clothes properly!"

Xia Ge belatedly lowered her head to look.

The yukata she was wearing seemed to belong to Senior Sister, and the length had been shortened, but she seemed to not know how to sew, and the chest area had not been altered.

Xia Ge was used to being rough and didn't care much. She just tied the yukata loosely around her waist, and wearing the wooden clogs, she came over. She even acted like a child, bending over, and from Gu Peijiu's perspective, she could see everything she shouldn't have seen.

Xia Ge looked down, rubbed her head, casually tidied up, and didn't take it to heart. "Senior Sister, don't read under the candlelight, it will hurt your eyes."

Gu Peijiu: "..."

The flickering candlelight illuminated the wet hair of the little girl in the snow-white yukata, her cheeks were soft, her bright eyes and white teeth, thin and small, and her small feet in the wooden clogs were also white and tender.
Gu Peijiu put down her book and picked up a nearby towel. "Head."

Xia Ge blinked and obediently leaned on Gu Peijiu's leg. Gu Peijiu covered her head with the towel and carefully wiped off the wet droplets on her hair.

Her senior sister's hands were very gentle and comfortable.

"..." Xia Ge thought for a moment and asked knowingly, "Senior sister, who is locked up in prison?"

"Prisoners," Gu Peijiu replied.

"..." Xia Ge pulled her sleeve and asked, "Can you tell me who specifically?"

"Qin Yue," Gu Peijiu said.

As expected, it was her.

Xia Ge pretended to be surprised and said, "Ah? It's her."

Gu Peijiu raised an eyebrow slightly, and her black eyes were faintly sharp.

"..." Xia Ge thought her reaction seemed a bit fake. It seemed that her senior sister knew that she already knew.

But Gu Peijiu obviously didn't want to expose her, and Xia Ge shamelessly asked, "How is she doing now?"

Gu Peijiu obviously had no interest in the daily life of a suspect. "Very good."

"..." Xia Ge was speechless.

Gu Peijiu dried her hair and put the towel away. Xia Ge didn't want to get up and lay on her leg, "Senior sister, can I sleep here tonight?"

Gu Peijiu's long eyelashes trembled slightly, and she didn't speak for a while.

But the hand under her wide sleeve tightened slightly.

Xia Ge tugged at her clothes and whispered, "Senior sister, I'm afraid of the dark. Let me sleep here for one night, just one night."

"Is that okay?"
She didn't want to be alone tonight.

Being alone would make her feel uncomfortable. And when feeling uncomfortable, she couldn't help but want to compromise with something.

Gu Peiju said, "Okay."

"Really?!"

"Mm."

"Sister, you're so kind!"

Gu Peiju said, "...I'm going to take a bath."

Xia Ge was very enthusiastic. "I'll help you dry your hair later, Sister!"

Gu Peiju said, "..."

At midnight, Gu Peiju woke up.

There was no disaster in her dream, and everything was peaceful.

She woke up only because...

The little girl under the soft blanket was curled up like a shrimp, and now the shrimp was trying to crawl into her arms.

Gu Peiju said, "..."

She silently let the girl crawl closer to her. After a while, the little shrimp automatically crawled into her arms and found a comfortable position to lie down.

Resting her head on Gu Peiju's chest, she looked very comfortable.

Gu Peiju furrowed her brows, sighed, hugged the girl, and then closed her eyes.

The warmth in her arms warmed her heart.

Gu Peiju thought, this is nice.

Just as she was thinking this, she suddenly felt a slight warmth and dampness on her chest.
It looked like tears.

Gu Peijiu stiffened slightly.

The little girl didn't move much, still curled up like a shrimp. Gu Peijiu lowered her head slightly and, by the moonlight shining through the green window, vaguely saw tears at the corners of her eyes.

She was really crying.

Silently, tears moistened her eyelashes.

Tears in her dreams.

Gu Peijiu trembled slightly, feeling a dense pain in her chest.

...Why wouldn't she be sad?

Perhaps she just didn't know who to talk to.

Gu Peijiu thought of the scene she saw on the hillside tonight.

The little girl in her night clothes sat on a branch with closed eyes, playing a flute. A blue deer lay under the tree, and a spirit guardian danced to the sound of the flute.

The scene was enchanting and made people stop in their tracks.

At that time, Gu Peijiu stood behind the tree and watched for a long time.

That was not a puppeteer that everyone despised.

That was the girl who had captured her heart.

Gu Peijiu lowered her head and kissed away the tears on her eyelashes one by one. Then she hugged the girl tightly and slowly closed her eyes.

It's okay, she'll wait.

She'll wait for the girl to trust her and confess all her sadness, sorrow, happiness, and silence.

...Or, she'll wait for her to learn to love.

She's not a puppeteer.
She was the beloved young lady.

Chang Nian leaned casually against a parasol tree, flipping through a notebook in his hand, his gaze showing a hint of sharpness.

After a while, he closed the book and looked at the figure not far away. "…You said this is the account book of the Chu family for the past three years?"

The person wearing a silver-white cloak replied in a low, mechanical voice, "Yes."

"Oh?" Chang Nian slightly hooked his lips. "This is really interesting. We disciples who practice cultivation never care about worldly affairs. Why did you bring this here?"

"I just believe that the master will be interested in it." The cloaked person interrupted him, his voice low. "I heard that the master recently obtained the Skyshine, so we naturally seek some protection."

Chang Nian narrowed his eyes.

The cloaked person reached out and gestured to take back the account book. "Of course, if the young master is unwilling, we will..."

"Wait a minute." Chang Nian put away the account book. "Why would I be unwilling?"

"Fair exchange, a very fair transaction." Chang Nian said, "The Hundred Ghosts Cave, very sincere."

"So be it, very good."

The night was slightly dark. A silver butterfly hidden among the leaves quietly turned into silver dust and scattered.

Chu Yi stood quietly on the cliff behind the Sword Peak, the cold wind blowing her hair, and she stared at the endless abyss below her feet, with silver butterflies flying around her.

"Take it slow." She whispered, "Don't be in a hurry...don't be."
