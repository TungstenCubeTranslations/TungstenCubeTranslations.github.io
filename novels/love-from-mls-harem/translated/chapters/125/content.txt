The illusion had already vanished. Xia Ge stood outside the gate of retrospection, motionless for a while.

Chu Yi leaned against the gate with her eyes closed, seemingly in a coma. The system said, "She should have entered the gate of retrospection."

"Everyone can go back to the past through the gate of retrospection, but some people can only let their souls enter, while others can let their bodies enter."

Xia Ge didn't ask why. She stood there in a daze, with bamboo swords and black cloaks stained with blood flashing in her mind, and the face that was familiar enough to make her soul tremble.

Senior Sister.

Was that Senior Sister?

...No, it wasn't.

She called her...Shuangshuang.

After a while, she looked down at the snow-white key in her hand and asked belatedly, "When will she wake up?"

Chu Yi.

The system hesitated for a moment, "It depends on what she encounters."

"People whose souls enter the gate of retrospection often have stronger obsessions and delusions than ordinary people." The system seemed to imply something, "The more carefree a person is, the more lenient the gate of retrospection will be."

"Because the more a person doesn't care about anything, the less likely they are to change the past." The system demonstrated alone, "The more someone has deep obsessions..."

The more they will think about how things would have been better if they had done something back then, and the easier it is for them to intervene in past events.

"So when will she wake up?" Xia Ge interrupted it.

The system said, "..."

After a while, the system whispered, "I said...it depends on what she encounters."

What was she thinking?

Xia Ge was silent for a while, looking at the girl leaning against the gate, her soft black hair and long eyelashes like butterfly wings, sitting quietly on the ground like a perfect puppet.

Xia Ge looked down at the key in her hand again.
The system kindly reminded, "Shengmen, one key can only open one person's door."

Meaning, it was impossible to take Chu Yi out unless Chu Yi...could bring back the key.

How did the key appear?

Thinking back, it was completely inexplicable.

"...How can a key appear?" Xia Ge asked.

The system replied, "...I'm not sure about the specifics, but according to legend, when someone without obsession develops one, the key will appear. As for those with obsessions, it's not so clear...but of course, it's just a legend."

Xia Ge sat next to Chu Yi, took out a Peigu Dan and fed it to Chu Yi, then ate one herself to restore her energy.

They had to wait for Little Butterfly to come back.

It didn't matter, she wasn't in a hurry.

The system just said that someone who didn't care about anything could develop an obsession, and the key would appear.

Slowly opening her palm, the snow-white key was in her hand, like the soft petals of a blooming white orchid.

Obsession?

Xia Ge thought, it shouldn't be considered an obsession.

It was just that moment.

She really wanted to know what kind of role the person who looked so much like Senior Sister had played in her confused past.

---

The dark cave.

There was a...not very pleasant smell.

A faint, nauseating bloody scent.

Su Chan walked forward carelessly. The illusions of the White Dream Cave were numerous, but in her dark pupils, these illusions were like children's jokes, not worth mentioning.
She still wore Mao Qing's coat, with the blood-stained Dan Feng Su Yi made from the autumn leaves draped over her, giving her an indescribable feeling.

Wearing someone else's skin, living a different life.

Thinking back to the whisper of the young man in her midnight dream and the silly and impulsive moment when Bai Meng Cave appeared.

She had never liked owing anyone anything.

And also.

Su Chan thought that even though she was in someone else's identity, occasionally encountering such an interesting person in her boring and long life was quite fun.

However, she came to Bai Meng Cave not only to rescue this interesting person but also for another reason.

Occasionally, the stone cave passage would move and block her path, but Su Chan remained calm and went with the flow, taking whichever path was available until she finally arrived at an open space.

The ground of this open space was covered with salt crystals, shining white and out of place in the dark cave. Su Chan paused and took out a bone flute.

The bone flute was crystal clear, with a bright red silk knot tied to the end, swaying slightly with her movements.

"This flute... Bone Sorrow."

She stood in front of the open space, her thoughts slightly drifting, then she returned to reality.

She sat down and played a tune.

The melodious flute sound floated in the stuffy stone cave, and the overlapping echoes rippled. The cave changed several times, and the beautiful salt crystals in the open space shimmered with a bloody light with the sound of the flute. Then, the blood salt in the center slowly rose, and the beautiful salt crystals fell like flowing sand. Finally, a small wooden frame appeared, with a small box on top.

If Xia Ge were here, she would surely notice that the box was eight percent similar to the box she recognized as the ashes of the old ancestor in the tomb before.

Su Chan reached out, and the box flew up in the air, then landed steadily in her hand.

Su Chan opened the box, and the second piece of the map leading to Evil Spirit Mountain was inside. She closed the box, with a faint smile on her lips, and a hint of charm in her eyes and brows, even on Mao Qing's face.

"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step..." She murmured to herself, "and it's effortless to get something for nothing?"

Four pieces of the map, one in the old ancestor's tomb, one in the Dream God's residence.

Everyone knew that the old ancestor's tomb was in the back mountain, but the maze set up by Su Chan herself was also overlapping, hiding the entrance to the tomb tightly. Even though Su Chan had eyes and ears everywhere, she still had a hard time finding it under the maze's web of obstacles. If it weren't for the lost deer leading the child to the tomb, she might not have found any clues by now.

The child who was led to the tomb by the lost deer...
If it wasn't for Baiguai's lack of response, she would have almost thought it was-

But... Su Chan thought of the foolishness of the child before, and smiled inexplicably.

Xia Wushuang was a bit stupid, but she wouldn't risk her life for a casual acquaintance.

This time, finding the White Dream Cave, that child also made a significant contribution, right?

She withdrew her wandering thoughts.

Although the remaining two clues were unclear, it shouldn't be difficult to figure out the general direction after the High Priest returned to the sect. Su Chan picked up the flute. Before that, she would first go and look for that foolish child.

The sound of the flute drifted, and the illusions were layered upon each other. If someone was present, they would be surprised to see the various scenes of the White Dream Cave passing by in the illusion, finally condensing on the young man sitting between the black and white doors.

The young man wore a crimson robe, with a smiling doll at his waist, and a slightly smaller, soft and shiny black-haired girl leaning next to him.

Both of them had their eyes closed, but the young man seemed to be meditating, while the girl appeared to be unconscious.

The bone flute in Su Chan's hand tightened slightly.

For some reason, Su Chan didn't like seeing other people around this young man.

Su Chan looked at Xia Ge, who had long eyelashes and closed eyes, and thought inexplicably.

He couldn't be called a young man.

He was Xia Xia.

Su Chan slightly raised the corners of her mouth. She went to look at the two doors behind the young man.

The black door was covered with mysterious runes, while the white door had a keyhole.

Su Chan recognized them as the Retrospective Door and the Door of Life in the White Dream Cave.

Xia Ge moved and revealed a corner of the white key in her hand.

-The key to the Door of Life?

Does that mean she has already been to the Retrospective Door? And has she obtained the key?
What kind of past could a child that young have to generate such an obsession?

Su Chan found it interesting again.

The Gate of Retrospection can be said to be the source of power for the entire White Dream Cave.

Those who enter the Gate of Retrospection will go back in time. There are countless streams of history, and everything has a past.

Everyone has a different past.

And the Gate of Retrospection will entice people with the key to the door of life, allowing them to enter the Gate of Retrospection. Under the premise that the past cannot be changed, they collect what this person sees and feels about the past.

With these, White Dream Cave creates even more bewildering illusions.

However, there are always some people who are not easily shaken by the past and illusions. They are commonly known as carefree or strong-willed people. These people will make the Gate of Retrospection confused in collecting "emotions and thoughts of people in different pasts". In the end, they will choose to show them something different from what they saw in the past and observe from a different perspective, enticing them to generate new feelings and obsessions.

Once an obsession is generated, the Gate of Retrospection completes its task, and the key to exit will appear.

"Since we have the key..." Su Chan glanced at the unconscious girl next to Xia Ge and sneered, "Let's leave early."

She liked how this child was foolish towards her.

But she didn't want this child to be foolish towards everyone.

The mournful sound of the white bone flute lingered on her lips.

This flute sound, in the gloomy and dark stone passage, strangely had no echo, as if it had penetrated into the stone wall and slowly spread, permeating.

Slowly, with low tones.

With a tempting and lulling tone.

Xia Ge originally closed her eyes just to rest, but for some reason, she gradually fell into a sweet dream.

The flute sound slowly became lower.

There was a faint meaning of comfort and temptation.

Xia Ge slept soundly with her eyes closed, but her body slowly moved. She stood up, and the key in her hand was stiffly inserted into the lock of the Gate of Life.

The white Gate of Life.
"The white key.

Turn.

The door opened.

A bright white light enveloped the sleeping Xia Ge, taking her away from the dreamlike dwelling of the Dream God, and then plunging her into a deeper, darker dream.

This dream had no end.

The key disappeared, and the door closed.

Su Chan put down his flute and looked at Chu Yi who had been left behind, laughing softly, "I'll give you a ride."

-Don't thank me.

For a long time.

Maybe not that long.

Chu Yi slowly opened her eyes.

Still, she couldn't see anything.

The door flickered with a faint light.

But these eyes that couldn't see anything made her feel desperate and reluctant when she looked back at the past through the Door of Retrospection.

"...Brother?" Chu Yi murmured, "Don't...leave me."

The only answer for her was the silence of the room.

There was nothing.

The voice of misfortune sounded.

Cruel and ruthless.

"He's gone."

Her eyes were still in darkness."
Chu Yi pondered.

The little butterfly's dream had ended.

But the night was still very long.
