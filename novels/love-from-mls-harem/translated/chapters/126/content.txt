The leaves in the bamboo forest swayed with the clouds and sunlight. Gu Peijiu followed the young girl, walking forward. The girl had a face like Xia Wuyin, was dressed in a snow-white dress and cloth boots, carried a basket on her back, and had a smooth bone flute inserted into her waist, with each joint of the flute polished to a shine.

"These past few days, the princess has been away," the girl walked ahead, seemingly talking to herself. "The princess's mushroom soup is the best... ha, but it doesn't matter."

She turned her head and smiled brightly at Gu Peijiu. "My skills are not bad either."

Gu Peijiu's footsteps faltered slightly, her heart skipping a beat.

The girl finished speaking and turned her head to continue walking, her steps light. "But now that you mention it, you probably can't eat it... You don't talk, and even when we rescued that girl from Cloud City, you couldn't keep me company. Sigh, the days when the princess is away are really as lonely as snow."

Gu Peijiu remained silent.

It seemed that the speaker was used to her silence and didn't mind. After complaining to herself, she continued walking leisurely, occasionally picking up a piece of bamboo and pulling it, and occasionally squatting down to pick a few tender bamboo shoots from inside and throwing them into the basket.

It wasn't until the sunset that the brilliant red glow of the sun dyed the clouds red that the girl looked at the mushrooms and bamboo shoots in the basket and smiled, "Mm... that's enough, let's go back."

... Who are you?

The doubts in her heart grew stronger and stronger, but her expression remained silent all the way.

Following the girl, Gu Peijiu arrived at a small bamboo house. Wooden fences surrounded it, with purple morning glories climbing up them. Soft sunlight poured down, and there was also a high bamboo frame outside the house, with winding grape vines climbing up it. Chili peppers and some other small crops emitted a strong vitality. It was picturesque, full of greenery.

Inside the fence, a little girl in red bit her lip, her black hair soft on her shoulders. She stood barefoot on the green stone outside the bamboo house, her narrow eyebrows and eyes fixedly watching the girl with the basket. Under her large red sleeves, her hand was slightly clenched.

"Oh? Why don't you come in?" The girl had just opened the fence door, and the little girl in red, like a red butterfly, jumped off the green stone and ran to the girl, hugging her waist and leaning her head against her chest, unwilling to let go.

"..."

Gu Peijiu watched from behind, tilting her head slightly, her black pupils calm and unruffled. This scene... seemed familiar, but she couldn't remember where she had seen it before.

It was the same as before.
She never used to dream or have any excess emotions.

But since she met Xia Wuyin,

Something seems to be slowly awakening in her.

She seems to have a very distant memory, but the memory is fuzzy, and there is always one person who remains clear.

That child named Xia Wuyin.

In all her dreams, in all the familiar memories, that important person always has Xia Wuyin's face.

It's like someone is reminding her of something, deliberately.

At first, she thought Xia Wuyin had drugged her, and she was alert, suspicious, and confused.

But when that child was by her side...

Gu Peijiu closed her eyes, then opened them again and stared at the back of the girl in front of her, her black pupils slowly deepening.

No drugs.

It was her own loss of control.

She didn't want that child to have any hidden feelings towards her, she wanted her to trust her completely, she wanted to see her, to be gentle with her, to love her.

There was even something deeper... something that shouldn't be there, permeating her heart.

...She wanted her.

Very much.

"Didn't I tell you to wait inside?"

The girl laughed lightly, and the clouds shone brightly. The grapes hidden among the green leaves were like purple jade. She bent down and touched the little girl's head in red clothes. "Shall I take you inside?"

The little girl looked up, didn't say anything, just glanced at her, and finally grabbed her sleeve. Her long, narrow eyes looked at Gu Peijiu behind her, and her black eyes were full of hostility.

- This is mine.

Those bright, light-reflecting eyes clearly wrote a possessive desire.
Gu Peijiu's eyes darkened as she looked at the little girl, feeling a faint chill in her heart.

Just as the girl was about to carry the bamboo basket and hold the little girl's hand to go in, the bamboo door opened by itself.

Chu Shi's hair was tied up high, her light brown almond eyes were bright, and she was wearing exquisite silver armor. The tight-fitting clothes outlined her well-proportioned waist and chest. She leaned against the door frame with her arms crossed, with a faint smile on her lips.

The girl was slightly stunned, "Princess? When did you come back?"

Chu Shi's voice was light, "I heard you came back, so I came."

Princess?

Was she the princess that she had been thinking of? And who was this person... called Wu Shuang?

Gu Peijiu paused for a moment, then turned to see the little girl in red holding onto the girl's clothes, her white wrist contrasting against the red sleeve, and her fingers tightly clenched.

The bones of her fingers were white.

She was exerting a lot of force.

The girl didn't feel anything was wrong and said with a smile, "Let me introduce you to a little girl. I brought her back from the capital. She doesn't have a name yet..."

"Why did you go?" Chu Shi suddenly interrupted her.

The girl called Wu Shuang paused for a moment, then smiled, "I just wanted to go. Who has time to think about this and that?"

"Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you about the person behind me..." 

"I told you, I didn't ask you to change my fate." Chu Shi's voice was cold and clear, but her fists were clenched. "Even if you don't change my fate, I can still become king."

There was a hint of frustration.

"...will die young." The girl said softly.

Chu Shi said, "That doesn't matter."

The girl called Wu Shuang laughed, her cat-like eyes showing a hint of mockery, "But I can't bear to lose you."

The little girl in red looked at Chu Shi, her eyes slightly cold.
"Don't give me nonsense. Have you ever thought about what defying fate represents?" Chu Shi took a deep breath, but still felt the frustration building up in her chest. "Why is it that the Cloud City is so high and mighty, and everyone knows that fate is determined by the Cloud City, yet no one dares to touch the book of fate? Xia Wushuang, have you ever thought--"

"I have thought about it."

"You thought about it and still did it?! What did my uncle give you in return?! Land or a title?! Tell me, I can give you anything--"

"Princess!"

"Anything," Chu Shi said.

"..."

Chu Shi and Xia Wushuang stared at each other for a long time.

After a while, Chu Shi averted her eyes slightly and whispered, "Wushuang, those things...aren't worth it."

"They're not worth you doing that."

Gu Peijiu watched silently from behind. She was like a spectator who had wandered into the past. Even though she was an outsider, even her clothes were wrong, these people seemed to selectively ignore her and treat her as the person they thought she was.

They were acting out a story that had already happened.

"Princess, the national chancellor never promised me anything."

"It's just that I had a wish."

The girl's pitch-black eyes gleamed, and she gazed at Chu Shi with a faint smile on her lips. Her voice was slow. "During the years when I didn't know who I was..."

Chu Shi's fist clenched slightly, and her light brown eyes glimmered. After a moment, she closed her eyes.

She heard the girl's soft voice in her ear.

"Live simply, and have simple wishes."

Chu Yi closed her eyes, her fist clenched tightly. "...Don't say it."

But Xia Wushuang's voice was soft. "I only hope to see the princess and rule the world in my lifetime."

"May I see the princess and reign over the world."
但总有一天，我们会醒来的。
"But in the end, it's time to wake up."

The intense golden lightning suddenly broke through the sky's purple mist!

"Boom!"

An explosive wave spread out! The illusion collapsed under the lightning, and the red threads instantly turned into red silk, wrapping around her as she broke through the acupoint at the moment before the collapse of the Bai Meng Cave space!

Her body kept falling, as if she would fall into endless void, never to reach the end.

Before the last illusion shattered, Gu Peiju lifted her head, and then her pupils slightly contracted!

The shattered illusion continued to fall with her, and in the blurry image, the girl called Wu Shuang sat on a bluestone slab, holding a bone flute in her hand, propping her chin with a smile, calling out to her, "Hey, Ajie..."

The girl's figure shattered completely.

Disappeared without a trace.

Then, a woman wearing a black cloak flashed by, and in Gu Peiju's shrinking pupils, she gently lifted her black veil.

Revealing a face that was exactly the same as hers, her black eyes quietly staring at her.

One second before the Bai Meng Cave shattered.

The woman spoke.

Couldn't hear it.

But the lip movements were probably--

As the rocks and illusions shattered together, with the sound of the Bai Meng Cave collapsing, the painful roar of the Jiaolong, her voice was annihilated.

Gu Peiju murmured the woman's words: "Flowers bloom...two-faced?"

--Between the Buddha and the demon in life.
