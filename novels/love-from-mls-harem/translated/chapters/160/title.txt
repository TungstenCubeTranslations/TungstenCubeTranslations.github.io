Chapter 159: If Later

如果以后，他们分开了，她会怎么样呢？

If later, if they were to separate, what would she do?

她曾经问过自己这个问题，但她从未真正思考过答案。现在，当这个问题再次出现在她脑海中时，她感到了一阵恐惧。

She had asked herself this question before, but she had never really thought about the answer. Now, when this question appeared in her mind again, she felt a wave of fear.

她不知道自己是否能够承受失去他的痛苦。她不知道自己是否能够继续前行，继续生活。

She didn't know if she could bear the pain of losing him. She didn't know if she could continue to move forward, to continue living.

她想起了他曾经对她说过的一句话：“无论发生什么事情，我都会在你身边。”

She remembered a sentence he had said to her before: "Whatever happens, I will be by your side."

她相信他的话，但她也知道，生活中有太多的不确定性。如果有一天，他不能再陪伴在她身边，她会怎么办呢？

She believed his words, but she also knew that there were too many uncertainties in life. If one day, he could no longer be by her side, what would she do?

她不知道答案，但她知道，她会珍惜眼前的一切，珍惜他，珍惜他们之间的感情。

She didn't know the answer, but she knew that she would cherish everything in front of her, cherish him, cherish the relationship between them.
