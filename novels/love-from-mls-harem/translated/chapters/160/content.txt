"We must find that place," said Dou Dou, her voice soft but determined. "I...I must send them back."

Summer heard her.

Resting her chin on her hand, Summer said, "I see."

Dou Dou looked at Summer in front of the campfire. The young girl had skin as white as jade, and her delicate hands casually picked up a small stick. Her eyes were lazy, with a hint of indifference, and her face showed no impatience or annoyance, only a sense of carefree nonchalance.

She was a very beautiful older sister.

Dou Dou felt a little flutter in her heart.

Although she had forgotten what it was like to be moved, seeing her...it seemed like she remembered.

Dou Dou stared at her rosy lips, and the flickering of the campfire made Summer's expression change constantly.

She was so pretty, Dou Dou thought...she wanted to kiss her.

But the sister would definitely not allow it. You are such a pervert.

Dou Dou blushed a little.

A firefly flew out of her hand.

Dou Dou watched the firefly fly away, and subconsciously wanted to reach out and catch it. She saw her own translucent hand and suddenly felt a little sad.

Everything will...fly away.

Dou Dou felt a little disappointed.

"Dou Dou." Summer's voice suddenly sounded.

Dou Dou turned around and looked at Summer in front of the campfire. For some reason, she suddenly felt a little nervous.

"Did I forget to tell you my name?" Summer threw a match into the fire, feeling a little embarrassed. She paused and said, "My name is Xia Ge."

Dou Dou was stunned, then her face turned slightly red, and she repeated softly, "...Xia...Xia, Ge."

"Summer as in summer, and Ge as in singing," Summer said. "If I forget my name, you have to remind me in the future."


Xia Ge yawned, feeling a bit tired. She muttered to herself, somewhat self-deprecatingly, "Hmm, if there is a future."

- The future.

It was a long time before Dou Dou came back to her senses. She whispered, "I will always remember."

But the girl named Xia Ge had already fallen into a deep sleep.

Dou Dou floated over to her side, gently touching her forehead with her soft hand. "Hmm, the future."

She didn't know if there was a future, but she liked saying the word.

Whether there was or not, it sounded gentle.

It was dawn.

Xia Ge put out the campfire and continued on the road with Dou Dou.

They passed by a village, and Xia Ge went in to inquire about news.

She asked a woman holding a basket of old clothes, "Excuse me... do you know where there are more peach blossoms nearby?"

The woman was thin and sickly-looking, and life had not been kind to her. When she heard Xia Ge's question, she looked her up and down, her voice cold as ice. "The princess of the dynasty has been kidnapped by bandits. With war raging and people dying, who has the time to look at peach blossoms?"

Xia Ge: "..."

Dou Dou, her soul floating behind her, tugged on her sleeve nervously, afraid of the woman.

Xia Ge smiled and took out a mountain chicken, her expression sincere. "Sister, I mean no harm..."

The chicken was snatched away in a flash, and the woman threw down her clothes, hugged the chicken, and pointed in a direction. "Go west!"

Xia Ge: "..."

They say the human heart is fickle.

It seemed like it hadn't changed much in ancient times.

Xia Ge continued westward with Dou Dou and finally came across a village where peach blossoms were grown.

It seemed to be a village that brewed peach blossom wine, and Xia Ge caught a strong whiff of alcohol.
Although it was only a few scattered blossoms, it seemed like they had just bloomed and it was worth celebrating. Xia Ge was about to go there with Dou Dou, but as they approached, Dou Dou stopped.

"What's wrong?" Xia Ge asked strangely.

Dou Dou looked uneasy, "There seems to be something strange."

"Something strange? Isn't this your home?" Xia Ge asked.

Dou Dou hesitated, "I don't know, I don't remember, but... it feels strange."

Xia Ge glanced at the "strange village". They had been walking for five or six days, and it seemed that only the peach blossoms here were in bloom.

If this was not the place, they would have to go even further.

Moreover... she didn't know if it was an illusion.

Xia Ge raised her hand and looked at her nails.

Her nails were originally very long, but now... they had shrunk a little?

It must be an illusion.

She scratched her head, "Wait here, I'll go take a look."

Although it was a village that brewed wine, it was very quiet inside. In this season when the peach blossoms had not yet bloomed, they were indeed in full bloom here and very beautiful.

But it was also very strange.

There was not a single person inside.

Xia Ge looked around and came out strangely, "There's no one inside... take a look..."

Her voice suddenly stopped.

The little ghost who was supposed to be waiting there had disappeared without a trace.

...Gone!

Gone!
"Doudou?!"

= =

The location where the evil spirits appeared was in the south of the Fengyue continent.

Strange beasts with huge wings soared in the dim sky, their low and terrifying roars echoing around the pitch-black mountains and rivers. Their sharp claws seemed capable of tearing through the air.

Strange and eerie roars could be heard faintly.

The Evil Spirit Mountain was more like a giant mountain range forming a walled city. The things inside couldn't come out, and the people outside couldn't get in.

Gu Peijiu and her group stopped and found a place to rest. It was a tavern located where the Evil Spirit Mountain descended into the Southern Ten-Li Mountains. After the Demon Sect released the news, people came in waves like leeks, and the business of the tavern naturally boomed.

"Are there really clothes demons?"

"Definitely."

"..."

The tavern was bustling with people, and some were feeling stuffy. Gu Peijiu looked at the wine on the table for a while, then left the tavern.

There were many people accompanying Lingxi Peak this time, such as Ye Ze and Chang Nian who came later from Jianfeng, and some people who came from Beast Peak.

The disciple who followed her out asked, "Senior Sister?"

"I'm going out for a walk. Keep an eye on the news," Gu Peijiu said.

"Okay."

The disciple, Lu Qie, looked at Gu Peijiu and felt that she seemed to have something on her mind.

"Why don't you go?" Gu Peijiu glanced at him. "Do you want to go back and copy books again?"

"No, no, I'll go now!" Lu Qie hurriedly went back.

After he left, Gu Peijiu looked up and saw the winding Evil Spirit Mountain in the distance, its dark and gloomy atmosphere making her feel very uncomfortable. She looked at it for a while, but her thoughts returned to Xia Wuyin.
Xia Wu Yin.

In an instant, it felt like she was transported back to Dan Feng. The child slowly grew taller and her thin hands gained some soft flesh. Then, on a night when the lanterns were lit, she accidentally held her hand.

"Senior sister, there are so many people here."

Gu Pei Jiu held her hand. "Mm."

The little girl's voice was a bit shy. "You have to hold me. If I get lost, you won't find another me."

Gu Pei Jiu tightened her grip. "...Mm."

Just as Gu Pei Jiu was thinking, a strange feeling suddenly surged into her heart. Tian Zhu Ling moved slightly, as if sensing lovesickness.

She glanced to the side and saw a somewhat familiar figure turning into a corner.

Gu Pei Jiu's pupils shrank slightly. Xia Wu Yin?!

The next moment, Gu Pei Jiu flashed to that corner.

However, there was nothing there.

Nothing at all.

Gu Pei Jiu clenched Tian Zhu Ling in her hand.

...Did she come too?

If she came, why didn't she see her?

Was it... that she didn't want to see her, or that she hadn't made up her mind yet? Then... why did she come to Evil Spirit Mountain?

Did she come to see her?

For some inexplicable reason, Gu Pei Jiu felt a bit panicked. When she was concerned, she became confused, and she unconsciously ignored some unreasonable details.

The moon was high in the sky.

The girl in the black cloak slowly put down her hood, revealing a face that was almost identical to Xia Ge's. The moonlight shone on her face, outlining her smile, which was somewhat cold.

"It's time to begin."
The young girl smiled lightly and picked up a bone flute, playing an ancient tune.

"Who?!" A sudden voice of a young man broke the silence of the alley.

Ye Ze drew his sword, standing in the alley in the middle of the night, dressed in night clothes. He looked like trouble!

Maybe he was a member of the demonic cult!

The girl let out an "oh" as her melody was interrupted. She was surprised at first, but when she saw the sword on the newcomer's back, her smile deepened.

With a light flick of her hand, the white bone flute turned into a pure white jade flute, with a trace of red blood running through it. It was the Eight Wasteland Flute!

Ye Ze held his sword and asked, "Who are you--"

The girl's flute was interrupted by him at first, but now she continued to play as if nothing had happened. Ye Ze was ignored by her. Just as he was about to say something, the moonlight was gentle and the girl turned her head slightly to look at him.

In an instant, Ye Ze was speechless.

He couldn't say anything.

The girl's skin was as white as snow, and her cat-like eyes were reflecting the moonlight. The pure white jade flute in her hand, with a trace of blood, made her lips look red, like a fairy traveling at night.

Ye Ze's hand holding the sword trembled slightly. His hand slipped and the sword fell to the ground with a loud clang. His mind was in chaos, and in the end, his mind was blank, with nothing in it.

Three years had passed.

Su Chan was a little surprised, but she had achieved her goal, so she didn't care. She laughed lightly, and her figure disappeared.

Ye Ze didn't move, not even a little bit.

But not long after the girl finished playing her flute.

"Boom--"

The earth shook and the sky cracked. The land within thousands of miles began to shake violently. The bright moon was covered by endless lead-colored clouds, and shocking lightning flashed. Countless sharp-winged beasts roared and then began to attack the creatures outside the Evil Spirit Mountain like they were controlled by something!

It was as if they were being controlled by something!

People from the restaurant ran out frantically as the dilapidated buildings collapsed. "The Evil Spirit Mountain is shaking!!"
"What happened?!"

"..."

However, the beasts did not give them much time to think. With lightning speed and sharp claws, they swept through, leaving behind crimson blood and gruesome heads.

"Ah-!"

Few people had time to see how their companions were doing. They frantically pulled out defensive treasures, some flew into the sky, some burrowed underground, some used defensive formations, each using their own methods.

"Roar-!"

Red flames spewed from the beasts' mouths!

"Ah, my clothes!"

Someone who thought their clothes could withstand the beasts' attacks flew into the sky and let out a miserable scream! When people looked up, they saw a man engulfed in flames. Someone tried to help by throwing a water ball, but when it landed, the man's flames only grew stronger, unlike ordinary fire.

Gu Peijiu's eyes turned cold. She wrapped the man in the Tianzhu Ling and moved her spiritual power, covering the Tianzhu Ling with a layer of icy frost. The man struggled desperately, but the flames on his body slowly went out under the protection of the Tianzhu Ling. He convulsed once and then stopped moving.

Gu Peijiu paused and retrieved the Tianzhu Ling, but the man was already dead.

The beasts in the sky roared, and more and more people suffered the same fate as the man. In an instant, everyone's minds were focused on how to survive, rather than ancient clothes that could protect them.

Gu Peijiu waved the Tianzhu Ling, and the red silk shimmered with icy electric light as it flew into the sky, intertwining and covering the sky in the blink of an eye like an indestructible barrier, blocking all the beasts outside the Ling Luo.

"Roar-!"

... They were temporarily safe.

There were also many beasts attacking from below, but fortunately, there were few of them, and they were quickly dealt with.

Gu Peijiu frowned. These beasts had come too suddenly.

They had not come for several days, and then suddenly... 

"These strange things have always been inside the Evil Spirit Mountain, why did they suddenly attack?"

"It's too strange, too strange..."
"Who is this..."

"He is the senior disciple of Danfeng from Lingxi Peak..."

"Oh, I see."

"..."

The violent trembling of the Evil Spirit Mountain seemed to have disappeared.

Gu Peijiu held the corner of the Tianzhu Ling and squinted her eyes slightly.

Something was not right.

The earth was shaking slightly.

Before people could recover from the shock of the bird and beast that ate humans, they heard someone's fearful voice-

"Look...what is that?"

Everyone's eyes turned towards the Evil Spirit Mountain!

They saw a faintly rolling dust rising from the high mountains.

From a distance, the dust looked like a floating mist, but as it rolled closer and closer, it became larger and larger. It was accompanied by the furious howling of beasts, more terrifying than any ordinary wild animal-

"A herd of beasts!"

"Why are there herds of beasts!"

"These are not ordinary wild beasts...they are strange beasts! They live in the Evil Spirit Mountain and accompany the evil spirits for a hundred years without dying! They eat human flesh!"

"..."

Ye Ze picked up his sword and hurried back to Gu Peijiu's side. When he saw the herd of beasts, his pupils slightly contracted.

Someone next to him anxiously said, "Why are there herds of beasts! We have always been peaceful, and we haven't gone up the mountain-"

"Could someone have disturbed them?"

"Who would disturb them!"
"I heard...the people of the demonic cult have a secret method to control wild beasts..."

"..."

In an instant, Ye Ze's mind flashed with the delicate face of Xia Wuyin, the white jade flute tinged with blood, and the ghostly smile when she left.

Gu Peijiu noticed his strange expression and asked, "What's wrong?"

Ye Ze smiled lightly, his voice calm as if nothing had happened. "It's nothing."

But his fist under his sleeve clenched tightly.

A faint voice of Chu Yiyi's sweet yet cold voice flashed through his mind.

"I just envy you for being able to let go so easily."

Anyone can pick it up, but who can let go?

...definitely not him.

Ye Ze silently told himself that it wasn't him.

That person who played the flute, it wasn't him.

He just didn't see anything just now.
