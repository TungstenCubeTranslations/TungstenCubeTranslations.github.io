"...You said you're from Mo Village? What's your name?" Xia Ge's scythe was shaking slightly, the blade trembling. "Who do you know?"

The beauty looked at her, her eyes shimmering with tears, her tone extremely aggrieved. "My name is Achan, a woman waiting to be married from Mo Village. My hometown is in Peach Blossom Valley. My parents became outer disciples of Lingxi Mountain Gate and settled in Mo Village..."

"Who do you know?"

"I've been brought up in seclusion since childhood, never leaving the house." Seeing Xia Ge's skeptical expression, Achan hesitated for a moment. "If I know anyone... it would be Miss Mo Qiuran from the wine house."

...Mo Qiuran?

Xia Ge was slightly surprised.

"I'm really not a ghost... Young Master, I've been staying here for two days and haven't had a drop of water." Achan's eyes were full of tears again, sobbing. "I'm afraid I'll never see Young Master Ji again... If the Young Master can get out, please pass a message to Young Master Ji. Tell him that even if Achan turns into a ghost, she will remember him, sob sob sob..."

Who is Young Master Ji? The groom?

Xia Ge was blunt. "If you turn into a ghost... I don't think he'll be very keen on being remembered by you."

Achan immediately burst into tears, looking even more sad.

System: "Can't you speak more gently?"

Xia Ge: "..."

"Sob sob sob..."

The beautiful woman in red covered her mouth and cried, looking heartbroken. Xia Ge saw that her face was pale, and her lips were slightly cracked, probably because she hadn't had any water. After hesitating for a moment, she whispered to the system, "Then I'll be gentler... Ghosts don't have dry lips, do they?"

Achan: "..."

System: "...No." She seemed to hear it.

Achan forced a smile, her face pale, her eyes with tears. "Young Master is really good at joking..."

"I'm not joking... Anyway, as long as you're not a ghost." Xia Ge put the scythe on her back, and her wide sleeves covered her hands, making it look like she was taking something out of her sleeve. Her fingers touched the tail ring, and she took out the fasting pill.

The golden fasting pill.

Xia Ge didn't approach her, but threw the fasting pill to her from a distance. "This is a fasting pill. You won't feel hungry after eating it."
The golden pill drew a beautiful arc in the air, and Achán reached out to catch it. With a graceful movement of her red sleeve, her slender jade fingers, stained with vermilion rouge, picked up the pill as elegantly as a swan.

Xia Ge's eyes flickered, but then she acted as if nothing had happened.

Achán held the pill and looked hesitant. "Young Master, you gave me this divine elixir. What about yourself?"

"... "

This thing that can keep you from being hungry for a year is really terrifying.

Xia Ge put on a fake smile. "I'm not hungry. Please, go ahead and eat it, Miss."

"Then... thank you for your kindness, Young Master." Achán smiled apologetically and put the pill in her mouth. Her little tongue stretched out, and she looked like a bewitching beauty.

Even Xia Ge, a woman herself, felt that she was staring too much.

What a lucky man to marry such a beautiful woman.

However, before Xia Ge could finish her thoughts, the stone room suddenly shook violently! The night pearl in the small stone room suddenly shone brightly, and countless black vines instantly spread out from the walls, attacking Xia Ge! Xia Ge was shaken by the sudden shock, but she quickly regained her senses. Her eyes sharpened, and she swung her sickle, mercilessly cutting off the vines that came at her! Suddenly, a scream was heard, and Xia Ge cut off a sharp wooden spike that had suddenly pierced through. She looked up and her pupils shrank slightly. She saw that the densely packed vines with thorns had already bound Achán, who was defenseless, and lifted her high up on the wall! The golden pill accidentally fell to the ground, and Achán widened her eyes. "Young Master, the pill... ah..."

The thorny vines deeply pierced the beauty's white and tender skin, and the bright red blood overflowed, dyeing her already bright wedding dress an even deeper color!

The air was filled with a strong bloody smell. Xia Ge's pupils suddenly shrank!

No matter who she is--

As long as she bleeds, she is a human being!!

"Hey!"

Xia Ge's heart tightened. The black thorny vines grew like crazy from the walls and floor, and the strong smell of blood spread. Xia Ge gritted her teeth. "You... hold on for a while!"

"Young Master... don't worry about me."

Achán, with her blood-stained dress, spoke weakly. A few drops of blood spilled from her lips, and her slender butterfly-like eyelashes trembled slightly. "...If Young Master can get out... please give a message to Young Master Ji... Achán... likes him very much... likes him so much that even if she becomes a ghost, she doesn't want to leave him... likes him..."

The black vines continued to spread and contract.

"Not being able to marry him in this life... is Achán's lifelong regret..."

"If I can't marry him in this life... then in the next life..."


"I don't believe in the afterlife! If I like someone, I'll marry them in this life!" Xia Ge fiercely cut through the nearby vines, her sickle blade dancing, her ghostly shadows moving, and the thick thorns shattered like paper under the sharp blade. Her unbound black hair fluttered in the wind.

"People die like the extinguishing of a lamp, and even if there is an afterlife, you won't remember him! This kind of cheesy talk...you should tell him yourself!!!" 

The happiness of the present cannot be held, so what's the use of relying on the vague afterlife? Who knows what you'll become in the next life or what you'll like. In this life, you may like one thing, but in the next life, you may like another. Even if it is the same soul, once it experiences different things, its thoughts will change, and its love and hate will naturally be different.

So when Xia Ge hears someone talking about how they won't meet again in this life or the next, she finds it a bit ridiculous.

She has never believed in past lives or this life.

The afterlife is just the lost path of this life.

A-chan slightly widened her eyes, looking at the young man who was holding a black scythe, his black hair fluttering, cutting through thorns and vines. The overlapping illusions flashed by, and the last thing she saw was the lazily spoken words of the woman in the green dress with a bone flute at her waist.

"Aren't past lives and the afterlife just the lost paths of this life? Instead of relying on these vague things, it's better to live well in the present. After all, having wine and meat now is the right way."

Xia Ge stuck to the wall, cutting off the vines that grew from it. In the countless overlapping fragments of branches and leaves, she found the golden pill that had accidentally fallen to the ground at a glance. With a sweep of her sickle, a flash of her figure, she had already taken the golden pill from the ground.

"Swish, swish, swish -"

The sharp sickle wind flew by, and the entangled vines on her body broke into several pieces in the blink of an eye. Without the support of the puppet, A-chan fell from the stone wall like a red butterfly with broken wings, leaving a thick trail of blood on the wall as she fell.

"Clang!"

The black sickle blade was deeply embedded in the stone wall next to her ear, and the sharp wind lifted the black hair at the side of A-chan's face. She stared blankly at the red-clothed young man who hooked his sickle with one hand and lifted her shoulder with the other. The heavy vines fell to the ground and turned into ashes. Xia Ge pulled A-chan up and carried her on her back.

"Hold on to me!"

A-chan's fair hand instinctively gripped the young man's thin shoulder. Although his night clothes were black, the soft fabric felt warm in her hand.

This is...the feeling of being protected.

It's been a long time since she felt it.

A-chan lost her mind.
The light of the night pearls became brighter and more dazzling, almost piercing through the thick vines that fell down and penetrating into the eyes. As a result, the vines that Summer Song had directly cut off from the stone wall started to grow wildly again!

There's a problem with those night pearls!!

Summer Song exerted force, pulled out her sickle, kicked the wall, and used the Ghost Shadow technique to land on the ground. Then, she flashed with Achan to the opposite stone passage and settled her down. "Give me your hand."

Achan looked at her, as if she didn't quite understand what she meant, but still obediently reached out her hand.

Her fair and jade-like hand seemed to be the most exquisite masterpiece made by the most skilled sculptor in the world.

However, Summer Song didn't look at it for long. She quickly put the golden pill in her hand and let her grip it tightly. "Eat it quickly, don't drop it again."

Achan held the golden pill, and the sweet fragrance of the medicine diffused slightly.

"You wait here."

After saying that, she wanted to rush out with her sickle, but her hand was suddenly pulled.

The touch was icy cold.

Summer Song shook her hand subconsciously, and when she reacted, she felt embarrassed. "No, sorry..."

Achan's eyes flashed with a hint of shallow light, and then she shook her head, her voice low, "I was presumptuous. Thank you for saving my life just now, sir."

"No, no, just stay here."

"Sir, are you not afraid that I am a bad person since you saved me so recklessly?" Achan sat on the ground, her back straight, her posture still elegant, her red dress spread out on the ground. Although her face was pale, her eyes still flickered with charm.

Summer Song looked at the vines that were growing wildly towards the two of them, feeling anxious. She flashed up and the sickle shadow flew...

Just when Achan thought that the other party wouldn't answer.

"Crack--"

The dazzling white light of the night pearl disappeared with a crisp cracking sound, and the shadow of the boy in the shattered light was unpredictable. While sweeping through the thorns and brambles, the fierce sickle wind unhesitatingly swept all the night pearls on the wall into pieces--

"You have to be a living person first." The vines turned into ashes and dissipated in the moment when the light of the night pearl disappeared. The boy with the sickle stood firmly on the ground, his black hair slightly raised, his voice slightly hoarse, "Then I can know if you are a bad person."

Achan fell silent.

The light of the night pearl in the stone room was shattered all over the ground, and the fine light stains spread over the darkness. The night pearls in the stone passage were still shining with a faint light, and the beautiful woman in red clothes looked like a fairy in the painting.
Xia Ge walked up to her with a sickle in one hand and reached out to her, "Here, can you get up?"

A Chan looked at the hand reaching out to her.

She was thin and small, but under the reflection of the night pearl, she was as white as a warm jade, with an indescribable gentleness.

- You have to be alive first before I can know if you're a bad person.

This child gave the possibility of infinite regret in the future, but would not give the opportunity for regret in the present.

"Save me, young master will regret it."

A Chan did not respond, just chuckled softly and paused, "I will only hold back the young master."

Xia Ge was a little annoyed, "You're so troublesome. I saved you already, whether I regret it or not is my business, why do you worry?"

A Chan smiled slightly, as charming as a red lotus, "Then the young master is truly a kind person."

Xia Ge nodded, "You're right, that's what I think too."

System: "..."

A Chan then reached out and placed her hand in Xia Ge's hand, with fingers as red as rouge, making her hand look even whiter and tenderer like a dream under the reflection of the night pearl.

She gently squeezed it, wrapping Xia Ge's hand.

Being held by the slightly cold hand, Xia Ge was stunned, feeling as if she had been touched by the coolness of a midsummer night, making her feel comfortable and not cold.

"The young master's hand is really small." The beauty spoke with a gentle tone, her eyes and voice full of softness, "And warm too."

Xia Ge helped her up and supported her body, "Hmm, warm? Maybe it's sweat from my hand... don't talk anymore... let's move forward."

System: "..." What's with the sweat thing?! How can you talk to a beauty like that?!

The beauty paused for a moment, then continued as if nothing had happened.

"Young master has great strength."

Xia Ge: "Hmm, born with divine power, can't help it."

Born with divine power?
In the dim light of Achan's eyes, a glimmer flashed. "Speaking of which... I don't even know the name of the benefactor."

"Oh, me?" Xia Ge supported her and walked forward. "Don't be polite, don't offer yourself, your young master Ji is still waiting for you... My name is Lei Feng."

The system: "..."

Perhaps hearing the three words "Young Master Ji," the voice of the beauty behind him sounded a bit desolate. "Thank you, Lei Gongzi... I just don't know if I can make it out alive."

"Of course you'll make it out alive." Xia Ge's voice was casual. "If you can't get out, just dig a hole in the ceiling. If you dig all the way through, you'll get out."

Achan: "...Really?"

Xia Ge tried to comfort her. "Don't worry, you just ate my fasting pill, right? You won't be hungry for a year. If I accidentally die, you can take my sickle and slowly dig. Remember, one direction, knock for a year, you'll definitely get out."

Achan glanced at the golden pill in her hand and silently put it in her sleeve.

The system decided to tell the truth: "Host, I don't think she's being comforted."

Xia Ge: "...You talk too much."
