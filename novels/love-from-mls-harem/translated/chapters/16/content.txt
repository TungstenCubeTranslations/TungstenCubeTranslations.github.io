【Ding! Material inspection in progress! Inspection complete! Five materials are correct, puppet synthesis technique in progress】

【Synthesis successful!】

【Congratulations to the host for obtaining a new skill, Puppet Synthesis!】

Xia Ge tilted her head, and a flash of green light passed through her deep purple eyes. A panel appeared in front of her, with the introduction of the newly obtained skill written on it.

【Puppet Synthesis · Basic Synthesis】

【Usage: Gather materials and silently recite the skill name】

【Proficiency: 0/1】

Xia Ge: "…"

So sometimes, one has to admit that with a system, even a lazy person's life can be as convenient as using cheats.

She gathered all the materials together and silently recited "Puppet Synthesis" in her mind.

The materials in front of her began to change visibly to the naked eye!

A crystal-clear light slowly emerged from the air after she silently recited, wrapping the materials into a ball and floating it into the air bit by bit.

【Ding! Proficiency of Puppet Synthesis · Basic Synthesis 1/1】

【Ding! Congratulations to the host for refining an F-grade glass puppet!】

As the announcement of the refinement of the F-grade glass puppet was made, the ball of light wrapped around the materials exploded in mid-air, and a small puppet the size of a palm, transparent all over, fell "pat" onto the table.

Xia Ge's eyes lit up, but before she could rejoice, she heard a frantic knocking on the door!

Outside the door, Ye Ze's voice was extremely anxious, "Xia Wuyin!"

Xia Ge's pupils suddenly contracted, and she casually swept the small puppet on the table into her sleeve. "Ye Ze?"

【Ding! F-grade puppet refined... Congratulations to the host for advancing!】

【Puppet Apprentice → Puppet Master】

【Obtained title: Marionette Master】
"I heard that the mountain below was attacked by enchanted puppets. Are you okay? Open the door!" Ye Ze's voice was anxious. "Why are you still living here? Are those sickles on the roof from those puppets? Aren't you afraid it will collapse in the middle of the night?"

"It's fine, it won't collapse." Xia Ge's voice was casual. "I'm okay, the people from Jianfeng arrived quickly, don't worry. Why did you come down the mountain so late at night?"

"I just finished my evening class." Ye Ze's voice slowed down slightly when he heard that Xia Ge was okay. "It's not even that late at night... Xia Wuyin, open the door. Don't stay in this room tonight."

Xia Ge glanced to the side and saw a bronze mirror placed next to the window. Under the dim candlelight, his green hair was lazily tied up with a hairband, his black hair slightly messy. On his delicate cheeks were a pair of dark purple eyes that seemed enchanting.

[Enthrallment] status maintained.

Today, she couldn't see anyone.

"I'm not opening it." Xia Ge's voice was lazy. He lightly poked several holes in the window with his fingers, letting the bright moonlight in. Then he walked to the bed and casually took out a dagger from under the pillow. "This sickle is valuable, I have to watch over it today. If it's gone tomorrow when I wake up, it wouldn't be good."

Ye Ze: "..."

Ye Ze held back his anger. "You can stay in my room tonight, I'll go back up the mountain."

"No, no one will be watching it if I fall asleep." Xia Ge smirked, teasing him. "When the people from the mountain come, I'll say I've been in the room the whole time. Then this sickle will fall from the sky, and they'll have to pay me a huge compensation for the mental damage."

Ye Ze's face turned black. "If this room collapses today, the mountain will have to pay for your funeral."

Xia Ge tore a piece of cloth from the bed sheet with the dagger in his hand and covered his eyes with it. He said nonchalantly, "Ah, Ye Xiong is right. Ye Xiong is really smart. When it happens, the funeral expenses can be paid to Ye Xiong. Thank you for your five years of guidance."

Ye Ze: "..."

He really didn't want to accept this guy's funeral expenses!!

Blinded, it was pitch black. Xia Ge heard his own voice, "You should go back up the mountain quickly. Going up and down the mountain every day is tiring. Your brother almost lost half his hair when the puppets attacked earlier. Don't worry."

Moonlight was like water.

Ye Ze pursed his lips and leaned against the slightly old wooden door, looking up at the bright moon in the sky, speechless for a while.

Xia Ge was wondering why the other side suddenly went silent when he heard the boy's voice again outside the door, "I heard... today, there was a disciple with a green hairband who didn't know which sect of Lingxi Mountain he belonged to. He recklessly tried to save someone and almost died under the sickle of the enchanted puppet."

Xia Ge raised an eyebrow. Oh, the news spreads fast.

"Xia Wuyin, I know it's you." Ye Ze's voice was calm. "I knew it was you as soon as I heard it."
Xia Ge pretended to be shocked and said, "Senior Ye, I never thought that in your eyes, I would be such a brave and righteous person!"

...Except for you, no one on Lingxi Peak has dyed their hair green!

Ye Ze's veins throbbed, but he held back and said, "Do you know what annoys me the most about you?"

Xia Ge's voice sounded even more incredulous, "Senior Ye, do you dislike me?"

Ye Ze kicked open the door and said, "Xia Wuyin, can you stop being so arrogant?!"

The long-unmaintained door was mercilessly kicked open. Whether it was because of anger or because he had rushed down the mountain too quickly without even changing out of his Danfeng robe, the young man's breath was slightly uneven and his face was slightly red.

Xia Ge clenched the puppet in her hand, and cold sweat seeped from her palms under her wide-sleeved robe.
