Xia Ge was awakened by the chirping of sparrows.

She didn't open her eyes, but she was definitely awake.

...This doesn't seem like her bed.

The bedding was very soft, with a faint sandalwood scent, softer and warmer than the bedding she had sun-dried hundreds of times.

Xia Ge closed her eyes, feeling a little confused. How long had she been sleeping? When did she fall asleep? Had the soul-capturing effect worn off?

- She had no idea.

Unexpectedly, she didn't feel very panicked.

The comforting aroma lingered around her, and after a moment of confusion, Xia Ge began to recall what had happened.

Skipping class to drink, getting caught by her senior sister, encountering the siege of the demonic cult when she went out, her senior sister's Heaven Punishing Silk...

- "You can close your eyes until dawn, and the evil spirits won't harm you."

The girl's voice was cold, but it sounded particularly gentle.

"Xiao Kui, Xiao Kui." Xia Ge silently called out in her heart.

After a long time, she finally heard the lazy voice of the system. "What's up?"

"Has the effect worn off?" Xia Ge asked.

The system sounded very surprised. "What effect?"

"Soul-capturing," Xia Ge said.

"Mental capture has been upgraded. If you don't deliberately maintain it, the effect can disappear in three minutes," the system said.

"...," Xia Ge was speechless.

For a moment, Xia Ge felt an unforgettable shame about her pretentiousness in front of her senior sister yesterday.

Still not opening her eyes, Xia Ge slapped her forehead with the back of her hand. "Oh my god..."

Before, she couldn't open her eyes because of the soul-capturing effect, and now she couldn't face people.
Suffocating.

System: "Serves you right, who told you not to read the skill introduction."

Xia Ge: "I don't want to read it. If I read it, I might not be able to resist using it, and using it might expose me."

The system was momentarily stumped. "That sounds like a reasonable explanation."

Xia Ge turned over and silently thought to herself, of course it sounds reasonable. When a lazy person wants to take shortcuts, anything they say sounds reasonable.

After lying motionless on the bed for a while without anyone coming in, Xia Ge felt bored. She opened her eyes and suddenly realized that the bandage on her left hand had been replaced. She also felt her neck and found that a soft and clean bandage had been wrapped around it, emitting a faint sandalwood scent.

Xia Ge looked around the room.

Warm sunlight shone through the carved window frames, and the clean and tidy room had a pear wood table placed in front of the window. On the table was a small porcelain vase with a delicate peach blossom branch inserted inside.

Obviously, this was not her room.

The blanket on her was very soft, Xia Ge lifted it and looked at her clothes, then breathed a sigh of relief.

Her clothes had not been taken off.

System: "Even if they were taken off, there wouldn't be anything to see..."

Xia Ge: "..."

It's uncomfortable when you don't say anything.

Xia Ge got up expressionlessly, ran her fingers through her hair, and suddenly realized that her hair was loose, and her green hairband was nowhere to be found.

The system suddenly remembered something. "Host, you let those two demonic cult members go yesterday."

"Where's my hairband?" Xia Ge ignored the system and said, "Why can't I find it?"

"You gave the glass puppet to that person named Bai Ren... What do you want to do?"

Putting on her boots, Xia Ge turned the room upside down but couldn't find her hairband. "Where did it go?"

"Host, I must warn you not to try to change the course of the plot..."

"You're so annoying."
Xia Ge finally found her hairband on the pear wood table. The hairband, which had a corner cut by a paper blade, was pressed by a paperweight next to the rice paper. The breeze blew at noon, and the touch of emerald green made people feel particularly good.

"I won't change the plot," Xia Ge picked up the hairband and lazily tied it to her head, "the plot can be whatever it wants."

"But you..." 

"I heard that the demonic sect is very beautiful. Can't I let my little Luli experience it?" 

System: "..." 

You are really something.

The atmosphere became slightly solemn.

The system felt that it was a bit too harsh just now. In order to maintain a friendly cooperative relationship with the host, it decided to open up some permissions. "Oh, by the way, host, the points mall has added a lot of very affordable and interesting items. You can take a look when you have time..."

The system's reminder sounded rare and gentle.

"I don't want to see it," Xia Ge said.

Anyway, she just wanted to cheat her points. She was in a bad mood and didn't want to be cheated.

Getting something cheap and then acting cute?

System: "If you don't want to see it, then don't. Hmph."

When April's fragrant flowers have all fallen, the peach blossoms in the mountain temple begin to bloom.

The sun was just right. Xia Ge glanced at the peach branches blooming outside the window, and a faint light flickered in her eyes.

The plot is dead, but people are alive.

...Ye Ze.

Just as Xia Ge was lost in thought, the sound of the bamboo door being pushed quietly rang out. A girl's voice was faint, "Are you awake?"

Xia Ge turned around and saw Gu Peiju at the door.

Many mixed thoughts flew through her mind for a moment, and finally stopped at the sandalwood scent mixed with the aroma of peach blossoms.

"...Hello, senior sister."
Xia Ge heard her own obedient voice. This was the trick that defeated over a thousand puppets! "Pack up and leave, let's go to Su Xi, I'll teach you alchemy," said Gu Peijiu, glancing at Xia Ge's left hand and the snow-white bandage on her neck. Xia Ge: "..." Gu Peijiu left the room and didn't see the boy following her. She raised her eyebrows slightly and said, "Hmm?" A slightly painful voice came from the room. "Senior sister, I seem to have a disease that prevents me from practicing alchemy..." Gu Peijiu: "..." "Do you play the pipa? Do you play the sheng? Do you play any musical instruments? Or, can you teach me calligraphy and painting?" Gu Peijiu's voice was cold. "Our Danfeng entrance exam only tests alchemy, Xia Wuyin, don't forget what you said." Xia Ge: "..." The system that decided to have a cold war with the host sneered, "What are you struggling for? Go." It was really hopeless. Xia Ge followed Gu Peijiu to Danfeng Su Xi, but the boy was restless on the way. "Hey, senior sister, look at the purple butterfly here-" "Wow, the pattern is so beautiful!" "Senior sister, there are mulberries here!" "..." Gu Peijiu walked forward expressionlessly, turned a corner, and suddenly felt that it was too quiet behind her. She turned around, and the boy with the green hairband was nowhere to be seen.
Gu Peijiu paused and turned back, taking the bend in the road. The mountain path was rugged, with trees and bushes covering the area, lush and green, but there was no trace of the young man.

"Xia Wuyin."

Gu Peijiu frowned, and in the next moment, she tilted her head slightly, reaching out and grabbing three or four small things that had attacked her from the darkness.

A purple butterfly flew gracefully in front of her, its wings intricately patterned and beautiful, like a fairy from a painting. The clear laughter of the young man came from above, "Senior Sister, isn't the butterfly beautiful?"

Gu Peijiu looked up and saw the young man sitting on a thick branch, holding a green hawthorn in his hand and a dogtail grass in his mouth. His face was as bright and sunny as the April sunshine.

"Come down."

Gu Peijiu's heart moved slightly, but her face showed no expression. "Let's go."

"Really cold."

Spitting out the dogtail grass, Xia Ge nimbly jumped down from the tree, following behind Gu Peijiu with a smiling face. "Senior Sister, alchemy is not fun. How did you set up that formation yesterday? I want to learn, can you teach me?"

"I'll teach you when you get in."

The girl walked in front, her wide sleeves embroidered with delicate red maples covering her hands, her voice faint.

"But I really don't want to learn the Fasting Pill..." Xia Ge's voice sounded very aggrieved. "It must be very difficult! I saw Ye Zeqing bankrupt his family just to pass the exam!"

"It's not difficult."

Gu Peijiu's voice paused. "...but I'll give you the materials."

Xia Ge's heart immediately started calculating, thinking about how much he could sell the materials for the Fasting Pill.

"There's half a month left before the seventh exam. You must learn it in this half month." Gu Peijiu walked in front, not looking at Xia Ge's expression, but vaguely understood what this money-grubbing little rascal was calculating in his heart. "One material per day, I'll watch you refine it."

Xia Ge: "..."

...Ah, it's really heartbreaking.
She seemed to have lost a huge sum of money again.

The system: "......"

The young man behind her seemed very discouraged and didn't say anything for a while.

Gu Peijiu walked in front, lifting the wide sleeves embroidered with red maple leaves and casually glanced at the thing she had been holding in her hand.

Three or four bright red hawthorns were set against her slender white hand, shining brightly against the red maple leaves on her sleeves, making her look especially beautiful.

Gu Peijiu's eyes flickered slightly, and then she calmly put the hawthorn into her sleeve without changing her expression.

She really was a little slippery.

Suxi Dan Ge.

"Well, why is there carbon in the material when it's supposed to be three parts Liuli Wood......"

Xia Ge was squatting behind a furnace in the corner, looking at the alchemy book with a bitter expression. Gu Peijiu glanced at her, and Xia Ge immediately sat up straight, holding the book and speaking with a fluctuating voice, "Ah, senior sister, the book says I need three jin of silver wire carbon......"

Gu Peijiu: "......It's three qian."

Xia Ge quickly glanced at the book, "Ah, right, three qian, three qian."

Gu Peijiu's mood was slightly complicated. "Xia Wuyin, read the materials to me."

Xia Ge looked at the book with numerous rare characters, "......Huh?"

Gu Peijiu sat on the round cushion in the alchemy hall, her back straight, her posture elegant, her eyes calm and serene, "Read."

Xia Ge hesitated, "......This one......"

Xia Ge looked at the character 【啠木】 on the alchemy book and fell into contemplation for a moment.

How do you pronounce this...?

"......Senior sister, I think, some characters, we just need to know how to recognize them, why do we have to pronounce them out loud? These characters deliberately make themselves so obscure, they must not want people to know their names, so let's not force them......"

Under the gaze of the girl in red and white plain clothes who sat upright and expressionless, Xia Ge's voice became smaller and smaller, until it was almost inaudible.

Finally.
"Xiao Gui, how do you pronounce this character?" 

The system sneered, "Don't ask me, we've broken up." 

Xia Ge: "......" 

Did we break up? 

What kind of posture is breaking up... 

No, no, now is not the time to think about this. 

Under Gu Peijiu's gaze, Xia Ge felt uneasy all over, and finally slammed the book shut with a "snap" and threw it aside. For the first time, her indestructible thick skin felt a sense of burning, "I don't know this character!" 

...After sixteen years of compulsory education and four years of university in the motherland, it seems like she has learned nothing. 

Shame.jpg 

Gu Peijiu looked at her, his black eyes revealing no emotion, "You don't know it, why did you close the book?" 

Xia Ge replied very seriously, "When I close the book, it can't see me anymore." 

System: "......" 

"So if I don't know it, it doesn't know me either." 

Gu Peijiu: "......" 

System: "......Host, you should leave the group quickly. I don't think Lingxi Peak wants you anymore."
