System: "......"

Gu Peijiu: "......"

Gu Peijiu opened her eyes, the mist was hazy, and the slight blush on her face couldn't be seen clearly. "Heaven will punish them."

Tian Zhu Ling paused for a moment, then the red silk was soft again, and she carefully wrapped Xia Ge's chest.

Xia Ge: "......"

Just now, her mind went blank and she didn't react to anything on her body.

Suffocating.

...What are girls afraid of!

Being looked at is nothing! Anyway, she has also touched her back!

What is she thinking about?

Xia Ge felt a little hopeless.

"You're right, it is indeed a place of great beauty." Gu Peijiu glanced sideways, and Xia Ge could just see her pretty and long eyelashes from her angle.

Xia Ge thought blankly that her senior sister's eyelashes were really beautiful.

No, her senior sister is beautiful everywhere.

While she was lost in thought, she saw her senior sister lift her hand slightly, and on her fingertip was another beautiful silver butterfly.

"So, what is this exactly?"

Xia Ge: "......"

For a moment, Xia Ge felt like a mouthful of old blood was stuck in her chest, unable to go up or down.

It was like finally seeing the dawn of victory after making countless sacrifices, only to wake up and feel like it was all for nothing.

Xia Ge now understood this feeling very well.

"......"
Gu Peijiu paused for a moment and said, "You seem very nervous about this."

Xia Ge: "..."

She looked at her and asked, "Why?"

Xia Ge trembled as she pointed at the butterfly with her fingers, "It, it..."

Just as Gu Peijiu was about to say something, she suddenly heard a bustling noise and the voice of Bixi, "Miss, someone is here outside."

Gu Peijiu looked at Xia Ge, who had suddenly become stiff, and narrowed her eyes slightly, "Who is it?"

Bixi said, "It seems that something has happened in Jianfeng and they are looking for someone?"

Xia Ge shuddered and immediately forgot everything. She swam towards the other side in a doggy-paddle style and said, "Ah, ah, ah, senior sister, how could I take your hot spring, it's really inhumane of me, please let me go back!"

Gu Peijiu rolled her hand slightly and Tianzhu Ling stretched out to wrap Xia Ge tightly, then shrank and rolled Xia Ge to her side like a rolled egg.

"Why are you running?"

The mist was swirling and Gu Peijiu looked at her with an unfathomable expression in her pitch-black eyes, "Or do you think you can escape by running now?"

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge felt guilty, "I, I didn't run, I just felt that I am not suitable to be here..."

Love is really taking her to a deadly "good place".

She glanced at Tianzhu Ling in despair.

Can't they just be a little more sensible?!

The system thought for a moment, "The fastest way for Xia Ge to escape is to directly return to Tianzhu Ling's body."

Just as it was speaking, they heard Bixi's voice faintly coming from ahead, "My Miss is taking a bath, do you want to wait here for a while?"

"Sure."

A familiar girl's voice came over, faintly with a hint of laughter, "I just don't know where your special student from Danfeng has gone so late at night?"

Chuyi? Oh my god, she actually came in person?!
...... But thinking about it, it's true that Yin Die belongs to her, so it's only natural for her to come along.

"Special enrollment?" Bijie seemed to be startled, and was about to say something, but then heard Gu Peijiu's calm voice, "Bijie."

Bijie responded with an "ah", "Miss? Do you have any orders?"

Gu Peijiu paused for a moment, pondered for a while, and glanced at Xia Ge.

Xia Ge didn't dare to look at her, her eyes wandering around, pretending to be looking at the scenery.

Wow, this hot spring is really big.

Gu Peijiu closed her eyes, and with a slight movement of her finger, the tip of the silver butterfly trembled slightly, and in the blink of an eye, it disappeared without a trace.

"Bijie, bring my clothes over."

"Yes, Miss... you guys wait here for a moment." The latter sentence was obviously spoken to Chu Yi who had come to sneak in at night.

"Of course, we will wait." Chu Yi chuckled.

Bijie's footsteps approached, and without Gu Peijiu's instruction, Xia Ge quickly submerged herself in the water. Gu Peijiu paused for a moment, and the scarlet Tianzhu Ling floated on the water, completely concealing the girl's figure.

"Miss, the clothes are placed here." Bijie came over and placed the clothes, and saw the red silk floating in the hot spring, and was stunned for a moment. "Why did you put it in the water?"

Gu Peijiu: "......"

Gu Peijiu paused for a moment and said, "It also wants to soak."

Bijie: "......"

Xia Ge: "......"

The Tianzhu Ling moved slightly, and then, under the expressionless gaze of its owner's black eyes, it slowly twisted and made a very enjoyable appearance.

Bijie: "......Then the clothes will be placed here."

As the sound of footsteps slowly faded away, Xia Ge couldn't hold her breath any longer. She was about to stick her head out to take a breath, but unexpectedly, a hand suddenly pressed her down.

"Poof-"

"Ugh-".
But the bixi suddenly turned back, looking worried. "Miss, when you bring it up later, don't forget to twist it a bit."

Gu Peijiu remained calm. "Okay, I know."

Xia Ge, who had been pressed into the water, muttered, "Hmm..." She was about to drown!!

Bixi said, "I think I heard a strange sound just now..."

Gu Peijiu replied casually, "It's probably Tianzhuling stretching."

Tianzhuling responded by slapping the water with its tail, causing it to splash more than three feet high.

Bixi said, "It looks very happy."

Gu Peijiu said, "Yeah, it's always like that."

Xia Ge remained silent.

"Miss, you should get up quickly. I think those people outside are not friendly," said Bixi.

"Okay, I know. You can go out first," Gu Peijiu nodded.

Bixi left.

This time, Xia Ge remained calm. When there was no sound, she loosened the jade hand on her head and emerged from the water with a red face, panting softly.

Like a drowning kitten.

Gu Peijiu found it amusing and unconsciously smiled. "Are you scared?"

"What am I scared of... I didn't do anything wrong," Xia Ge regained her breath and replied confidently. "You lied just now, Senior Sister!"

The system: "..."

Gu Peijiu didn't say anything, or perhaps she couldn't be bothered to respond. Tianzhuling lifted its tail and suddenly covered Xia Ge's eyes with a red cloth.

Xia Ge exclaimed and quickly covered her mouth. She realized that her Senior Sister was probably getting dressed.

She could hear the sound of clothes rustling as the young girl dressed. It seemed that she wasn't lying after all.

After a while, Xia Ge heard Gu Peijiu say calmly, "I didn't lie."
Xia Ge: "...you just said Tianzhu Ling wants to soak in the hot springs!"

Gu Pei Jiu fastened her belt. "It came down on its own."

Xia Ge remembered when she fell down, Tianzhu Ling seemed to have already been in the hot springs.

Xia Ge: "..."

She couldn't believe it and asked the Red Ling entangling her, "You still like soaking in hot springs?!"

Unlike Xiao Xiangsi's enthusiasm, Tianzhu Ling was more like an old person who had lived for thousands of years, baptized by endless years, and carried an old-fashioned elegance in every move.

It didn't care about Xia Ge's disbelief and lazily soaked half of itself in the water, while the other half wrapped around Xia Ge, obediently following its master's command.

Gu Pei Jiu tidied up, her wet hair draped over her shoulders, and Tianzhu Ling, which had been covering Xia Ge's eyes, loosened. She spoke lightly, "Stay here."

After Xia Ge could see, her first reaction was to silently observe the Tianzhu Ling that had wrapped her into a red salted fish.

...It sounded like she could walk away.

Seeing Xia Ge's obedient appearance, Gu Pei Jiu comforted her, "Don't be afraid."

She paused, "I'll protect you."

Xia Ge: "..."

When you know what she's done, you probably won't say this kind of thing anymore.

The system spoke deeply, "Take care of yourself."

Xia Ge: "..."

Gu Pei Jiu, wearing wooden clogs, still had a bit of moisture in her hair. After comforting Xia Ge, she walked outside and saw the leader of the blue-clothed girl at a glance.

The girl's hair was soft, her eyes bright, her cheeks snow-white, and she wore a blue and white thin shirt. The silver butterflies on the cuffs shone in the moonlight, and her fingertips held a silver butterfly flapping its wings, exactly the same as the one she caught in the hot springs before.

With just one glance, Gu Pei Jiu vaguely understood what trouble the little rabbit in the hot springs had caused her again.

"What happened?"

Gu Pei Jiu looked at Chu Yi and the others with a calm expression, and Ye Ze, wearing the Sword Peak disciple's clothes, stood at the back, not knowing what he was thinking.
Gu Peijiu noticed the jade in Ye Ze's hand that seemed vaguely familiar with a slight frown.

"Jianfeng was attacked at night, and we suspect there is a spy in Lingxi Peak. So we brought disciples to inform you to check the situation of those who did not return at night," Gu Peijiu said.

Chu Yi paused for a moment and smiled nonchalantly, "When I passed by the room where your Danfeng recruited students just now, I took a look... I wonder where Xia Wuyin of your peak is now?"

Silver butterflies fluttered, Chu Yi's dark almond eyes looked at Gu Peijiu, with a hint of a smile on her lips, but her eyes were cold.

She should have felt the butterfly just now in the hot spring.

Gu Peijiu said lightly, "Xia Wuyin is here with me."

Upon hearing this, everyone was stunned. Bixi widened her eyes and looked incredulously at her miss.

How could Xia Wuyin be here?!

Chu Yi narrowed her eyes, "Oh?"

Silver Butterfly told her that the little red ribbon did float over here, and as for why she mentioned Xia Wuyin...

She happened to pass by and checked, just happened to find that the other party wasn't there, why not mention it.

But she didn't expect...

Tsk.

Gu Peijiu said lightly, "I will notify someone to check on the disciples below. Besides this, is there anything else?"

"Of course there is," Chu Yi smiled lightly, "Why not let him come out and let us take a look? After all, talk is cheap."

Gu Peijiu looked at Chu Yi.

Chu Yi's lips were stained with a smile, her eyes suddenly became cold and sharp, not giving an inch.

"Heh." After a moment, Gu Peijiu smiled slightly, her black eyes calm and directly ignored Chu Yi's question, "Bixi, see our guests out."

Chu Yi's smile deepened, her eyes suddenly became icy, "Oh? Since you don't want to invite someone out, is the top disciple of Danfeng trying to protect the spy?"

"Whether or not we are protecting anyone, let the top disciple of Jianfeng come and talk to me. And talk is cheap, so please be careful with your words, Miss Chu," Gu Peijiu said with a straight face.

Bixi saw the situation and immediately said, "Yes, let the top disciple of Jianfeng come and talk to us. You don't even have the Lingxi token, you're just a messenger. Why do you have the right to order our miss?"
Chuyi said, "Senior Chang has already issued the Lingxi decree."

Bixi said, "Who would believe you just talking nonsense in the middle of the night?"

Chuyi: "......"

The disciples: "......"

"Or, you can send your backup disciple, that's also fine," Gu Peiju said, casually raising her eyes, the polite smile on her lips turning cold, "You, are not quite qualified yet."

Chuyi seemed to have been poked in a sore spot, her pupils slightly contracted, and her fist under her sleeve suddenly clenched!

The atmosphere was tense for a moment.

After a while, a slightly hoarse voice of a young man came from behind Gu Peiju's door.

"Uh, um... are you looking for me?"

Gu Peiju: "......"

Ye Ze raised his head in surprise, "??? What the heck?!"

Bixi: "!!!??? Where did you come from?!"

Actually, it was like this.

Xia Ge was originally soaking in the hot spring pool, unaware of the situation outside. She was both anxious and helpless, tightly bound by Tianzhuling, and could only negotiate with it in a low voice, "Hey hey, Tianzhuling... no, big boss Tian, Tian Tian, Zhuzhu, loosen up a bit, it's not good to soak in the hot spring for too long..."

Tianzhuling lazily patted the water with its tail, completely ignoring which onion she was.

Xia Ge: "......"

She really missed Xiao Xiangsi.

But where there's a will, there's a way. She wasn't completely helpless.

Xia Ge twisted her body, like a fish turning over, and managed to flip herself out of the hot spring. She lay on the ground for a while, all wet, and said, "Just watch me, really, big boss... you can't just let me be naked like this, right? I need to put on clothes, you're the Clothing Spirit, right? Do you know how to dress?"

System: "......"
Tian Zhuling seemed to think for a moment, then slowly let go. The red silk, faintly tinged with golden light, wrapped around her about a meter away, ensuring that she could dress herself while also making sure she could be tied up like a dumpling before she could escape.

Xia Ge was overjoyed. "You really know how to do it!"

Tian Zhuling pretended to tie her up again, and Xia Ge quickly protested, "Just kidding, just kidding!"

Xia Ge immediately took out her own clothes, the Danfeng plain clothes, from her ring. She didn't even care that they were damp, and quickly put them on in a haphazard manner. She didn't even have time to tie her chest and was about to rush outside barefoot when Tian Zhuling suddenly appeared in front of her, fierce and unyielding.

Xia Ge braked to a stop and rubbed her hands nervously. "Hey, you see, you let me wear your clothes. It's not a big deal for me to go out and see guests now. You may not understand, but when a person puts on clothes, it means they're going to see people..."

Tian Zhuling had been tricked once, but this time she remained unmoved.

Xia Ge said, "..."

She took a step back. "Can I just listen outside?"

"Really, I'm a little dog if I'm lying to you!"

Tian Zhuling was too lazy to move.

Xia Ge felt that this might not be very convincing and added, "If you don't believe me, I... I... I'll be unlucky for a month, have food stuck in my teeth when I drink water, and stumble when I walk! I'll just listen outside and won't be discovered by anyone!"

The system said, "Add one more, like losing money every day."

Xia Ge said, "..." Go away.

Perhaps hearing Xia Ge's oath, Tian Zhuling thought for a moment, and the red silk ribbon paused for a moment before letting her go.

Xia Ge thought, "..." Are all clothing masters so easy to fool?

She ran into the house from the back door in three steps and crouched by the door to eavesdrop. Tian Zhuling followed her to prevent her from making any other moves.

When Xia Ge heard Gu Peiju say, "Xia Wuyin is with me," her heart suddenly felt cold.

...Even though Danfeng disciples say that without trust, they won't stand, but you can't be this trustworthy! Suffocating!

Her innocence was also very important!

The system said, "..." Why does it sound like Senior Sister is at a disadvantage?
As the conversation went on, Xia Ge felt that things were getting out of hand. She knew very well about Chu Yi's personality of not giving up until she reached her goal. If she failed here, she would definitely find a way to make up for it elsewhere.

Sometimes, Xia Ge admired Chu Yi's perseverance, but at other times, it gave her a headache.

The system lamented, "Do you want to be a dog? You will have bad luck for a long time, the kind where you lose money every day."

Xia Ge replied, "Shut up."

When Xia Ge stepped forward, she felt like she was under the moonlight, and her senior sister's expression looked particularly solemn.

As soon as she appeared, everyone's gaze was on her, one by one, their eyes subtly shifting.

Ye Ze's expression looked a bit stiff. He looked Xia Ge up and down two or three times before looking back at the jade in his hand, looking a bit confused.

Chu Yi's gaze was simple.

Although she hid it well, Xia Ge was still very sensitive to the coldness and killing intent in her eyes.

Xia Ge was slightly stunned, Chu Yi...?

"My first tenet as a disciple of Danfeng is 'trust.' Since you have seen it, you can go back," Gu Peijiu frowned slightly and stood in front of Xia Ge, blocking Chu Yi's somewhat fierce gaze.

"So this is the extraordinary special recruit of Danfeng, Xia Wuyin. It really is better to see once than to hear a hundred times," Chu Yi withdrew her gaze and chuckled.

Gu Peijiu's face had no expression, and Xia Ge was still thinking about the cold look Chu Yi had just given her. She didn't even hear what Chu Yi said.

...Why that look?

"Since that's the case, I won't disturb you any longer," Chu Yi slightly bowed, "I'll take my leave."

After speaking, she left with her people.

The people from Jianfeng left, and Bixi was still staring in disbelief at Xia Ge, who seemed to have magically appeared out of the house. After a while, she looked at Gu Peijiu, who was calm and composed, and for a moment, she felt like her brain wasn't functioning properly. She pointed at Xia Ge and stuttered, "Y-y-you...you..."

Gu Peijiu turned to Xia Ge and asked, "Why did you come out?"

Bixi: "...How does Miss know?!"

The damp Tianzhuling slowly crawled out of the house and silently hung herself on the paulownia tree outside.

Gu Peijiu said to Tianzhuling, "Come down."
Tian Zhu Ling still hung there motionless.

Xia Ge didn't turn back to Pei Jiu's words, she was still recalling the look Chu Yi gave her just now.

Clearly his lips were smiling like a gentle breeze, but his eyes were as cold as if they were poisoned.

Xia Ge slowly crouched down and murmured, "Did I do something wrong?"

Pei Jiu was slightly startled, looking at the girl crouching on the ground. Her black hair was wet and draped over her shoulders, making her look a bit lost.

"... Did I do something wrong?"

She seemed to be asking Pei Jiu, but also just talking to herself.

If she hadn't done anything wrong, why would that child look at her like that?

Pei Jiu paused for a moment, then walked up to the girl, looking down.

"You did nothing wrong."

Xia Ge looked up at her, her black eyes a bit confused.

Pei Jiu looked into her eyes and repeated softly, "You did nothing wrong."

... Nothing wrong.

If she did nothing wrong, why did Chu Yi look at her like that?

She thought it was good, that there was nothing wrong with it. She returned the Ghost Dragon Jade to its rightful owner, Chu Yi's eyes wouldn't deteriorate, Ye Ze's path would be smoother, and she could happily be her carefree Xia Wu Yin, occasionally practicing puppetry, searching for the tranquil soul, and dreaming of becoming a puppet master and suddenly returning home one day...

This way, it would be good for everyone.

This way, it was already right, wasn't it?

"You don't even know what I did, how do you know I did nothing wrong?" Xia Ge said, not willing to move, persistent. "And besides, just because I thought it was right, does that make it right?"

"Is it really like that?"
It was like hitting a dead end all of a sudden.

However, the rights and wrongs in this world cannot be encapsulated in a single statement.

Gu Peijiu remained silent for a while before saying, "Bixi, get a towel."

Bixi quickly fetched a towel and handed it to Gu Peijiu.

"Well, it's like this." Gu Peijiu reached out and gently touched Xia Ge's damp black hair, then placed the soft towel on her head. "If you think it's right, then let go and do it."

Xia Ge unconsciously touched the towel on her head and suddenly realized what she was saying. She looked embarrassed and said, "Ah..."

What was she saying to her senior sister?

What was right or wrong?

"Uh... Senior sister, that... I didn't mean to fall in, it was just now..."

"It's all the fault of lovesickness!" After struggling for a while, Xia Ge quickly shifted the blame. "It led me here! I don't know anything! I was just talking nonsense, don't take it seriously..."

Gu Peijiu's face remained expressionless.

Xia Ge suddenly couldn't figure out her senior sister's mood. "Um, although it was an accident, um, aren't you angry?"

"Why should I be angry?" Gu Peijiu asked.

Xia Ge: "..." Wasn't she angry about being groped?

Of course, even if Xia Ge had a hundred times the courage, she wouldn't dare to remind her senior sister of the incident.

"Haha, it's good that you're not angry, it's really good. Um, it's getting late, senior sister should rest early." Xia Ge forced a laugh. "I'll go back first..."

"Xia Wuyin," Gu Peijiu suddenly said.

"Present!" Xia Ge instinctively stood up straight.

Gu Peijiu spoke slowly, "Don't you plan to explain tonight's incident?"

As expected, she couldn't fool her way out of it.

Xia Ge looked worried, "Senior sister, do you want to hear the truth or a lie?"
Gu Peijiu: "I want to hear what you have to say."

Xia Ge: "..."

Gu Peijiu said, "As long as you speak, I will believe you."

Xia Ge suddenly felt that lying was a little too much for her conscience.

After a long time, she said, "The stars are really beautiful tonight." Xia Ge looked up at the sky. "They are so beautiful."

Pausing for a moment, Xia Ge spoke seriously, "I have spoken, senior sister."
