Chu Yao landed lightly in the air, her blue and white wide sleeves fluttering. She glanced at Gu Peiju, who had landed at the same time as her, and the unconscious young man in her arms. She snorted lightly and turned to leave.

In the air, there was a strong, bloody smell.

She didn't feel it when she kicked the furnace just now, but now the smell was getting stronger. Chu Yao frowned and saw the bloodstains on the ground with just one glance.

The ground of the Dan Xun platform was specially polished with water-milled bluestone, which was very smooth, so the bloodstains rubbed off by the clothes were clearly visible.

The Dan furnace she had just kicked was now outside the Dan training field and no one was hurt. The table where she had placed the medicinal materials and other miscellaneous items earlier was still in its original place, which was where Xia Wuyin had been just now.

And there was a small puddle of bright red blood near the foot of the table.

She paused and looked up to see the blood slowly dripping down onto the bluestone from the right corner of the table.

The bright red bloodstain was extremely eye-catching.

Her steps suddenly stopped, but she saw the back of the red and white maple clothed girl leaving with the small black-clothed young man in her arms.

As if afraid of startling the young man in her arms, she walked slowly and lightly, each step as elegant as the last.

"Hey." Chu Yao hooked her slender fingers around the sword tassel, the scabbard and sword tightly pressed together. She lifted her chin slightly towards the figure, "Stop, do you hear me?"

Gu Peiju stopped, and she turned her head slightly to look back. Her soft black hair, tied with a red hairband, scattered slightly with her movements, and her pitch-black eyes met Chu Yao's light brown ones.

Chu Yao revealed a crystal-clear fang at the corner of her lips and casually swung her sword, "So you're the eldest disciple of Dan Feng?"

Gu Peiju didn't turn around, just glanced at her lightly and nodded slightly.

"Don't let him die." Chu Yao licked her lips, her ambition and arrogance not concealed in her eyes, "That kid is the rising star of my Sword Peak."

Gu Peiju looked directly at Chu Yao's ambitious light brown eyes for a moment.

"Since he has chosen the path of Dan Feng," the red and white maple clothed girl turned her head, the breeze blowing her soft black hair, the red hairband fluttering, her black eyes indifferent, "I won't let him turn back."

"Tsk." Chu Yao held her sword and smiled, her brown eyes shining, her fang glaring, "Then let's wait and see."

Gu Peiju looked at her indifferently, then turned and left.

The reason she didn't turn around just now was because the blood of Xia Wuyin had already soaked through her clothes. Even though he was unconscious, he tightly clung to her clothes, shivering all over, his pale face filled with despair and fear.

She thought.
- Such a cowardly appearance.

This proud child wouldn't want to be seen like this by anyone, right?

Xiaoqing hurriedly rushed over from the stage and glanced at Gu Peijiu who had left, feeling indignant on behalf of Chu Yao. "What's her attitude! Even if... you are the eldest daughter of the Chu family!"

Chu Yao stopped smiling and silently looked at the bloodstains on the corner of the table for a while.

"Xiaoqing, be quiet and go back."

The Red Phoenix in the sky flapped its wings slightly, and the three spirit birds carried the three golden pills floating in the clouds, and under Bai Liqing's instructions, they flapped their wings and flew to the northern platform, placing the three pills on the small table.

The rich fragrance of the pills spread throughout the pill training field, and the disciples of Danfeng who were the judges for the competition were momentarily at a loss as to how to evaluate the results.

If the three life pills were perfectly completed, then Xia Wuyin would undoubtedly be the winner, but he exploded the furnace.

According to the evaluation criteria, once the furnace is exploded, it is considered a failure.

Just as he was in a dilemma, Gu Peijiu, holding the black-clothed boy, had already arrived on the platform. The faint smell of blood spread, and the girl easily wrapped the boy's pale face in the sleeves of Danfeng, and the disciple in charge of judging hurriedly went up, looking conflicted. "Senior Sister... how should we judge his results?"

The girl in the red and white maple dress said lightly, "Judge however you think is appropriate."

Before the disciple in charge of judging could speak, Ye Ze's anxious voice came from the side, "Senior Sister, what's wrong with Xia Wuyin?"

Xia Wuyin had successfully refined the three life pills, but Ye Ze didn't feel a bit happy. Looking at the boy who was dying in Gu Peijiu's arms, an inexplicable sense of guilt rose in his heart.

- It was because he was too useless.

If he could be a little stronger, he could protect him, and he wouldn't have to suffer so much.

Ye Ze clenched his fists.

In fact, he also understood that Xia Wuyin was so cunning and smart that even without his protection, he could still thrive in this small Danfeng.

- It's just that he couldn't rest assured.

So Xia Wuyin finally agreed to him.

- In order to let him leave with peace of mind and go to Jianfeng.

"Injured participation." Gu Peijiu paused, her long eyelashes like crow feathers. "I will take him to heal, and the rest, Lu Mi, leave it to you."
The judge who evaluates the results is Lu Mi. Although she finds it difficult to handle, she still nods, "Yes, senior sister."

Gu Peijiu turns around to leave, and Ye Ze wants to follow her. She glances at him with deep black eyes, "Ye Ze, it's time for you to prepare to go to Jianfeng since you've delayed until now."

Ye Ze looks at her, his Adam's apple rolling, but he doesn't move or speak.

After a pause, Gu Peijiu says calmly, "Leave it to me. I will take care of him. You can rest assured."

Ye Ze tightens his lips for a moment and then says, "Okay."

Outside the Dan training field.

After being dragged to the field, Mao Qing was stunned for a while and then said, "It's a Three-Life Golden Pill..."

Huo Bai frowns, "Three-Life Golden Pill?"

He looks like he doesn't know what it is.

Mao Qing says, "How come you don't even know this?"

Huo Bai doesn't care, "As long as I can get started."

"Three-Life Golden Pill is rare. It can refine three types of yellow-grade pills, which is really amazing."

Mao Qing stomps her feet, looking depressed, "Xia Wuyin must be the champion this time since he has refined the Three-Life Pill..."

Huo Bai says, "Oh."

Mao Qing says, "Don't be sad. Although I didn't win the championship and can't invite you to dinner, I can still invite you to eat a candy. You may not know, but the best candy in the area is not the mint-flavored one, but the cherry-flavored one from the Jinjiang Sugar Shop downstairs..."

Huo Bai's face turns red, and he becomes angry and embarrassed. He flicks his sleeves and walks away, "I don't eat candy!!"

"Hey, your candy fell!"

Huo Bai's steps become unsteady, and he instinctively looks down, but the bluestone floor is empty...

"You see, you still care." Mao Qing holds her shoulders and raises her eyebrows with a smile.

Huo Bai says, "..." Can he dismember this woman? 

...Endure.
Huobai walked away with a black face.

Mao Qing sneered, "Pah, hypocrite."

Looking at the golden pill in her hand, Mao Qing still felt somewhat unwilling. She raised her head and saw that Huobai and the other disciples who had finished refining the pills had already handed them over. She bit her lip and could only go over and put the pills in the numbered pill box and hand them in.

"Oh?"

The slender sunset was stretched by the smoke and clouds. The girl with beautiful silver butterflies embroidered on her blue sleeves sat on the roof, her slender and beautiful fingertips pinching a plump cherry, the rosy cherry contrasting with her white fingers like jade. "Are you saying... my dear elder sister wants an outer disciple of the Dan Peak to become a new talent of the Sword Peak?"

The sunset glow.

The voices below were somewhat nervous. "Replying to Second Miss... yes."

"Who can have such an honor?"

The girl's almond-shaped eyes curved, and her black pupils reflected the brilliant clouds on the horizon. Her smile was innocent and lively. "When I came, my sister didn't even take a second look."

The people below seemed a little nervous. "...It's a disciple named Xia Wuyin from the Dan Peak."

Chu Yi's smile suddenly froze on her lips.

After a while.

"You said, who?"

She stopped smiling, her voice still crisp, but with a faintly sinister tone. "Say it again for me."

The innocent and lively girl from a second ago suddenly turned into a demon from hell.

The person below became even more nervous. "Xia Wuyin, an outer disciple of the Dan Peak."

The red cherry, crushed by her force, splashed juice on the girl's slender white fingertips. The rosy and sweet smell spread, as eye-catching as blood.

- Xia Wuyin.

"It seems like everyone likes this person."

She casually threw away the crushed cherry in her hand and licked her fingertips. The pink little tongue was stained with the rosy juice of the cherry, and the sweet fragrance of the cherry spread on her tongue. However, she did not feel any pleasure. In her black almond-shaped eyes, there was a completely different sense of coldness and depression from Chu Yao. "You mean, as long as you mention this name, you can win everyone's favor?"
The people below didn't know what she was saying and could only bow their heads in silence.

"Ha." The young girl squinted her eyes and after a moment, smiled slightly. "But it doesn't matter."

She hadn't heard the name Xia Wuyin in many years.

Suddenly hearing it made her heart ache with hatred.

The person who made her happy was nowhere to be found, but the person she wanted to kill with no burial place was right in front of her.

"Killing him directly would be too simple." Chu Yi slowly pulled out a silver chain from her collar. On the chain, a small, broken jade dragon horn was carefully set in silver, stained with blood-red clouds that dyed the sky and also stained this small piece of dragon horn jade, accentuating the cold curve of her lips. "I will send him to the peak of glory and then let him fall to the mortal world, crushed by me into the mud with no chance of turning over."

The people below trembled slightly as they listened.

"That way, no one will like him anymore." The young girl seemed to have thought of something happy, her slender eyelashes trembling slightly as she gently kissed the dragon horn. "Brother Aze."

"But then you won't like him either."

The young girl looked at the dragon horn in her hand, her eyes slightly lost.

"But how can I find you..."
