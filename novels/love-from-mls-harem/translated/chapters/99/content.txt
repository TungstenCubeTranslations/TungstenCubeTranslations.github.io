"It's like talking flowers."

Xia Ge took the book off her face and as she looked up, she saw Mao Qing coming out of the hall.

"Oh, were you kicked out too?" Xia Ge chuckled.

"No." The girl in the Dan Feng plain clothes glanced at her. The morning sun was warm, but her gaze had an indescribable flavor. "The master asked me to go down the mountain to get something."

"Oh..." Mao Qing left, and Xia Ge looked at her book, then in the direction she had left.

System: "What's wrong?"

Xia Ge: "Nothing... I just feel like she's a bit strange today."

System: "There will always be those days."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge pursed her lips and was about to continue reading when she suddenly heard some commotion. She looked up and saw many disciples wearing Sword Peak clothes rushing towards the courtyard.

The leading disciple didn't see Xia Ge and shouted at the top of his lungs, "Surround the courtyard and catch Xia Wuyin!"

"Don't let that kid escape!"

"..."

Xia Ge: "...Huh?"

The master who was teaching inside felt that something was wrong and came out with a book in his hand, his voice hoarse. "What's going on? What's going on? What happened?"

Xia Ge hugged her book and hid behind a parasol tree, with a sense of foreboding.

"We suspect that he is a spy for the Demon Cult!"

The leading disciple's voice was loud and his gaze was like lightning. "Please hand over the person to us, and wait for punishment!"


Confucius narrowed his eyes and spoke slowly, "What did you say?"

The disciple raised his voice, "I said, your disciple Xia Wuyin from Danfeng is a spy of the demonic cult! Hand him over and await punishment!"

Confucius fell silent for a moment before suddenly cursing, "You insolent brat!"

"Since he is a disciple of Danfeng, he will naturally be dealt with by the senior disciple of Danfeng. What right do you have, disciples of Jianfeng, to interfere? Do you think Danfeng has no one to rely on?!"

The disciple was scolded into silence, and another disciple stepped forward, "Master, don't be angry. It's just that the senior disciple of Danfeng is currently waiting for the evil spirits in Kuzhu Village, but catching the spy is also urgent. According to the rules of Lingxi Peak, if a senior disciple of a peak is absent, the steward or senior disciple of that peak can temporarily take charge... and since our senior disciple is in charge of the mountain, he naturally has control over all three peaks."

Xia Ge was surprised that Confucius had spoken up for them.

The system was a bit confused, "How did you suddenly become a spy?"

Xia Ge said, "It might be because of that little puppet that exploded."

The system said, "Ah? Isn't that little puppet with Chu Yao? Did she give it to the senior disciple of Jianfeng?"

Xia Ge denied it, "That's impossible."

The system asked, "Then...?"

"I guess there were other people besides Chu Yao who saw the little puppet at that time," Xia Ge frowned, "But why... are they only investigating now?"

The system said, "That disciple said steward... steward... could it be the token that Bixi gave you this morning?"

Just as Gu Peijiu had left yesterday, the rooster had just crowed this morning when Bixi came over and gave her a well-wrapped small package, telling her to keep it safe. When she asked what it was, Bixi only said it was a token and didn't mention its use.

Xia Ge didn't quite believe it, "Really? Steward? How could Senior Sister give me such an important thing?"

The system said, "Why not? Don't worry about it. Did you bring it with you?"

Xia Ge said, "I left it in my dormitory this morning... I didn't think it was useful, so I put it away."

The system said, "You should have carried it with you, you idiot!"

Xia Ge said, "What if I lost it by carrying it with me?! Senior Sister told me to keep it safe!"

The system said, "Why didn't you think about the possibility of it being stolen from your dormitory?!"

Xia Ge suddenly realized, "Oh, right."
System: "..." suffocated.

On the other side, the master and disciples of the Sword Peak were still at a stalemate. The master sneered, "You have a lot of nerve trying to take away my disciple without any evidence."

The leading disciple took out a token and said, "We have a search warrant from the Sword Peak."

The master shouted, "I only recognize the search warrants from my Dan Peak and Lingxi Peak. If your big disciple is so capable, let him bring out the search warrant from Lingxi Peak. Old man, I won't say it twice, release my disciple immediately."

The disciple was speechless at the words.

Each peak's big disciple can issue a search warrant for their own peak, but the search warrant for the entire Lingxi Peak can only be issued by the Lingxi sect leader.

The Sword Peak disciples outside were tightly surrounded, while a few disciples and the master were at a stalemate inside. The disciples reading inside couldn't help but peek out and guess what was happening.

"What's going on outside?"

"It seems that Xia Wuyin is a spy for the demonic cult?"

"How is that possible..."

"Tsk..."

"..."

System: "What should we do? Have you thought of a solution? Your master can't hold on for much longer."

Xia Ge said, "How about this, I'll go get that token first, and then we'll see how it goes..." she said.

Before she could finish her sentence, a piercing alarm sounded!

"Beep - boom -"

The brilliant alarm fireworks exploded into countless gorgeous colors in broad daylight. The leading disciple exclaimed, "Demonic cult attack?! How is that possible?!"

The master's face became serious, and the disciples in the hall were in a commotion. The master said, "Silence!"

Another Sword Peak disciple was sweating on his forehead. "What should we do?!"

"Several capable disciples from the Sword Peak have gone to the Evil Ghost Tide over there!"

"Could this be a plan by the demonic cult?!"
Xia Ge didn't care about the schemes of the demonic cult, and as soon as she had the chance, she ran away, shouting, "Holy shit, this is a great opportunity to escape!"

"Who's running away? Catch him!!"

Master asked Xia Ge, "Lu Qie, could you please go down the mountain and bring me some feather grass?"

"I'll do it, Master!"

Xia Ge replied loudly as she ran away.

However, one of the disciples saw the doll hanging from Xia Wu Yin's waist and sneered, "Master, I heard that your Dan Peak Creed has the words 'No trust, no standing.' You'd better not discredit your Dan Peak by arresting people without evidence."

Then he said, "That's not Lu Qie! That's Xia Wu Yin! Catch him!"

Master also sneered, "Choosing people based on their trustworthiness is one thing, but blindly arresting people without evidence is not in line with the Dan Peak Creed. You sword peak disciples with dog shit in your eyes don't match those words."

Another disciple was about to draw his sword, but the leader stopped him and said coldly, "We came here to arrest someone with evidence! Once I catch him, I'll show you clearly!"

"Some of you go with me to catch him, and the others go down the mountain to protect the villagers! They're coming from the bottom of the mountain and may hurt a lot of people!"

Xia Ge ran through the courtyard and kicked over several disciples who had surrounded her. She moved like a ghost and ran very fast. The people behind her became more convinced that she was a spy for the demonic cult.

"Who can fly on a sword?! Catch him and take him to the mountain prison!"

"The disciples who can fly on a sword are all at the Evil Ghost Tide..."

"Shut up!"

"Yes, sir!"

Xia Ge ran in circles and shook off the disciples who were chasing her. She ran to her own dormitory, but as expected, she was surrounded by disciples from the Sword Peak.

Xia Ge hid behind a mountain ash tree and quickly untied her head rope. Her black hair fell down, and she kissed her fingertips, whispering, "Hey, did you see those people? You need to be tied up like this."

Little Xiangsi obeyed and jumped out.

One of the guards was holding a sword and chatting with another disciple.

"Did you see the fireworks just now...? It seems that the demonic cult is attacking the mountain?"

"Just shut up. We were told to watch here. That guy will definitely come this way. The demonic cult...should be dealt with by someone else..."
The man spoke with a hint of uncertainty, appearing somewhat uneasy.

Xia Ge squinted his eyes slightly.

Little Xiangsi had already crawled to their feet and quietly burrowed underground, exploring like a worm in the soil. Its thin red ribbon was like a red snake, slowly winding around their feet.

"Where did that little brat run off to?"

"Search carefully!"

"Maybe... back to the dormitory?"

"Tsk, it's possible. You, you, and you, go check the dormitory area."

"Okay..."

There were faint sounds of commotion in the distance. Someone was approaching!

Xia Ge's pupils contracted slightly as he sensed Xiangsi's location. He whispered, "Retract!"

As soon as he spoke, countless scarlet ribbons shot up from the soil, covering the mouths of several disciples who were caught off guard and hadn't even drawn their swords yet. Then, countless ribbons spread out, binding the people into bundles.

"BINGO!"

Xia Ge emerged from behind the mountain ash tree and rushed into his dormitory. He moved his bed and dug out a small box buried underground. "Ah, it's not lost..."

System: "... Of course it's not lost."

Xia Ge threw the box into the flowing silver.

System: "Then what?"

Xia Ge: "Wait... I feel like I forgot something..."

Outside the window, the shadows of the three disciples were already visible. They had obviously seen the guard outside tied up like a rice dumpling and were frightened. Two were hesitating and not daring to come over, while the other went back to report.

Although he felt like he had forgotten something, it was clearly not the time for quiet reminiscing.

Xia Ge grabbed a brush, turned it over, and struck the man's leg with a single hit. She controlled her strength and didn't hit too hard. The man was struck heavily in the shin with the brush and fell to his knees, looking extremely miserable.

Xia Ge went out, used Ghost Shadow to climb onto the roof, hooked her hand, and retrieved Xiangsi. The people below, who had been slapped and tied into bundles by Xiangsi, crawled up from the ground, their hair disheveled and their faces full of confusion about what had just happened.
"Stand up."

The disciple who was reporting the news obviously didn't need to anymore.

The voice was extremely gloomy. The kneeling disciple saw several pairs of boots in front of him. When he raised his head, he saw the leading disciple of Jianfeng who had caught up. He stood up in a sorry state, patted his clothes, and glared at Xia Ge with hatred.

Xia Ge sat on the rooftop, with lovesickness entwined around her fingertips. The red silk ribbon was stained with a little dirt, and she wiped it off with a bit of regret. "Oh, it's dirty now..."

Then she looked down at the people below, tied up her hair again with a little lovesickness, and looked down from a high place. "Hey, why are you guys chasing me instead of going down the mountain to exterminate demons and uphold justice?"

"Xia Wuyin, stop talking nonsense!"

"Come down and come with us!"

"Hey, I am Lu Qie, not Xia Wuyin. Don't block me. I still have to go down the mountain to get things for my master..."

As Xia Ge spoke, she leisurely took out a small box from her ring, opened it, took out the small package inside, and took out the token inside.

The token was crimson, with a maple leaf painted on it and two characters engraved on it.

[Commander].

It really was the commander...

"Spit! You are Xia Wuyin! That doll around your waist must be your puppet, right?! You are the puppet master of the Demon Cult, the spy of the Demon Cult!"

The person below cursed in pain. "You are really shameless and causing harm to the world!"

Xia Ge couldn't be bothered to argue with him. There was no point in responding or admitting to something that didn't exist.

She looked at the commander token in her hand, and her mind went blank for a moment.

The commander token was the temporary senior disciple of Danfeng.

Therefore, while enjoying the rights, one also had to assume all the responsibilities and obligations of Danfeng.

Did Senior Sister give this to her...?

Xia Ge's pupils suddenly shrank!

She muttered to herself, "Wait, wait a minute... The Demon Cult came down from the mountain?"
System: "Of course, attacking a mountain should be done from the bottom up."

In an instant, she thought of the last thing Mao Qing said to her when they met earlier -

"Master asked me to go down the mountain to get something."

The next moment, the cursing disciple from Jianfeng saw a blur before his eyes, and when he looked up, there was no one on the roof, only a residual image left behind due to the speed!

"Where did he go?!"

"He ran away again!!"

"Damn it!! Chase him!"

"He ran down the mountain!"

"Damn it! Don't let him join the demonic cult!"

With the Ghost Shadow Trace pushed to its limit, there was no scenery, only an endless mix of colors forming a residual image.

System: "Where are you running to?!"

Xia Ge tightly held onto the token and hoarsely said, "Down the mountain, Mao Qing!"
