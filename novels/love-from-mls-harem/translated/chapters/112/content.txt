There is the sound of water droplets falling.

Very light.

Very loud.

It's like a long, long time ago, after the rain stopped, she sat alone under the eaves and listened quietly to the sound of the remaining water droplets falling from the eaves.

Wind chimes would ring, people would laugh, but only under her eaves, the dripping sound was like someone crying.

In luxurious clothing and an elegant posture, her mother, who was high above her, gently touched her cheek.

"As soon as you opened your eyes, your status was determined..."

Those beautiful lips lightly uttered three words.

"Little slut."

It seemed like it was raining again.

It had just cleared up.

Her mother's figure became blurred.

She couldn't even remember her face.

Because it was really far away.

She looked up, and the sky that had just had a rainbow was now darkening. The dripping sound from the eaves started to become a rushing stream, like a waterfall pouring down. Even though the wind was so cold and fierce, the sound of the wind chimes became distant until it couldn't be heard anymore.

For a long time, a long time.

A long coldness.

The water droplets under the eaves started to drip again.

Slowly, darkness eroded everything, and the coldness gradually dissipated, replaced by a warmth that was familiar yet somewhat unfamiliar.

She leaned against the man's back, her hands around his neck, feeling very warm.

"...Brother Aze."
The sound of water droplets, one after another.

It was a bit cold, but seemed to have a hint of warmth.

Upon hearing this, the person beneath her paused for a moment, but didn't reply and continued walking forward in silence.

The road was bumpy, but the young man walked steadily.

It was like a long time ago.

He could carry her and walk a long, long way to the young man who cured her illness.

It was also like this, with his thin shoulders, but so warm, comforting her heart.

Who was he?

...It didn't really matter who he was.

It had been a long time since there was someone who could let her have a good dream about that time.

It wasn't a self-deception.

It was almost identical, close to that person, to an incredible... warmth.

"Hush... don't talk," Chu Yi murmured. "Let me... dream."

It didn't matter who he was.

Even if it was just a dream, she hoped that this dream could last a little longer, even longer.

It was as if she didn't notice the momentary stiffness of the person beneath her.

"Where are we?" Chu Yi asked softly, as if back to many, many years ago.

For a moment, Xia Ge was stunned by this situation and question.

Without the destined son of heaven, Ye Ze, by her side, the effects of the Heavenly Eye Grass couldn't be sustained. Calculating the time, Chu Yi's eyes should be unable to see again.
So she bought a voice-changing medicine in the mall.

She thought Chu Yi had woken up, but it seemed like he hadn't.

Life is like a dream, and people live only once, half awake and half asleep.

It was bitter that she had schemed so much, and upon reflection, it was so annoying.

It made people sad.

Chu Yi's voice was soft and hazy.

- Let me dream.

The journey was hard, and getting lost was bitter, but if she could, then... let this child have a sweet dream.

This was what Xia Ge owed.

Xia Ge was silent for a moment, her voice gently soothing her.

The voice that had been changed was a bit hoarse.

But it was gentle.

"We're on the road."

Warm tears slowly slid down Chu Yi's cheeks, soaking Xia Ge's already somewhat damp clothes. The originally cold clothes made the temperature of the tears feel a bit hot.

This was a beautiful dream in the Bai Meng Acupoint.

So, why cry?

Chu Yi's voice was a bit choked up, but she held onto Xia Ge's shoulder and asked her word by word, "... What road is that?"

Xia Ge slowly said, "The road of life."

After a moment's pause, she smiled gently, "Just kidding."

Time reversed, as if that day, the stars were shining, and the blindfolded little girl was carried by the young man, walking a very long way under the stars.

The little girl woke up, feeling a bit confused.
"Where are we?" 

"We're on the road." 

"What road?" 

"The road of life." The young man was serious for a moment before laughing. "Haha, just kidding. Go back to sleep for a bit. Big brother walks fast, we'll be there soon." 

The water in the cave dripped steadily. 

Although her clothes were soaked with tears, the memories were warm with a hint of coolness. 

Chu Yi's heart, however, was incredibly calm. 

Like an unfilled black hole. 

The calmness was suffocating. 

The person on her back was quiet, but the tears still burned. 

Xia Ge suddenly felt a little sad. 

Those lost and wandering times when they couldn't find their way. 

This child spent them with her. 

After a long time, when Xia Ge thought she had fallen asleep again, Chu Yi's voice rang out once more. 

Like she was sleepwalking, she murmured, "Is big brother still going to find that person?" 

Xia Ge whispered, "No, I'm not." 

Chu Yi seemed to smile, but the cave was too dark for Xia Ge to see. She could only hear her soft voice. 

"Then, are you still going to leave me?" 

Was this a dream? 

It was one person's beautiful dream. 

Xia Ge didn't answer for a long time.
Perhaps she could be a little less responsible, tell a lie, and fulfill this person's beautiful dream.

After all, this is the White Dream Cave.

Everything could be an illusion, everything could be a mirage. Occasionally telling some well-intentioned lies, fake promises, seemed to be irrelevant.

But she couldn't say it, no matter what.

Even if it was just a dream.

Irrelevant lies seemed so irrelevant when spoken.

After all, some things are really irrelevant.

Just like saying the sun in the sky is green, an irrelevant lie, everyone knows what color the sun is, and they just laugh it off.

But sometimes, some things are different.

It's not a lie.

It's a promise.

It cannot be treated as non-existent just by saying it.

Just like when she promised Dou Dou to live well.

So she is here now.

Some words, even in a dream, can be believed by someone.

If they believe it.

When they wake up, they will also feel sad.

It has been a long time since she got an answer. Maybe she will never get an answer.

"...It's very bitter."

Chu Yi slowly hugged the person's neck beneath her, her head leaning against the person's left shoulder, rolling tears slowly overflowing. The usually proud girl seemed to have turned into a crying mess. She choked and said with a low voice, "Brother, it's bitter."
"It's so bitter...really, so bitter."

Walking alone is really bitter.

The girl cries in sadness.

Xia Ge also feels very sad listening to her.

Walking alone is always bitter, but she cannot accompany her.

This child has a proper identity, she is a pampered young lady who can have a good life, return to the Chu family, be willful and arrogant, and live as a high and mighty sun.

But she may be lonely.

That is also a brilliant loneliness like the sun, or a loneliness like the moon surrounded by stars.

Loneliness may be a bit bitter.

But life is so long.

After enduring bitterness for a long time, she will eventually meet the candy that belongs to her.

And she is a puppeteer, this road is already subject to public criticism, and she is not even sure where her future lies. Although Danfeng Retirement sounds good, Xia Ge has no idea whether she can retire or not.

It was unnecessary to be entangled in the first place.

So why bother.

The girl on her back is still crying.

She wanted to give her a beautiful dream, but instead made her cry.

Xia Ge is really a scumbag.

Xia Ge took a few steps and couldn't help but stop again. She touched her pocket and found that there were only two sakura candies in it.

For a moment, Xia Ge hesitated.

The system sighed deeply, "You are really a scumbag."

Xia Ge: "..."
Xia Ge flipped the ring for a while and despairingly found that the only thing she had to eat besides the fasting pill was the two cherry blossom candies that she happened to have in her pocket.

She didn't have any other types of candies.

The girl on her back choked and sobbed.

"Bitter..."

Xia Ge fell silent for a while, peeled off a cherry blossom candy, and stuffed it into the girl's mouth.

In an instant, she didn't want to think about all the complicated things and didn't want to think about her identity.

She just wanted to tell her.

Don't cry anymore.

Don't feel bitter anymore.

It sounded very uncomfortable.

After completing all of this in a routine manner, Xia Ge re-carried the girl who had been fed candy and, as usual, continued walking forward. "We don't have candied haws this time, so let's make do with candy."

The taste of cherry blossom candy spread on her tongue.

In an instant, it was as if she had just woken up from a dream.

Chu Yi slightly stiffened.

"Although the road is a bit bitter, eat a candy and keep going on the path that you have to take," Xia Ge muttered to herself, not knowing if she was talking to herself or to the person on her back. "Someday..."

You will find that candy that belongs to you.

The taste of cherry blossom candy was sweet, like the brilliant cherry blossoms blooming in the spring, and in its splendor, there was a hint of decay.

Just like that day, the sunny day in the bookshop with its dusty sunlight, and just like the moment when she saw the red-haired boy with a red headband staring at her with his pained and complex gaze.

And the candy that fell.

That candy with the taste of cherry blossoms.

Despite all of Xia Ge's calculations and contemplation, she never thought that the candy she left behind in the bookshop that day would become the final loophole.
Unexpectedly, Chu Yi at that time had already used her charm to see through her appearance.

"So that's how it is," she thought.

The girl on her back suddenly fell silent.

Xia Ge didn't think anything was wrong, assuming that she was tired of crying or perhaps had been pacified by the candy, and continued walking forward.

A butterfly silently flew out of the girl's sleeve and landed on Chu Yi's shoulder.

The image of a boy walking with a girl on his back quietly entered Xia Ge's heart through the butterfly's eyes.

"Brother," the girl's voice was soft, and the hand around Xia Ge's neck tightened slightly. "I've missed you so much all these years."

"Do you...occasionally think of me too?" Xia Ge responded with a sound.

Chu Yi smiled lightly.

She really was a liar.

But...such a clever liar.

Why didn't she want to...deceive her in her dreams?

Xia Ge felt his clothes getting wet again, with hot tears dropping one by one. The girl murmured, "That's really...great."

"Brother is so good," Chu Yi whispered. "There must be many people who like him."

Brother doesn't want to be with Chu Yi.

He must want to be with someone else.

Who could it be?

Is it Ye Ze?

Xia Ge hesitated for a moment, thinking about his awkward situation, and shook his head. "I don't think so."
——No, there isn't.

But, her brother is a fraud.

She will never trust anyone again.

"Yes, she is a fraud." A sinister voice, accompanied by the sound of butterflies, slowly echoed in her ears, vaguely with a hint of laughter. If clothes could smile, then its smile must be identical to the girl on Xia Ge's back—

Equally chilling.

Chu Yi murmured, "If no one likes her, how can her brother be happy?"

—But "Xia Wuyin" is really happy.

She gently kissed Xia Ge's black long hair. "Brother must be suffering a lot."

—Suffering? But that brother named Xia, he smiles every day.

He left her, gave up on her, and threw her to others.

Her brother, alone, can still...be very happy.

It's really chilling.
