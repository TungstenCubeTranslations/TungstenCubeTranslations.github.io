When the doctor came to treat Xia Wuyin's injury, Gu Peijiu's sleeve was tightly pulled by Xia Wuyin. Afraid that forcibly removing it would affect his wound, Gu Peijiu didn't move and let him pull it. Dr. Li touched his goatee and looked at Gu Peijiu without speaking, but clearly felt uneasy.

Gu Peijiu turned his back and said calmly, "It's okay."

Bixi couldn't help but speak up, "Miss..."

Gu Peijiu interrupted her, "You can go out."

Bixi hesitated for a moment before bowing and leaving.

With the sound of the bead curtain, Gu Peijiu closed her eyes and turned her body away, "Doctor, you can start now."

Dr. Li touched his beard and reluctantly began to pulse the young man who was pulling Gu Peijiu's sleeve. He looked at the young man's pale face and said, "Oh, it's this child..."

He sounded like he knew him.

In fact, he was the only doctor in the village, so it wasn't strange that he knew him. Dr. Li just casually mentioned it, but unexpectedly heard Gu Peijiu's voice, "Have you met him before?"

"I have." Dr. Li replied while feeling his pulse, furrowing his brows slightly, "This pulse...weak and feeble, physical weakness, excessive yin and insufficient yang."

He paused, "He brought a little girl to treat her injury before, and even paid for her. He almost didn't have enough money for himself. I think this child has a kind heart, so I gave him a discount on the medicine."

"I see..." Gu Peijiu looked out the window at the swaying green curtain, her voice shallow, "Could you please take a look at his injury?"

Dr. Li pondered for a moment, moved the black cloth around the young man's wound with his hand, and then found a pair of scissors from his medicine box. He asked Bixi to bring some hot liquor and carefully cut open the black cloth that was wrapped around the wound.

"Hiss..."

The young man seemed to have touched something painful, and Gu Peijiu paused, "...Doctor?"

"It's nothing. The bandage is stuck to the wound and needs to be removed." Dr. Li cut off the bandage wrapped around the young man's wound and threw the small piece of fabric that was clipped off the bloody wound into a small bucket beside him. "I don't know who bandaged it, but this kid is too careless and tore the wound again."

"Please..." The young man seemed to be dreaming and was very uneasy, "I'm not good at anything...I'm stupid...please...don't let me go...I won't go...let's go together..."

Was it the person named "Dou Dou"?

With his hand tightly gripping her clothes, Gu Peijiu paused and spoke softly, "Hmm, I won't let you go."

She turned her head slightly and looked back at the young man on the bed.

After she spoke, the young man seemed to feel relieved, but still held onto her clothes as if afraid of something.
His face was as pale as snow, with a slight moistness in the corners of his eyes. Due to excessive bleeding, his clothes in the abdomen were stuck together, and Doctor Li had to use scissors to cut them open. The bandage that was originally wrapped around the wound was also cut off, and at this moment, he was carefully cleaning the blood stains around the wound with cotton balls soaked in wine, revealing the original appearance of the wound.

The cut was neat, with blood stains, as if it had been stabbed directly by a short knife. One side of the skin was torn open, with a deep purple color around it, obviously caused by the wound tearing open when he hit the table earlier.

It was a bloody mess.

"This kid...sigh!" Seeing the wound in this state, Doctor Li's face changed a little. Although he had no personal relationship with the patient and the other party was still unconscious, as a doctor, he couldn't help but say, "...he really doesn't know how to be careful!"

Gu Peijiu stared at the wound, her hand clenched inside her sleeve, her thin lips tightly pursed, and a hint of coldness flickered in her eyes.

He really had some skill. After only three days, he managed to injure himself to this extent.

He wasn't focused on alchemy, but he was good at self-harm.

Gu Peijiu felt her emotions were slightly out of control, a kind of inexplicable anger rising within her. She stared at the tears in the corner of the boy's eyes for a while, then steadied her emotions and said calmly, "I fed her a hemostatic pill before."

"But can he still be cured?"

- No matter how angry she was, she had to wait until he woke up to speak.

"He can." Doctor Li nodded and then said, "Please turn around, my lord. I see that this kid is not lying very comfortably, and the bandage is wrapped around his whole body. There may be some injuries on his back that need to be dealt with."

Gu Peijiu looked at the boy's sleeve, which was gripped tightly by the boy, and after a while, she said coldly, "No need. Just treat him like this. I think he might have done something behind my back."

Doctor Li was slightly taken aback, "This..."

He looked at the boy on the bed again.

The boy's black hair was draped behind him, his face was as pale as snow, his figure was thin and weak, like a child who was only ten years old and had not yet fully grown.

Doctor Li glanced at the cold-faced girl, whose soft black hair was tied up with a red hairband, her forehead was smooth, and her black eyes were like an abyss without stars or moon. She stared at the boy on the bed, her lips tightly pursed. Perhaps because she was in charge of the affairs of Dan Peak, she had a certain aura of not being angry but imposing.

...Well, after all, he was still a child.

Doctor Li nodded slightly, then used scissors to cut the boy's broken clothes open. The black scraps and blood-stained white cloth strips fell down one after another, and the boy's upper body wrapped in bandages was exposed. He was about to continue cutting the bandage when he suddenly said, "Huh?"

Gu Peijiu also noticed that something was wrong.

The two of them stared at the white cloth strip that was obviously different from the bandage, and the air suddenly fell silent.
Doctor Li hesitated for two seconds.

"Could it be some hidden illness in the chest?" he asked.

The bandage was cut open, but the white cloth was left untouched. The boy's skin was exposed, and it was not noticeable on a daily basis, but with the bandage removed, his skin was as white and tender as snow, crystal clear like jade, and the skin was so beautiful that it didn't seem like a boy's.

The anger subsided, and regardless of whether the other party had any hidden illness, Gu Peijiu felt that it was not good for her, a girl, to stare at a boy's body. She turned her face to the side and spoke in a cold voice, "Doctor, please look at the injury first."

Her ears, however, turned slightly red.

Doctor Li looked at the white cloth wrapped around the boy's chest, and out of respect for the patient's hidden illness, he did not remove it. He helped the boy up, but as soon as he did, he gasped in shock. "This..."

Gu Peijiu turned her head, but she didn't ask the question "What happened?" Her black pupils reflected the bed's bright red bloodstains and the bandage on the boy's back soaked with blood. For a moment, she was speechless.

Doctor Li's face darkened. He carefully peeled off the bandage that was stuck to the wound on the boy's back with scissors. The boy's trembling muscles were holding onto Gu Peijiu's clothes tightly, muttering something, but he still didn't wake up.

After cleaning the wound, Gu Peijiu couldn't care less about male and female boundaries and stared at the boy's back, biting her lip and not saying a word.

Doctor Li frowned, and the scars on the boy's smooth back crisscrossed, some already cracked and stained with blood, looking ferocious and terrifying. He looked carefully and said, "It seems to be whip marks."

Xia Ge was injured by the Black Vine in Qinling before, and after the Night Pearl was shattered, the Black Vine disappeared into smoke, leaving scars on his back that looked like whip marks. It was no wonder he was mistaken.

"Whip marks?" Gu Peijiu clenched her hand, her voice still cold. "But in just three days, where can he get so many whip marks?"

Doctor Li pondered and didn't say anything. Obviously, he didn't know where this kid could roll himself into such a miserable state. Gu Peijiu also thought that she had acted impulsively and paused before saying, "I'm sorry... I was impulsive. Please treat his injuries first, Doctor."

Doctor Li agreed and carefully changed the dressing and wrapped the bandage back up. After finishing, he sighed, "This child's pulse is weak and lacks vitality. He has a feminine appearance and has suffered such serious injuries. It's not a good sign."

After hearing this, Gu Peijiu remained silent for a while before asking, "When will he wake up?"

"He won't wake up for at least two to three days." Doctor Li sighed. "But he took the Pill of Fasting before, so there's no need to worry about the cycle of the five grains. As long as he rests well for a few days, he'll be fine."

"Just now, when I took his pulse, I found that he hasn't rested for a long time and he also suffered an injury in his sea of consciousness." Doctor Li shook his head. "It seems that he has been plagued by nightmares. I'll prescribe a calming medicine for him so he can rest well."

Gu Peijiu knew that the injury to his sea of consciousness was because this kid was too stubborn and forcibly stopped the ancient Gathering Spirit Formation, which caused a backlash and was injured by spiritual energy.

Indeed, mental injuries should be well rested.

After Doctor Li left, Gu Peijiu looked at the sleeve that the boy had pulled tightly and her eyes softened slightly. But when she looked up and saw the stupid look on his face with the bandage wrapped around him like a rice dumpling, and the scars on his body, a sense of inexplicable anger rose in her heart.
If you don't cherish yourself, why would others cherish you?

She snorted and grabbed the boy's wrist, gently trying to pull his hand away. As she held his wrist, Gu Peijiu suddenly noticed how slender and white his wrist was, and how his thin and delicate fingers didn't seem like those of a boy.

Her mind wandered for a moment, but the sleeping boy seemed to sense her intentions and tightened his grip, his pale face becoming even more distressed. "No, don't go. Don't leave me..."

He clung tightly to her sleeve, his round nails sinking deep into the fabric and then into her palm, desperately trying to hold onto her even though he knew he couldn't. Gu Peijiu paused in her movements.

The sun was setting.

The girl in the red dress lowered her long eyelashes and gently lifted the boy's hand, holding it firmly and tenderly. She slowly peeled back his fingers that were tightly clasped in his palm, and the red fabric slid down from his hand. The boy's eyes were moist, and Gu Peijiu hesitated for a moment before finally holding his hand and intertwining their fingers.

She heard her own gentle voice, coaxing him, "Okay, I'll listen to you. I won't go."

The boy continued to tightly grasp her hand, his small hand bones turning white from the force.

It was as if he was holding onto his own beliefs.

She gently wiped away the tears from the corner of his eyes and let out a soft sigh.

After all, he was just a child who didn't understand anything yet.

Why should she argue with a child?

If something was wrong, she could teach him slowly in the future.

After all...there was still a long way to go.
