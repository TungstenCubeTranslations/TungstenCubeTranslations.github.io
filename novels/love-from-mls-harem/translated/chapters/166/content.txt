The text is a passage from a Chinese novel. Here's the translation:

A figure appeared in front of Chu Zhan, then transformed into a young girl wearing a blue dress. Her hair was soft and her almond-shaped eyes were watery.

Chu Zhan was stunned and his voice trembled as he spoke, "Yi Yi?"

He coughed a few times, causing the entire bed to shake. Chu Yi looked at her biological father, her lips curved into a smile, but her eyes were cold and devoid of sympathy.

She eventually poured a glass of water for him, "Father, drink some water."

Chu Zhan took the water and had a few sips, finally feeling better. He was a bit confused and asked, "You're back, why didn't you tell anyone?"

"No need to." Chu Yi smiled and covered up her icy gaze with tenderness. "I came to check on Father's condition."

Chu Zhan paused for a moment, feeling relieved. "It's fine."

"I thought so too." Chu Yi didn't waste any more words and went straight to the point. "So, does Father still want Sister to be the head of the family?"

Chu Zhan was taken aback. "This isn't just my decision."

"But if Father doesn't decide," Chu Yi spoke casually, her eyes cold, "no one will force Sister to be the head of the family."

Chu Zhan was speechless.

Chu Yi's expression showed no surprise. She finished speaking and turned to leave.

"Yi Yi!" Chu Zhan called out.

Chu Yi turned around.

Chu Zhan didn't know what to say. He owed this daughter too much - everything had gone wrong since he sent her to be fostered by the Yun family.

One wrong step, and everything went wrong.

But he never imagined that the Yun family would become so crazy.

"This is the decision of the uncles and aunts." Chu Zhan sighed at last. After thinking about it, this was all he could say.

"Father." Chu Yi turned back, her eyes cold and exuding an aura of gloom. "I've lost too much already."

She tightly grasped the rope-woven scabbard in her sleeve, the rough rope rubbing against her delicate palms. She spoke slowly, "Father, I also want to know what it feels like to gain something."

Facing his rebellious daughter, Chu Zhan was just an old father. He only felt tired and exhausted.
After all, he owed too much and could only compensate with too little.

A thousand words were on the tip of his tongue, but he only said three words.

"I'm sorry."

Chu Yi clenched the hilt of his knife and lowered his head, his expression momentarily contorted.

Sorry? Sorry?!

Why did everyone have to apologize to her?! Why did everyone owe her an apology?! On what grounds?!

Xia Wuyin was like this, and so was her father. Who else?!

"Father didn't do anything wrong, why should he apologize?" Chu Yi raised his eyes slightly, smiling as if basking in the spring breeze. "Father didn't owe anyone an apology, he just did the right thing."

Just like what Xia Wuyin did.

He didn't owe anyone an apology, he just did what he thought was right... that's all.

And in that "right thing," there could never be a place for her, Chu Yi.

The door creaked open suddenly.

Chu Yao stood at the door with a scroll in her hand. She looked up and saw Chu Yi, slightly stunned, then frowned.

The sisters faced each other, and Chu Yi smiled slightly.

"Long time no see, sister."
