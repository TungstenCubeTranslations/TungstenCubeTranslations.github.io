Chapter 216: Cowardly Turtle

In the face of danger, some people choose to face it head-on, while others choose to retreat and avoid it. The latter are often called cowards, and in some cases, they are compared to turtles who retract into their shells at the slightest sign of danger.

In this chapter, the protagonist encounters a character who is known for being a cowardly turtle. Despite having a strong and capable body, this character is unable to face any kind of challenge or adversity. Instead, he always chooses to run away or hide, leaving others to deal with the situation.

The protagonist initially finds this behavior frustrating and annoying, but as he gets to know the cowardly turtle better, he begins to understand the reasons behind his behavior. He learns that the turtle had a traumatic experience in the past that left him with a deep fear of danger and a lack of confidence in his own abilities.

Through patience and understanding, the protagonist is able to help the cowardly turtle overcome his fears and become more confident in himself. Together, they are able to face the challenges that come their way and achieve great things.

The chapter serves as a reminder that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and that it is important to be patient and understanding with others, especially when they are struggling. With a little help and encouragement, even the most cowardly turtle can become a brave and capable warrior.
