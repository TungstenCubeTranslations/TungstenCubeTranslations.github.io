Lingxi Peak.

Xia Wushuang led two deer using a teleportation stone and quickly arrived at the destination. As soon as she looked up, she saw a bustling crowd, a large group of people pressing against the foot of the mountain, making a lot of noise.

Xia Wushuang patted a person's shoulder and asked, "Hey, brother, what's going on here?"

"Everyone is here to demand an explanation from Xia Wushuang," the person glanced at her and the two deer she was holding, then turned his attention back to the crowd. "It's been almost half a month and there's still no explanation. Yesterday, two powerful people fought and scared them away, but they came back again today... It's ridiculous. If Xia Wushuang was willing to see them, they would have come down earlier. With the mountain protection barrier, who can climb up? Making noise at the foot of the mountain is useless... But Xia Wushuang is also a coward."

Xia Wushuang: "..."

She smiled awkwardly and asked, "So, were the two powerful people from yesterday able to finish the fight?"

"Who knows, they probably went somewhere else to fight, afraid of causing the mountain to collapse. Yesterday's fight was intense, but there was no news for half a day today. I don't know who won," the person replied impatiently.

"What are these people asking for? Just an explanation?" Xia Wushuang asked again.

The person found her question strange and gave her a curious look. "Where did you come from, miss?"

Xia Wushuang instinctively wanted to say "I came from the Tang Dynasty in the East," but she felt that it didn't fit the situation, so she just made up an excuse. "I came from Chang'an to see the excitement from far away."

The person glanced at the two deer in her hands and said, "These deer look pretty good, and you came from Chang'an. You must be rich."

"There are many requests, some for money, some to save people's lives, and some just for an explanation... It depends on the person. After all, living people need to be paid if they fight for others. It's unreasonable not to pay for puppets. The reason for lending people out is to reunite with family members after the war is over. If people die after the war, what's the point? If you die on the battlefield, it's for the glory of the country, but if you suddenly die at home, what's the point?" the person explained.

Xia Wushuang lowered her head, her black hair covering her eyes, feeling complicated.

She thought of what the old man had said and paused for a moment before asking the person, "Excuse me, can you watch these two deer for me? I'll go up and take a look."

The person was surprised. "These two deer look precious. Aren't you afraid I'll run away with them?"

Xia Wushuang smiled and took out a spirit stone. "If you run away, it's just a spirit stone. If you don't, I'll give you a spirit stone according to the value of the deer. How about that?"

The young man was stunned, holding the reins of the deer in his hand and staring blankly at the spirit stone. "Oh..."

Xia Wushuang thought that as long as the deer were within her line of sight, it should be fine, right? 

With someone watching the deer, Xia Wushuang straightened her clothes and flew up the mountain.
"Who is that?!"

"The protective mountain barrier of Lingxi Peak couldn't stop her..."

"...It's Xia Wushuang!"

"Master!!"

Xia Wushuang looked for a place with a clear view of the people below and announced loudly, "I am Xia Wushuang, the master of Lingxi Peak!"

There was a commotion below.

"Xia Wushuang, you have finally come out!"

"Give me back my son!"

"My husband and I made a promise ten years ago. We waited so long for his return, and the day after we celebrated our wedding, we have to hold this funeral!... You must give us an explanation today!"

"My elder brother fought for ten years, and finally returned to his hometown with honor. But before the new emperor ascended the throne and rewarded him for his achievements, he suddenly died the next day- what is this?!"

Behind the naked anger, there was despair that shattered in an instant after welcoming the return of loved ones. If there was no hope from the beginning, perhaps it wouldn't be so painful. But if you have already seen the bright light of dawn, and you walk towards that light with hope, only to fall back to the starting point, it is often the most despairing feeling.

Xia Wushuang stood silently in place, becoming the target of everyone's anger. This was her mistake to begin with. She thought everything was foolproof, she thought she could handle it. In the end, it was only her own delusion. Perhaps the letter from King Chu was just a spark, and what really pushed her to where she is today was her arrogance and overconfidence.

The person who had been leading the deer in the farthest distance looked at her in astonishment, feeling that the spiritual stone and reins in his hand were like a hot potato, neither able to hold on nor throw away.

"...I'm sorry." Xia Wushuang lowered her head, her voice clearly audible. "The news was blocked because of my seclusion, and the people around me didn't handle this matter well... Actually, I don't know how to handle it either, but I feel very sorry."

"Is an apology enough?!"
"You give me back my husband - you know puppetry, right?! Bring him back to life!" 

"What about my brother's military achievements?!" 

"..." 

Xia Wushuang patiently waited for them to finish and then said, "As for compensation, you can go to Lingxi Peak for monetary matters. As for military achievements...after Chu Wang ascends the throne, I will give her a personal letter to reward her for her achievements and compensate her doubly." 

Something was vaguely hot around her waist, and Xia Wushuang accidentally rubbed against it, only to find it was the Asking Love Sword. 

Why was the Asking Love Sword heating up? It seemed to have heated up a few times before... 

Xia Wushuang looked down at the mass of people below and put the question aside for now. 

...She would look at it later. 

Suppressing her doubts, Xia Wushuang continued, "As for the question of whether he can be resurrected again...people cannot be brought back to life once they have died. This is a very simple truth. It's just that at the time, there were internal and external problems, and Chu Wang urgently needed troops to fight outside. But ultimately, it was because I was too arrogant at the time." Xia Wushuang's voice was slow and clear. "If any of you have puppet relatives, even if it's just their corpses, please send them over, and I will comfort their souls..." 

"What did you say?!" 

"How long has it been! The person is already buried! Do you want us to dig up the corpse for you?!" 

"Is that your solution?! We waited ten years just for this?! I don't want your money, I don't need military achievements, and I can dig up the corpse for you! Can you bring my husband back to life?!" 

"Their souls probably don't want to see you again!" 

"..." 

Curses filled the air, and Xia Wushuang lowered her head, silent. 

She actually knew that the likelihood of them sending over the puppet was very small. It was like when someone important in the family had died, and the funeral had already been held, they had already knelt and cried, and then the person who caused the death suddenly appeared and said, "I don't think it's right that I caused their death. How about you dig up the body and I invite the best monk in the world to help them pass on?" 

If they didn't beat you up, they were already being nice. 

A disciple of Lingxi Peak whispered, "Master, come down, everything that needs to be said has been said..." 

"Forget it, they were already dead to begin with. Ten more years of life is already a bargain. Do they want more...do they really think puppeteers are gods? Man's heart is insatiable, like a snake swallowing an elephant..." 

"..." 

Xia Wushuang listened to both sides, unable to say anything.
For these ten years of life, it was not given by her. 

Instead, it was the puppets who consumed their own souls to earn their last chance at life. 

After death, they would transform into evil spirits or have their souls scattered. 

The current plan is to collect the puppet corpses and ban the use of puppetry. 

After being cursed by the people below, Xia Wu Shuang finally spoke, "I hope that those who sent the puppets will also come, and also, Lingxi Peak will no longer teach any puppetry." 

Wen Qing Sword seemed to be getting hotter and Xia Wu Shuang, standing on high ground, suddenly felt dizzy. 

Her heart also started to beat a little faster. 

With Xia Wu Shuang's final words, her disciple behind her exclaimed, "Master!! Please think twice!" 

In the past ten years, Lingxi Peak has become the birthplace of puppetry. The most elite puppet masters in the entire Fengyue Continent are here, with Xia Wu Shuang being the most prominent. 

Now that Xia Wu Shuang has personally said that Lingxi Peak will no longer teach puppetry, how can these disciples not be shocked? 

The common people below also looked at each other in confusion. 

After all, although these puppet soldiers have had accidents, puppetry is still a convenient tool for ordinary people. With just a piece of spirit stone, one can make some mechanical puppets to do small tasks for themselves and satisfy their desires as cultivators. 

The young boy who was leading the deer was listening while holding the reins, but he felt the rope tighten. He turned his head and saw that the two deer were restless, their four eyes staring at Xia Wu Shuang above. For some reason, he even felt anxiety from the faces of the two deer. 

The young boy held the spirit stone, confused and wondering if he was hallucinating. How could he see anxiety on the faces of the deer? 

Suddenly, someone asked below, "Master Xia, is the recent wave of evil spirits related to you?" 

The crowd below suddenly exploded into discussion like mosquitoes and flies, but they didn't dare to be too loud. Thousands of eyes were staring at Xia Wu Shuang, waiting for her answer. 

However, she did not answer. 

At some point, Xia Wu Shuang, dressed in a white robe, covered her eyes with one hand and trembled slightly, as if she was enduring something.
She remained silent.

Everyone looked at each other in confusion.

Someone below asked, "Master Xia, are you involved with the Evil Ghost Tide? Why did it appear after the puppet incident?"

On the mountain, the cold wind blew.

Xia Wushuang, with her slender figure, slowly moved her hand away, and a subtle and eerie killing intent filled the air.

Her disciples behind her instinctively took a step back, and one bold disciple timidly called out, "Master...?"

Her black hair fluttered in the wind.

She moved her delicate, snow-white hand away, closed her eyes, and placed her other hand on the Wenqing sword at her waist. The hem of her white clothes faintly revealed the blood-red, slender petals of the Higanbana flower.

"Kill..."

The mountain wind was strong, and the disciples below couldn't hear clearly, "...Master?"

"Xia Wushuang, Evil Ghost Tide..."

Although they felt that Xia Wushuang was a little strange, they believed they were in the right and that as the leader of a sect, she wouldn't do anything too excessive. The disciples became emboldened and someone shouted loudly, "Give us an answer!"

The cold wind blew.

The rolling killing intent instantly filled the area around Xia Wushuang. The next moment, her snow-white long sword was unsheathed, and a sharp and cold light flashed through the air. Her black hair flew up, inadvertently revealing the cold blood pupils of the young girl!
