Xia Ge was carried back by Chu Yao.

The young boy's body was very thin and soft when carried on the back, as expected, he was also very light.

After drinking too much alcohol, he was a bit confused, with a light scent of glutinous rice wine lingering on his body.

Chu Yao carried him and crushed the teleportation stone. In the moment when the light and shadow changed, she murmured.

"Why are you still so small."

But compared to the first time they met, he had already improved a lot.

This made her a bit hard to imagine that such a thin and small boy could use his weak body and a piece of jade to block the fatal sickle for a child before she arrived.

Clearly he was also so young.

But he was able to stand up straight in the face of absolute dominance, with sharp eyes and unyielding spirit. Even in the moment of bending down, he still had a strong backbone and was invincible.

In that moment.

She saw the fortitude that did not belong to his age in the eyes of this child.

- Because of the trials and hardships, he was unyielding.

Just a glance.

Chu Yao knew that she would like this child.

No reason.

Just like him.

The scenery in front of her changed, the prosperity of the sleepless city disappeared, and they had arrived at a village not far from Lingxi Peak.

"..."

The aftertaste of the sleepless city's glutinous rice wine was a bit strong, and Xia Ge was a little dizzy. "Ah... there are stars..."

Chu Yao: "..."

Unlike the clear night in the sleepless city, tonight, the clouds were gathering around Lingxi Peak, and the moonlight could only shine through the cracks with a faint glow.
At this hour... the sky is almost bright.

Where did the stars come from?

Chu Yao carried Xia Ge towards Lingxi Peak, without using teleportation stones or light skills.

Let her dissipate the smell of alcohol.

She idly thought.

The breeze blew away the sticky rice wine scent on Xia Ge's body, and also brought a few deep red maple leaves. One of them drifted onto Xia Ge's head, and she grabbed it, laughing foolishly. "Red... it's red..."

The red maple leaves fell one by one, and before they knew it, it was already deep autumn.

Even though Chu Yao didn't walk for long, the eastern sky gradually turned white, the darkness before dawn dissipated, and the morning mist dispersed. Their city that never sleeps finally welcomed the break of dawn.

Chu Yao didn't walk a few more steps before she saw the sword peak that symbolized Lingxi Peak's highest point.

"Xia Wuyin."

"Grow up a little more."

"Okay..."

"If I don't come back."

Chu Yao paused. "...When you grow up a little more, come to Chang'an to find me and play."

Xia Ge murmured, feeling a bit drowsy after not sleeping for a day and night and drinking so much. "Okay."

Chu Yao then continued to carry her forward for a while. The sword peak gradually became clear in the morning mist, and a slender girl in a red maple-colored robe appeared through the dissipating clouds.

Chu Yao stopped and looked at Gu Peiju, who was not far away.

It seemed like she had been waiting for a long time. Her eyelashes were slightly frosted, but her black eyes showed no emotions, like a puppet without feelings.

Chu Yao's light brown eyes faintly slid over something subtle.

That person named Gu Peiju... even if she was calm and tranquil, Chu Yao could feel that she had something very similar to her.

What was it?
...Tsk.

She seemed a bit unhappy.

She called out, "Xia Wuyin."

"....Mm." Xia Ge hugged her neck, holding a red maple leaf in his hand. He looked dazed and couldn't quite open his eyes, but still responded, "I'm here."

Not far away, Gu Peiju, with frosty white lashes, had black eyes reflecting Xia Ge, who was drunk and didn't know which way was up. It was as if a switch had been flipped on a puppet; Xia Ge suddenly had emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. Her red lips pursed slightly, and her expression turned cold as ice.

Chu Yao looked up at Gu Peiju and smirked, her sharp little tiger teeth reflecting a glimmer of light.

The light blue and white soft silk, tied with a beautiful butterfly knot at the waist, softened Chu Yao's domineering temperament. However, old habits die hard - she carried Xia Ge on her back, not looking at Gu Peiju, and whispered something to Xia Ge. Her tone was low and carried a hint of recklessness and provocation.

Chu Yao said, "I really like your clothes."

Gu Peiju stood still, expressionless, letting Chu Yao pass by with the culprit of the night's debauchery on her back.

Gu Peiju wondered if it was because of the morning mist that had not yet cleared, or if she had stood in one place for too long, that she felt so cold all over?

The dawn's radiance was dim and brilliant.

Gu Peiju opened her red lips to say something, but suddenly her clothes were grabbed.

In an instant, a thousand words were silenced.

Gu Peiju looked up.

The thin hand was very white and a bit small.

Chu Yao paused for a moment, turned her head slightly, and her light brown eyes met Gu Peiju's gaze.

A silent stalemate.

But in reality, the culprit of the night's debauchery had a claw around Chu Yao's slender neck and was struggling to grab onto Gu Peiju's snow-white shoulder.

Gu Peiju: "..."
Chu Yao: "......"

Xia Ge stared fixedly at the delicate embroidery of the red maple on the wide sleeve under her hand. After a while, she jumped off Chu Yao's back on her own initiative, like a drunk rabbit. Her hand followed the loose sleeve down until she held the exquisite embroidered maple leaf at the cuff of Gu Peiju's sleeve.

She carefully compared the real maple leaf in her hand with the embroidered maple leaf on the sleeve.

Chu Yao raised an eyebrow.

Gu Peiju remained expressionless.

There was still a drunken blush on Xia Ge's cheek, and a faint scent of glutinous rice wine wafted from her. She pinched the cuff of Gu Peiju's sleeve and observed it for a while before happily saying, "Ah...yes, this is it."

Gu Peiju remained silent.

She looked at her.

Xia Ge smiled, but her cat-like eyes were tinged with drunkenness and tiredness, like a dream or a trance. She quietly pulled open the sleeve embroidered with red maple, as if no one would notice her small movements. Then, she carefully stuffed the bright red maple leaf she had grabbed with her left hand into Gu Peiju's hand.

Perhaps because of the alcohol, or perhaps because she had been standing here for too long, Gu Peiju felt that the girl's usually cold hand had an unusual warmth when their fingertips touched.

This warmth flowed from her fingertips and spread throughout her body, finally condensing into a comforting warmth in her heart.

Gu Peiju stood still for a moment.

The maple leaves that fell in late autumn were slightly frosted, but the cold frost was melted by the girl's warm hand, and holding it in her palm was also an unusual experience.

There was no chill, only a warm feeling.

Xia Ge's voice was small, "This is Senior Sister's sleeve." She looked up at Gu Peiju with her slightly tipsy cat-like eyes, as if talking to herself, "So, this is Senior Sister's hand."

"...Senior Sister's hand is so cold."

The girl stretched out her hands and held the cool hand that held the maple leaf. "Senior Sister...I'm good to you, right?"

"So, Senior Sister, don't be angry."

Her childish voice sounded like a real child acting spoiled.

Chu Yao watched from the side and sneered softly, "So childish."
I can't bear to watch anymore.

She finished speaking and turned to leave, but after a few steps, she stopped and turned back.

"Hey, don't forget," she said.

Xia Ge was still holding Gu Peijiu's hand, looking a bit lost as she turned her head.

Chu Yao said, "..."

Chu Yao was a little angry and said, "Don't forget to come to Chang'an! I'll take you to play!"

Xia Ge's eyes lit up and she blurted out, "Can we go now?"

Gu Peijiu, "..."

Chu Yao's mouth curved slightly, revealing her small tiger teeth. "If you want to..."

Xia Ge felt that the hand she was holding had become a little colder.

She didn't even think about playing anymore. When she turned her head, she saw Gu Peijiu's calm gaze. The next second...

Xia Ge seriously answered Chu Yao, "I don't want to."

Chu Yao, "..."

Xia Ge turned back to look at Gu Peijiu again. Gu Peijiu looked at her expressionlessly, and the two locked eyes. Xia Ge blinked and whispered, "If Senior Sister is angry, I'll have to coax her."

She turned back to look at Chu Yao again, her face showing signs of drunkenness, but her eyes were bright. She said seriously, "Senior Sister is not easy to coax."

Chu Yao, "..."

I'm not easy to coax either!!! Not easy to coax!!!

Pah, coax my ass!

= =

Chu Yao left.

The ceremony for advancing to the Profound level went by in a blur because Xia Ge had drunk too much at the Nevernight City's after-party and spent the whole time giggling.
The Xuan-level ceremony invited many people from other sects.

"Forgive me for being presumptuous..." A Taoist-looking person flicked his dusting brush and said to the people next to him, "Why does this newly promoted Xuan-level alchemist from Dan Peak look a bit silly?"

Xia Ge closed her mouth and didn't say anything, just let her senior sister hold her hand and smiled.

Gu Peijiu walked by and said lightly, "If you think it's presumptuous, wouldn't it be better not to ask?"

The Taoist: "..."

This Xuan-level promotion ceremony went smoothly except for the protagonist smiling all the way through.

Well, maybe.

However, the smooth surface could not conceal the surging undercurrents in the depths.

Gu Peijiu felt the girl holding her hand tighten slightly.

She lowered her head to look at Xia Ge.

Xia Ge didn't look at her and still had that silly smile on her face, as if she hadn't sobered up from the alcohol.

However, Gu Peijiu followed her gaze and saw the girl with silver butterfly embroidered on her cuff sitting quietly at the table, with a gentle forehead and clear black pupils. When she saw Gu Peijiu looking over, she even gave a polite and reserved soft smile.

Chu Yi.

Gu Peijiu nodded slightly in return.

After a while, Ye Ze came over and sat next to her. When Chu Yi saw Ye Ze, she narrowed her eyes and smiled even sweeter, as if she had seen a beloved lover.

But Ye Ze seemed a little absent-minded.

Everything seemed normal, yet something was off.

It was hard to say what was wrong.

Gu Peijiu took a glance around. The ceremony was grand with people from other sects coming over, and the people from Dan Peak were all present...but...

Xia Ge tilted her head, her mind still a little dizzy, and the people she saw seemed to have a bit of double vision.

But...
Even if it's a double image...

"Hmm... I'm missing a friend," she looked up at Gu Peiju and repeated, "Senior Sister, I'm missing a friend."

At the same time...

Jianfeng was not like Danfeng, which liked to plant flowers and plants, and didn't like to plant trees. In short, it was rough and liked to plant practical fruit trees. But if other types of trees grew, they would turn a blind eye... Actually, it was just laziness.

This maple tree could be said to be Jianfeng's characteristic, known as the "Sword Maple" because its leaves resemble swords.

In fact, Xiaga had always thought that the Sword Maple had grown crooked and mutated.

And now, Su Chan was lazily playing the flute under the Sword Maple, his voice very light and shallow.

After a while...

A young man wearing Jianfeng's clothes flashed over and knelt in front of Su Chan with one knee.

Su Chan put away the flute, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. "Did you say everything?"

Li Liu lowered his head, "Reporting to the Lord, everything went smoothly."

Not far away, the sound of Danfeng's salute sounded.

Su Chan propped his cheek, his narrow eyes slightly curved. "Everything went smoothly..."

Presumably, before long, the orphan of the Ye family, who knew that his family's enemies were in the Jianfeng Mountain Prison, would not be able to resist and pick up the butcher knife.

"You may leave."

Li Liu complied.

With a light laugh, Su Chan stood up, transformed into Mao Qing's appearance again, and quietly looked at Danfeng not far away. She tilted her head slightly, and in the next moment, she had disappeared like a ghost.

-"Senior Sister, I'm missing a friend."

And in the lively hall, the girl looked at Xia Ge, who was being led by Gu Peiju, her lips smiling brightly and warmly.

-"Ah, Xia Wuyin, are you looking for me?"
Xia Ge slightly opened her eyes and saw Mao Qing's shadow in the reflection. After a moment, she smiled.

"Ah, I was just looking for you. What did you do at Sword Peak just now?" 

Su Chan's face remained unchanged, but with a glance, she noticed that there was a thin maple leaf from Sword Peak on her sleeve!

And Xia Ge stared at her tightly, holding Gu Peijiu's hand, looking very silly and innocent - 

"Why is there a maple leaf on your sleeve?"
