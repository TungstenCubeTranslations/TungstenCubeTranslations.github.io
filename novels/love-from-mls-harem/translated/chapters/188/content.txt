The Qianhun Sect is far away in the wilderness, and the wind is always cold here no matter when.

In the boundless wilderness, the howling of jackals and wolves can be vaguely heard.

The Qianhun Sect is very large, with magnificent buildings and decorations. Xiage found the highest place and quietly played the flute for a while.

The sound of the flute was messy, without any melody.

It was like playing randomly without any care.

After playing for a while, Xiage felt bored and simply threw the flute away.

A black shadow flashed by, and a masked young man caught the flute, knelt not far away from her, and respectfully presented it to her with both hands.

Xiage sneered, "Are you afraid that I will run away?"

The young man replied in a muffled voice, "The leader said that you can go wherever you want, but we are afraid that we won't be able to take care of you properly."

"Too careless." Xiage stood up, and the cloud pattern on her black belt rolled. "Why did you catch it? Throw the flute away and smash it."

Her voice was cold.

The young man didn't dare to move.

Even if he had a hundred times more courage, he wouldn't dare to smash Xiage's Ba Huang flute.

"Not going to smash it? Then kneel here."

Xiage didn't even look at him, and her figure disappeared in a flash.

The young man held the flute and knelt in place, and two black shadows followed him.

The young man didn't move.

After a while.

A red robe swayed gracefully, and a snow-white delicate hand slowly took the flute from the young man's hand.

The fingers were as long as scallions, as white as jade, as delicate as rouge, and for a moment, it was hard to tell whether they were white jade or snow-white skin.

The girl in the red dress was like a blooming red lotus, and when she smiled, she was a stunning beauty with blood and poison.
"Why didn't you fall?" 

Su Chan's voice was soft and seductive. 

The young man's forehead broke out in a cold sweat, but his voice remained steady. "It was my fault, I didn't do my job properly." 

If he fell, he would be punished. But if he didn't fall, he would still be punished. 

Su Chan lazily stroked her flute, her movements gentle and affectionate, as if she were caressing her lover. "Go down and chop off a finger to remember this lesson." 

"Yes." 

The young man breathed a sigh of relief and disappeared without a trace. 

If he didn't fall, he would have to chop off a finger. If he fell, he might have to chop off his hand. 

The Thousand Soul Sect was vast and winding, and it was hard to tell where one was going. 

Xia Ge felt like she was having trouble breathing. 

Eyes were watching her from all sides, making her feel anxious and uneasy. 

She couldn't help but think back to before. 

When she asked Su Chan for the antidote, Su Chan didn't give her a hard time and gave it to her readily. 

Xia Ge didn't take it and just looked at her. 

"What? Are you afraid it's poisoned?" Su Chan's eyes shimmered as she walked up to her and took a bite out of the round antidote. "Is this... enough to put your mind at ease?" 

"Little girl, take a smaller bite or you might regret it later." 

Xia Ge snatched the antidote from her hand without saying a word and walked away. 

After a few steps, she turned around and walked back, her face expressionless. "Xiangsi." 

Su Chan smiled slightly. 

"Xiangsi, let's wait a bit longer."
Xia Ge frowned at her.

Su Chan said, "It's feeling sad now, thinking that you don't want it anymore."

Xiao Xiangsi was tied up in her sleeve by Blood Dyed Spring and Autumn, struggling wildly but unable to come out.

To outsiders, her sleeve was calm and peaceful.

Su Chan looked at Xia Ge's frowning face and Xia Ge said, "Do you think I will believe your nonsense?"

Su Chan slightly pressed down on her sleeve, unfazed. She raised her eyebrows and smiled softly, "Believe it or not, it's up to you."

Xia Ge clenched her fists slightly.

"Everyone feels sad when they are abandoned," Su Chan chuckled, "You should know that."

Xia Ge: "..."

"... You have a very good look in your eyes," Su Chan sighed, the smile on her lips gradually becoming ambiguous, "It's like you want to eat me."

Her arm gently hung on Xia Ge's neck, the rosy sleeve slipping down to reveal her snow-white arm, and Xiao Xiangsi, stained with blood, was hidden on the other side of her clothes. "But it's okay. Whatever Xia Xia wants to do to me, I won't resist at all."

The girl's eyes flowed with waves, her fragrance alluring and tempting.

Xia Ge took her arm expressionlessly and walked away.

Su Chan just smiled at her back.

"Don't say I didn't give you the antidote, Xia Xia."

Xia Ge ignored her.

The formation inside the Thousand Soul Sect was sealed, her teleportation array was ineffective, but fortunately, she had bought a teleportation stone from the system store and ran to Dan Peak at night. She had heard that Lingxi Peak was under martial law, especially the Heart Nurturing Hall, so she was cautious, but... her caution was all for naught as she encountered no obstacles along the way.

It was as if someone was helping her.

Xia Ge sneered. Besides Su Chan, who else would help her in this world?

So in the end, she didn't feed the antidote to her senior sister.
She was afraid it was poisoned.

Su Chan ate it and was fine, but who knows if Senior Sister will be fine after eating it?

She couldn't afford to take the risk.

When she came out, she saw Su Chan sitting bored under an unflowered white tree at the entrance of the Yangxin Palace. The deep night couldn't hide the stunning red dress of the young girl, with her white shoulders exposed unintentionally, and she propped up her chin and looked at her, with a faint smile at the corners of her eyes and eyebrows.

"You're out."

Xia Ge didn't look at her and turned to the other side.

Su Chan didn't mind and followed behind her with a smile.

One walked, and one followed.

Xia Ge suddenly felt annoyed as she walked.

It's not supposed to be like this.

The person who has been following her all the time is not this person.

She suddenly turned around, Su Chan didn't stop, and Xia Ge turned into her arms.

Su Chan's mouth curled up, and she touched her head. "So obedient."

Xia Ge pushed her away suddenly, feeling angry. "What are you doing here?"

Su Chan didn't mind. "I'm here to take you back."

Xia Ge said, "Get lost, don't act like you're at home."

Su Chan's eyebrows slightly furrowed, then she softened and asked, "Do you want me to leave?"

Xia Ge said, "Just leave quickly."

The person behind her disappeared.

Xia Ge breathed a sigh of relief.

She lowered her head and walked on the Dan Feng, looking at the grass and trees here, familiar and friendly.
She finally arrived at the study room where her senior sister often stayed. The cluster of embroidery ball flowers was fresh green, and the frangipani had not yet bloomed.

The sky turned dark, and it began to drizzle.

The door latch was tightly closed. She silently walked to the door and sat on the stone steps.

Her black belt was loose and had picked up some mud, but Zhenhun, feeling a bit disgusted, shone a faint light on it and cleaned off the dirt. He then extended the black belt and smacked Xia Ge's head, looking like he was frustrated but couldn't do anything about it.

Xia Ge hugged her knees and rested her head on them, letting him hit her.

The rain became heavier.

Zhenhun got tired of hitting her and stopped. The accumulated rainwater on the eaves flowed down, forming a thin line of rain.

After a while, Zhenhun's waist belt shook slightly and bent into an S shape, reaching out to catch the raindrops falling from the eaves.

A soft light shone from the belt, and the raindrops slid down the belt like a slide. Zhenhun twisted and turned the belt, enjoying himself.

Unlike Jianfeng, where people patrolled the mountain every night, there were hardly any disciples resting at Danfeng at this time.

Xia Ge looked up and watched for a while, not knowing what she was looking at.

A gentle white shadow flashed by.

Xia Ge stood up suddenly!

Zhenhun, who was catching rain, was startled by her movement. The raindrops, which had been playing like children under his gentle care, flew off the slippery belt.

Zhenhun: "#$%......"

Ignoring Zhenhun hitting her head with the belt, Xia Ge rushed into the rain curtain, "Senior Sister!!"

The rain became heavier.

Suddenly, a thunderbolt sounded in the dark night sky, and the pale lightning illuminated the outline of the trees. Then, a deafening roar followed. Xia Ge, who was too focused on Zhenhun's anger, forgot to activate the rain protection barrier. She was caught off guard when she suddenly rushed into the rain, and the cold rain soaked her entire body. The noble Zhenhun turned into a wet chicken in an instant.

Zhenhun: "$%......&"

Xia Ge rushed into the mountains of Danfeng.
This is the place where she has lived for a very long time.

Every plant and tree is astonishingly familiar to her.

She knows where the mulberries are, where the jujube trees are, where the flowers bloom first, and where the grapes are the sweetest.

But in this vast night, she feels a bit unfamiliar.

Because no matter how hard she looks, she cannot find the person she just saw.

All the familiarity suddenly loses its meaning.

Xia Ge suddenly realizes.

She ran very fast and chased very quickly, but in the end, besides being covered in wind and rain and fallen leaves, there was nothing else.

She leaned against a tree and took a deep breath, the light in her eyes slowly dimming.

Her senior sister is in the Yongxin Palace, how could she be here?

If she's okay... how could she not come to see her?

The system said, "You're too tired."

Xia Ge pulled her lips, but couldn't smile, "Maybe."

The strong wind blew the remaining leaves, scattered everywhere.

Xia Ge turned to leave, and a white figure mixed in with the fallen leaves, quietly approaching Xia Ge.

Little by little.

The Town Soul Belt on Xia Ge's waist became sensitive.

And just as the white figure was about to pounce on Xia Ge's head, she felt something was wrong and instinctively turned around.

Besides the swaying tree shadows behind her, there was nothing else.

Xia Ge frowned and turned around to continue walking.

The white figure was picked up by a slender and delicate hand just before it fell on Xia Ge's head.
The girl in the red dress lazily leaned on a branch, casually letting her perfectly curved little legs hang down, her snow-white feet with round toes. She twirled a struggling white piece of cloth in one hand, leaning on a black oiled paper umbrella with a round bone and paper umbrella surface, on which the red spider lilies bloomed brilliantly.

It was this paper umbrella that completely obscured Su Chan's presence from Xia Ge.

"Heh," Su Chan squinted and smiled. "You were so obedient before, haven't you learned your lesson yet?"

"But now, I can't tolerate your insolence."

The white cloth struggled angrily, then calmed down, as if negotiating something with Su Chan.

"Although I want her to come home soon," Su Chan curled her lips, "children are always playful."

The girl tilted her head slightly, looking at Xia Ge's departing figure, her brow gentle and affectionate. "I always have to indulge her."

Xia Ge's shadow gradually disappeared into the distance.

Su Chan's fingertips moved slightly, and a ball of red flames ignited. Just as the white cloth was about to be burned to ashes, a piercing scream rang out!

Su Chan's pupils contracted slightly! It was a diversionary tactic!

"That's...my...master."

The white cloth twisted and trembled, "Life, death, god, soul..."

"All of them...are mine!!"

"Tsk." Su Chan sneered coldly. "Just you?"

"You also forced me to..."

Su Chan's gaze turned cold, and the white cloth was instantly consumed by a sea of red lotus flames!

...

Rain fell drizzlingly, but Su Chan had no time to spare. She leaped and arrived at Xia Ge's location.

It was too late.

In the pitch-black forest, rain was blocked by a black barrier. Within the barrier, a girl dressed in black Town Soul clothing had lifeless eyes. She stared blankly at a snow-white robe, her gaze seeming both sad and happy. Finally, she trembled and carefully touched the hem of the robe.
"Stop!" Su Chan's hand floated slightly, and the sharp patterns on her vibrant blood-stained clothes burst open in an instant. The next moment, her spiritual energy surged, and countless blood-red vines bloomed out of nowhere, carrying sharp spiritual blades that could tear the barrier into millions of pieces!

In the moment the barrier shattered, Su Chan heard Xia Ge's soft whisper, "Senior Sister..."

As if someone had pressed the pause button, Su Chan's movements suddenly stopped.

The fallen red vines scattered all over the ground, slowly fading in the rain.

It was at this moment that Xia Ge's hand touched the curse.
