"Mm, good, I'll marry you." Gu Peijiu lowered her head and kissed her tears, following her words.

Xia Ge held her hand, feeling warm and smooth like warm jade.

After a while, she whispered, "...I'm not mad at you anymore."

Gu Peijiu was slightly startled.

"But about the past...you have to tell me everything one by one," Xia Ge lowered her head, "so I can forgive you."

Gu Peijiu hugged her and touched her head, chuckling softly, "My story is only for my wife to hear."

"No, you have to tell me now!" Xia Ge took her head out of the other's soft chest.

Gu Peijiu narrowed her eyes slightly, and under her long and thick eyelashes, her black eyes flowed with moonlight. "Oh?"

"If I don't forgive you, then...I won't want you anymore," Xia Ge pretended to be angry, with a resolute look on her face.

No one knew that her lips were almost bitten through.

Gu Peijiu reached out and straightened the little girl's head, and the white thumb, as fair as jade, gently pressed against her lips. The soft fingertip touched the temperature of her red lips, and it teased the girl's teeth that were biting her lower lip. She narrowed her eyes slightly, "Really don't want me anymore?"

Xia Ge lowered her head and didn't say anything.

How could she bear to not want her?

Gu Peijiu leaned against the girl's ear and bit it, saying, "If you don't want me, then I'll go..."

Her mouth was covered.

Xia Ge glanced at her, "...go where? To do what?"

Gu Peijiu blinked her eyes, with a hint of a smile at the corners of her eyes and eyebrows.

Xia Ge snorted and put her hand down.

Gu Peijiu then said leisurely, "Go with a grand procession, with ten miles of red decorations, and marry you home."
After a moment of silence, she said, "If you don't want to marry me, then I can only bring Madam home."

Xia Ge replied, "That's not fair to you, I can't do that."

After their argument, they picked up firewood and returned to where they had buried the goose wrapped in lotus leaves, and started a fire.

The warm sparks danced, and Xia Ge rested her head on Gu Peijiu's chest, feeling the softness and listening to her strong heartbeat, and the story that had been sealed in time.

"Why were you able to wait for someone for so long?"

When Xia Ge heard that the person behind her had been waiting for more than 500 years, her heart was filled with mixed emotions, which eventually turned into a lingering pain and ache. "I feel...it's not worth it at all."

Especially when that person was her own.

"Why isn't it worth it?" Gu Peijiu's hand rested on her small belly, feeling warm. She said, "In my eyes, there is nothing more worthwhile than Madam."

Her black eyes reflected the flickering sparks, and her voice was gentle. "After all, at that time..."

Let alone 500 years.

Even if it was 5,000 years or 50,000 years.

She would still wait forever.

No one would ever know.

When the person named Wu Dikui showed her the fragment and told her that that person might come back, it was like a person falling into an abyss seeing hope, or a glimmer of light shining in endless darkness, or an oasis in a dry desert. No one would know how fortunate she was at that moment.

In endless loneliness, there was the happiness of a dream.

As long as she waited patiently, everything would be fine.

As long as she waited, without asking for anything, the person she was waiting for would come back--

How lucky that was.

Gu Peijiu lowered her eyelashes slightly, concealing the warmth in her black eyes. "When I think of Madam coming back to me..."

"I just feel that compared to waiting, death and forgetting are really too scary."
As Xia Ge listened, there was no sweetness, only a dense heartache.

This person, had waited for her for so long.

She had never thought that there would be someone who could like her so much.

She had also never thought that she was worth someone's deep and unwavering love, and such a profound wait.

No matter who she was before, or who she is now.

Thinking of her previous self who asked Wu Di Gui why she wasn't angry, she suddenly felt like a real asshole.

She paused for a moment and whispered, "I will always be by your side from now on."

Her voice was very firm.

No matter to forgive or not.

She was really childish.

She leaned against his chest, looked up, and met Gu Peijiu's pitch-black eyes.

"So, don't always think...if something happens, you have to face it alone."

Gu Peijiu said, "Okay."

Xia Ge hesitated for a moment and said again, "Why did it become Dou Dou?"

Gu Peijiu said, "I calculated that Qin Shuang was you before, and after a fight with Huo Ming, the puppet's body and the Wen Qing sword were sealed in the Bai Meng Cave. The soul was severely damaged and temporarily inhabited the body of the little girl next to Qin Shuang who was about to starve to death."

The memory was fragmented, but she remembered...there was someone who used to call her Dou Dou.

So it became Dou Dou.

Xia Ge suddenly realized.

The scene of Nanming Village was vividly in her mind.

She thought of the girl covered in blood and her heart twisted in pain. She covered Gu Peijiu's hand on her small abdomen and bit her lip, "Then...what happened to the village after the demon tide?"

"After the demon tide, the body was devoured by the demons." Gu Peijiu paused and said, "Only the soul remained, and after encountering Huo Ming several times, it was sealed in the Bai Meng Cave by it."
Xia Ge was surprised, "Ah?"

"But then 'she' came," Gu Peijiu said.

"She?" Xia Ge asked, referring to Gu Peijiu's partner.

Gu Peijiu then told her about the reincarnation of the soul.

"Why did you have to split your soul?" Xia Ge asked, feeling distressed.

Gu Peijiu gently rested her chin on Xia Ge's head and whispered, "Like this..."

She didn't say anything more, just thinking to herself, and suddenly smiled.

Xia Ge suddenly felt touched.

Her senior sister was once just a puppet...she wanted to become a person like her.

But disaster was looming, and she had to protect her remnant soul. She couldn't simply be reborn without a second thought.

So, she had to split her soul and be reborn.

"I can't miss you," Gu Peijiu's voice was soft. "I've missed it once before, so all these years, I've told myself...I can't miss it again."

So, no matter what, she couldn't forget.

Even in her dreams, she repeatedly reminded herself, who couldn't remember anything, to remember that person - even if she couldn't remember, she had to think about it and protect her well.

Xia Ge's eyes turned slightly red, "You're really silly, it's not worth it."

Gu Peijiu said seriously, "As long as it's for my wife, it's worth it anywhere."

Xia Ge said, "I've never seen anyone as silly as you."

Gu Peijiu said, "Only silly for my wife to see."

Xia Ge's face turned slightly red, "I don't want to see it."

The flames danced, and under the starry sky, there was warmth.
When it came to the Soul Splitting and White Dream Caves, Xia Ge suddenly shuddered and asked, "When I obtained the Ghost Dragon Jade a long time ago... the person who saved me was you?"

She still remembered that when she went up the mountain to obtain the Ghost Dragon Jade to save Ye Ze, she encountered the Nine-Headed Snake and almost died there. However, she didn't die in the end, and didn't even have any injuries. She had always thought that encountering the Nine-Headed Snake was just a dream, but what she saw in the White Dream Cave...

It was the black-cloaked person who saved her.

Gu Peijiu answered softly, "Yes, it was me."

Pausing for a moment, she continued, "At that time, the Calamity was looking for your whereabouts. It knew that I might know where you were, so it was following me. I could only set up a barrier on you that could shield it, and I couldn't get too close to you either."

"That time in the White Dream Cave... you almost got discovered by it. It was very risky," Gu Peijiu said.

"Because the Soul Splitting's soul was unstable, two souls couldn't be too close to each other. Therefore, I couldn't get too close to Dan Feng either," Gu Peijiu paused and said, "But later on, when you went to the Black Market and the Calamity found out that it was me, it was unexpected."

"It was that time," Xia Ge suddenly realized.

It was the first time she went to the Black Market, the time she encountered the Calamity's persistent and haunting attire, and the time when her senior sister caught her in her female form...

Thinking of the event of becoming a child prostitute in Tian Du, Xia Ge's face flushed slightly.

Gu Peijiu touched her head, "It found your whereabouts, and I hindered it repeatedly. Later, it sealed me in the White Dream Cave."

Xia Ge's mood was a little low, "I didn't know any of this."

"There's nothing good to know," Gu Peijiu said, "If you knew, you wouldn't be happy."

Gu Peijiu's voice was calm, "If you're not happy, I'll be sad too."

"No..." Xia Ge shook her head, flipped over from Gu Peijiu's body, and pressed her shoulders, "Although I might feel troubled and distressed..."

"But as long as I'm with my senior sister," the night was pale, and the girl's voice was very quiet, "I won't be unhappy."

She said, "I can face anything."

She leaned over and hugged Gu Peijiu's snow-white neck, "As long as my senior sister is behind me, even if it's a mountain of knives and a sea of fire, I will still move forward step by step."

"I won't let my loved one be sad because of my mood..."
Gu Peijiu's pupils shrank slightly. "You..."

"I also want to tell my beloved," Xia Ge whispered in her ear, his eyes slightly red. "I have no dreams, no wishes, I have nothing."

"I want to tell her."

"I always thought that no one would like someone like me."

"I never asked for anyone's affection, nor did I want to ask for anyone's love."

"So, I never thought that there would be someone willing to wait for me for so long."

"Nor did I ever think that there would be someone always behind me."

The girl's voice sounded a little choked, "So... so..."

Her choked voice slowly became firm.

"So."

"I also want to stand in front of her."

"I also want to shield her from the wind and rain."

"I also want to protect her."

"I also want to offer her the stars and flowers."

"I also want to be her hero, by her side day and night."

Her hand gently held his, fingers intertwined. "I don't know how much I can like someone."

"But I know."

"Forever and ever."

"No matter what happens."

"I will never leave her."

"I swear."
"I will always believe in her."

"Love her forever."

"...I can like you to this extent."

In his eyes, the dancing flame flickered slightly.

Gu Peijiu blinked her eyes and tears rolled down her cheeks.

In the moment when the scorching tears fell, Gu Peijiu felt a little dazed.

So this is how it feels to cry.

In moments of sadness, pain, hopelessness, and having nothing...

There has never been a moment that could make her cry like this.

So this is what it feels like.

To be so happy.

She had been waiting for this moment for a very long time.

Like a wild dog barking at the stars, like a monkey reaching for the moon, or a bird without legs flying in vain in the thorns...

And after endless waiting, a beautiful shooting star fell into the wild dog's heart, the monkey caught the bright moonlight, and the footless bird found its cozy nest.

They rejoiced and cheered.

Gu Peijiu heard herself whisper softly.

"Mmm. Me too."

I am willing to offer you a thousand miles of flowers, countless stars.

Years will pass, only you will be my true love in my heart.
"...there are still many things I want to tell you."

They will be together forever.

As the past of a deity, it became the joy of Dou Dou, and in endless loneliness, there was someone who could wait for happiness.

They have an endless past and an infinite future.

"Let's get married, senior sister."

"Okay."

Under the starlight and moonlight, the two embraced tightly, their black and white clothes like an immortal painting.

From now on, there is no distinction between you and me.

Spring returns with geese, summer cicadas sing, and flowers bloom like brocade, with one kiss lasting forever.

"Senior sister, from now on I'll sell fake medicine and you collect the money, okay?"

"..."

"Don't you agree? Sob sob, you don't love me anymore..."

"..."

"Oh, by the way, selling aphrodisiacs seems to be more profitable..."

"...you can't go."

System: "The two of you are about to burn the duck..."

"Shut up! That's a goose!"

End of the story.

Author's note: Well, finally the ending.
Thank you all for accompanying me until now. I wrote continuously, and many things happened in between, and my mentality has also changed a lot. But I persisted until the end and gave everyone a relatively complete story.

Thank you all for your company. The extras will be posted gradually.

I'm shamelessly asking for your support for my new work...

After some calculation, I think the 10th is a good day, so the new work will probably start on the 10th. ◇
