夏无双 wasn't in a hurry. She supported her chin with one hand and placed the other hand in front of Gu Peijiu, letting her wrap the wound. The moon was clear, and the movements of the white-clad puppet were very gentle. Xia Wu Shuang was a little mesmerized, and after a while, she smiled and said, "Ah Jiu, it's a pity that you are such a good girl. If you were in an ordinary family..." She paused and continued, "Well, a girl as good as you wouldn't be in an ordinary family."

Gu Peijiu didn't say anything, and after wrapping Xia Wu Shuang's wound, she chopped a pile of bamboo and threw it in front of her with one hand. Xia Wu Shuang was speechless. Gu Peijiu said, "For such small things, it's better not to do them yourself."

Xia Wu Shuang said, "Doing it myself is meaningful."

The white-clad puppet didn't speak, and her black eyes looked at her. For some reason, Xia Wu Shuang was a little scared and guilty under her gaze, so she looked away.

Gu Peijiu withdrew her gaze and looked at the sword wrapped tightly in white cloth beside her, asking, "Do you want to make a scabbard for it?"

Xia Wu Shuang said, "The moonlight reflected by the sword at midnight hurts my eyes. I can't help but look at it, and then I can't sleep."

Xia Wu Shuang tried to put a good face on it and said, "How does that saying go...drunk and picking up a sword to look at it, dreaming...what was it again..."

Gu Peijiu said, "Dreaming of blowing the horn at the camp."

Xia Wu Shuang slapped her hand and said, "Yes, that's it."

Then she smiled awkwardly and said, "How did you know?"

Gu Peijiu said, "You taught it to Su Chan."

Xia Wu Shuang said, "Really? I don't remember."

Gu Peijiu changed the subject and said, "Don't do it if your hand is injured. I'll do it."

Xia Wu Shuang said, "Hey, but I have to do it myself."
"I am your leader," Gu Peijiu looked at her, his black eyes devoid of any emotion, "naturally, your hands are mine."

She picked up the knife that Xia Wushuang had used to cut bamboo earlier. Under the moonlight, her hand holding the knife looked as smooth as jade. Her voice was calm, "You can command the knife, so naturally, you can command me."

Xia Wushuang instinctively felt that something was wrong, "No..."

It wasn't like that.

Gu Peijiu had already picked up a piece of bamboo and started to carve it with delicate and gentle movements, much better than Xia Wushuang's technique.

After a moment of hesitation, Xia Wushuang finally spoke up, looking at the bamboo sheath taking shape, "It's not like that."

Gu Peijiu didn't look at her and continued carving the bamboo.

"Don't mess with me," Xia Wushuang said after watching for a while, "You're not like a knife."

Gu Peijiu said, "It's the same."

Xia Wushuang acted stubbornly, "If I say it's not the same, it's not the same."

Gu Peijiu paused for a moment, then said with understanding and tolerance, "Hmm, then it's not the same."

Xia Wushuang: "..."

The bamboo sword sheath was finally completed, and Gu Peijiu carefully polished the edges with sandpaper before handing it to her.

Xia Wushuang took the sheath, feeling the smoothness of the bamboo and the faint reflection of light under the moonlight.

She murmured, "I don't know if it's an illusion... Ajiu, I always feel like only you know what I want."

Gu Peijiu looked up at her. The girl held the sheath, looking at her with black eyes full of moonlight.

Gu Peijiu's face showed no expression.

Xia Wushuang sighed and smiled self-deprecatingly, "Why am I saying all this?"

"Ajiu, can you help me fold some bamboo? I want to make a few chairs."

Gu Peijiu bent down and went to work.

When she came back with a stack of bamboo, she saw Xia Wushuang squatting in front of a tree, staring at the cold sword in her hand. There were faint traces of blood on her freshly bandaged hand.
She walked over with the bamboo in her arms and swept her gaze over the bamboo sheath that had been placed aside and the small knife that had been casually thrown aside.

On the bamboo sheath, two crooked characters were carved.

【Ask Love】.

Gu Peijiu's gaze paused, then turned back to the white cloth stained with the girl's blood.

It seemed that the characters were carved with a knife, accidentally tearing the wound and causing it to bleed again.

The moonlit sword reflected a lonely cold light on the girl's cheek.

The falling flowers were intentional, but the flowing water was heartless.

Hearing a noise nearby, Xia Wushuang finally snapped out of her trance. "Ah, you're back."

Gu Peijiu put down the bamboo and picked up the knife, silently shaving the bamboo, lost in thought.

Even if she took off the gorgeous sword sheath, she would always be the princess in her heart.

Qianhun Sect, night, the Priest's Hall.

Xia Ge was startled. "..."

But he quickly realized who was behind him.

It had been a long time since they had seen each other.

Actually, it wasn't that long.

It's just that there have been too many things happening recently, and this "long time no see" really has a taste of the past.

"Brother, have you been happy these days?" The girl said, "You must be unhappy."

The feeling of skin touching was very real.

Xia Ge felt a little goosebumps. "If you don't get so close, I might be a little happier."
"Brother, what are you afraid of?" The young girl leaned against his back. "It's just an illusion. Can't we dream a little?"

"No, you can't," Xia Ge said firmly.

Chu Yi let go of his arm and took two steps back, feeling a little aggrieved. "Okay."

Xia Ge released his grip on the spirit suppressing talisman and turned around to look at her.

The young girl was wearing a light blue dress, her shoulders bare, and the hem of her dress trailing on the ground. In the moonlight, her figure was somewhat hazy, but she still had a faint breath. Even when their skin touched, there was a delicate and warm sensation.

For a moment, Xia Ge couldn't tell if it was real or an illusion.

"My clothes can create illusions," Chu Yi explained when she saw Xia Ge's confusion. "Others see me as a butterfly, but you see me as myself."

Xia Ge understood what she meant. In other words, others would see a dead leaf butterfly, but she would see Chu Yi.

Because every sense was deceived, the illusion became very real.

Now that she understood the principle, Xia Ge didn't care much anymore. "What do you want from me?"

Chu Yi just looked at her, smiling without saying a word.

After being stared at for a while, Xia Ge couldn't help but think of what had happened before and felt a little uneasy.

"If you have something to say, just say it. If not, leave," she said in a slightly impatient tone.

Chu Yi sounded a little aggrieved as she spoke. "It's been a long time since I've seen Brother. Can't I just look at you more?"

Xia Ge remained silent.

"If you have nothing else to do, you should leave quickly. If Su Chan sees you, there won't be any good consequences," Xia Ge warned.

Chu Yi said, "It's okay, I'm not afraid of her."

Xia Ge remained silent.

"I don't believe a word of the rumors outside," she said finally.
She said, "I know my brother wouldn't do that."

Xia Ge interrupted, "But you're saying all this now--"

"But does my brother have nothing he wants to do?" Chu Yi suddenly asked.

Xia Ge was taken aback, and her heart skipped a beat.

"I know my brother is trapped in this place," Chu Yi walked over, her light blue dress swaying on the ground without leaving a trace.

Her voice was gentle, "I can help my brother do what he wants to do."

This was an illusion that Chu Yi gave to Xia Ge alone.

"I don't have...anything I want to do," Xia Ge said.

...That's not true.

There were many things she wanted to do, but she didn't know how to do them.

The sleeping face of her senior sister flashed through her mind, as did Lady Ye's gentle face and the young man's vicious curse.

"You can come with me," Chu Yi saw Xia Ge's hesitation and spoke softly, "I will protect you and clear your name. I know what to do...and when everything is over, you can go anywhere you want."

Xia Ge pursed her lips.

She wasn't afraid of the world's condemnation, but she really didn't want to be stuck in this corner.

But she also didn't want to go with Chu Yi.

Noticing Xia Ge's reluctance, Chu Yi said, "But if you stay here, you won't be able to do anything."

Xia Ge looked at her.

Chu Yi looked at her, her smile shallow, "Wouldn't my brother be unwilling to accept this?"

Xia Ge said, "You don't need to provoke me."

"People say that my brother summons evil spirits and harms his fellow disciples," Chu Yi said softly, "I know my brother is not like that. Of course, I also know that my brother doesn't care about what outsiders say."
Xia Ge looked at her.

"But, I don't think Brother knows," Chu Yi said. "After the battle at the Evil Spirit Mountain, the seal inside was torn apart, and there are endless troubles. Now, evil spirits are rampant and the people are struggling to survive."

Xia Ge's pupils shrank. "Impossible!"

She personally repaired the seal at the Evil Spirit Mountain! As long as the remnant evil spirits that escaped from there were eliminated, it would be absolutely--

"Brother, besides unpredictable human hearts, there is nothing impossible in this world," Chu Yi said, looking at her. "Now, all the blame is on you."

Xia Ge's mood suddenly became complicated.

"Perhaps Brother doesn't care," Chu Yi's gaze became a little chilly. "But every time I hear a word, I can't help but want to tear their mouths apart and make them understand what it means to be better off dead."

"You don't have to say these things in front of me," Xia Ge said.

"...But doesn't Brother hate Su Chan?" Chu Yi asked. "Clearly, everything was done by her, and she still let rumors and insults spread about you. Doesn't Brother hate her?"

"I don't have the mood for that," Xia Ge said. Hating someone is too tiring. Saying you hate them is too simple.

"Brother is still so soft-hearted," Chu Yi laughed lightly. "It doesn't matter, because...Brother, you definitely have something you want to do now."

The evil spirits at the Evil Spirit Mountain have emerged, whether it's because of anxiety or something else--Xia Ge will definitely not sit idly by.

Xia Ge pursed her lips and looked at her. "...Why do you have to push me like this?"

"I'm not pushing you," Chu Yi said. "I just don't like it."

"Brother is being bullied like this, and yet you keep making concessions," Chu Yi gently touched Xia Ge's cheek with her hand, her eyes shining slightly. "After all, you are sharp and gentle at the same time. That's who you are."

"..."

= =

When Su Chan found out that Xia Ge had slipped away, she wasn't very anxious.

The northern sky was a boundless deep blue, without a single cloud.
Qin Yue stood beside Su Chan, looking worried.

No one who escaped from the Demon Cult and was caught ever had a good ending.

Even though Xia Ge was a captive, she still held the position of a junior priestess. The Thousand Soul Cult was strict in its hierarchy, and deviating from duty without the order of the cult leader was a serious offense.

The cult leader's temple was being rebuilt, and Su Chan was lying peacefully in the pear garden, drinking hot tea while occasionally watching the falling pear blossoms.

Qin Yue lowered her head, thinking of an excuse to absolve Xia Ge, "Junior Priestess Xia must have just been mischievous."

Su Chan smiled slightly, looking at the deep blue sky, "That's not true. It's not mischief."

Qin Yue was taken aback.

"She just found a reason to leave," Su Chan sipped her tea, and her long eyelashes cast fine shadows in her eyes, "a very good reason to convince herself."

"A reason?" Qin Yue asked, puzzled.

Did she need a reason?

"She has many reasons," Su Chan slowly said, "but none of them can convince herself."

"After all, the person she wants to save, the antidote, is only in my hands." Su Chan smiled with narrowed eyes, "She's not stupid, she knows I won't give her the real one."

Qin Yue: "..."

"After hating someone for so many years, how could she live on?" Su Chan licked her lips, her autumn eyes faintly cold, "Such hatred is too shallow."

Then she looked at Qin Yue with a smile, "What do you think?"

Qin Yue: "The cult leader... is wise."

Su Chan said, "She knows it's fake, but she has no choice but to stay in this corner, trying to come up with ways to deal with me. It's really cute."
Qin Yue: "..."

"After seeing Mrs. Ye, she started struggling again. She ran over to me and wanted me to stop her - I stopped her and let her have her way, but she's still not satisfied. What else can I do?" Su Chan squinted his eyes, "It's really contradictory."

Qin Yue said: "You shouldn't have let her see Mrs. Ye."

Su Chan said: "But she left me there to be blown by the wind all night. I was also sad."

Qin Yue: "..."
