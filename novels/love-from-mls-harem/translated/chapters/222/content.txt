Translation:

Chang'an.

Snowflakes fell gently, and several plum blossoms were in full bloom in the East Palace.

Although her title had changed, Chu Shi was still temporarily residing in the East Palace as she had not yet been officially crowned.

Chu Shi wore a dark royal robe and held a wolf hair brush dipped in cinnabar ink. On the soft paper, several beautiful peach blossoms were drawn. The young girl's black hair was lightly tied up, and she held a branch of peach blossom, as if looking back with a sly smile.

Chu Shi was sketching the beautiful peach color on the girl's head with the brush, but for some reason, she couldn't continue.

The head eunuch next to her said cautiously, "Your Majesty, the coronation ceremony is in three days. Would you like to take a break?"

Chu Shi's long eyelashes drooped, and her voice was faint, "It's fine."

At this moment, a young eunuch rushed over and knelt down to report, "Your Majesty, Prince Chu Huai is waiting to see you in the adjacent study room."

Chu Shi looked at the half-drawn painting and did not move.

The head eunuch next to her said politely, "I will keep an eye on it for you, Your Majesty. You should go first."

Only then did Chu Shi put down the brush and leave slowly.

After the people left, the head eunuch breathed a sigh of relief and stretched his neck to look at the painting for a while. Suddenly, he slapped his forehead and said, "Isn't this General Xia?"

The young eunuch who was reporting the news was still kneeling on the ground and looked up carefully at the head eunuch. The head eunuch knew he had spoken out of turn and glared at him, "Get out of here quickly."

The higher the rank, the more power they had. The young eunuch quickly retreated.

The head eunuch looked at the painting with some worry. Although Chu Shi had conquered the world, she still had reservations about Prince Chu Huai due to the General Xia incident. However, she had been sitting in the deep palace for a long time, and the officials' reports were mostly about agriculture and military affairs. The rumors about General Xia had been suppressed by Prince Chu Huai. If the Emperor found out...it would be a big fury.

The head eunuch shrunk his head and decided to pretend he didn't know...

"What brings my uncle here in person?" Chu Shi had moved to the study room. Prince Chu Huai was indeed standing at the door with his head bowed. Chu Shi let him in and spoke cordially, but her voice was still faint.

Prince Chu Huai knew that although Chu Shi had conquered the world, there was still some distance between them due to the General Xia incident. However, he did not care and said, "Your Majesty, tomorrow is the coronation ceremony, and Chang'an is under martial law. However, there is still some unrest in the east recently..."

Chu Shi raised her eyebrows, "Oh?"
King Chu Huai said, "I have ordered Changan to be on high alert. Your Majesty, don't worry too much. Please send troops after your coronation to capture them and prevent them from disturbing the peace of the people..."

Chu Shi replied with a "Hmm, understood."

King Chu Huai wanted to say something more, but Chu Shi interrupted, "Uncle, will General Xia come to my coronation ceremony in three days?"

King Chu Huai was momentarily speechless, but his face remained unchanged. "Hasn't Your Majesty already sent an invitation? If he doesn't come, it would be a violation of the imperial edict... I'm sure General Xia won't break his promise."

Chu Shi walked to the table and picked up a brush. "And what about the puppet soldiers under General Xia's command? It's time to reward them based on their merits. I've been thinking about it these past few days and have decided..."

King Chu Huai cautioned, "Your Majesty, please think twice. Puppets are not human beings. If we reward thirty thousand puppets based on their merits... the national treasury is already tight..."

Chu Shi looked at King Chu Huai with a calm and composed gaze, but there was an inexplicable chill in her eyes. "What about the puppets? They were also citizens of Chu before they became puppets. Now, they are even more brave and fierce than other soldiers in battle. They can conquer a barbarian country overnight. If they help me establish a prosperous country, why can't I reward them based on their merits?"

"I not only want to reward them, but also heavily reward them!"

King Chu Huai looked at Chu Shi, the young girl who was once carefree and now transformed through the iron and blood of the battlefield. Her eyes were filled with extraordinary determination and resolution. She neither blindly trusted nor ignored advice. It wouldn't be long before she would be beyond his control and become a worthy ruler.

As a courtier, he wished for a wise monarch who governed diligently and loved the people. However, seeing the carefree girl of the past abandon everything and step on the bones of the dead to reach her current position...

For a moment, King Chu Huai didn't know whether he felt gratified or disappointed.

He lowered his head and said, "As you wish."

However, deep down in his heart, he couldn't let go of that person.

When King Chu Huai left the Eastern Palace, the snow outside had grown heavier. A servant held an umbrella for him while his advisers walked beside him.

"...Spread my orders," King Chu Huai looked at the snow, "Don't suppress news about General Xia anymore."

The advisers looked at each other, uncertain. "This..."

One of them said, "My lord, this may not be appropriate. If Your Majesty finds out, he may hold a grudge against you."

King Chu Huai remained silent, sighed lightly, and left with a wave of his sleeve.

The day of Chu King's ascension was getting closer and closer.

It had been half a month since Xia Wushuang's "public speech" at the Lingxi Peak.

Xia Wushuang sat with her legs hugged, looking melancholic.

The evil spirits were rampant and the things the old priest had said had to be done, otherwise more people would suffer. The soulless puppet soldiers were of little use, and the victims' families would not dig up their loved ones from their graves for her.

The only solution now was to build the Soul Mountain, as the old priest had suggested.

Xia Wushuang took out the red talisman from her sleeve, her expression heavy.

But Gu Peijiu had been watching her closely lately. She knew Xia Wushuang had no ill intentions, but she had to find a way to escape.

She was being held in a courtyard, and the barrier Gu Peijiu had set up was very strong. She had thrown two earth pearls, but they seemed to have no effect. She had to think of another way...

Suddenly, there was a loud noise!

Xia Wushuang instinctively looked outside and heard Su Chan's gentle laughter.

Su Chan!

Xia Wushuang was overjoyed. This was a good opportunity! Maybe she could escape!

"Long time no see," Su Chan said.

Gu Peijiu's voice was calm. "I didn't expect you to find your way here."

Su Chan didn't waste any words and broke the barrier with a wave of her hand. Her red dress was stunning, and her eyes were mesmerizing. "The King of Chu has sent an invitation to General Xia. Of course, I had to come and bother you."

Gu Peijiu's jade finger brushed over her flute. "But Lingxi's Xia Wushuang has been locked up by me. She may never leave this place in her lifetime."

Su Chan said, "That's not up to you!"

The two outside didn't waste any more words and immediately started fighting. Xia Wushuang tried to escape but was blocked by the barrier at the door!

Xia Wushuang gritted her teeth and looked around. It seemed that Qingqing Sword had some problems before and was taken away by Gu Peijiu. With the chaos outside, it was probably used as a weapon by her.

"Yo yo..."

The chaotic sounds outside gradually faded away. Gu Peijiu seemed to be afraid of being implicated or wanted to lead Su Chan away. The two fought farther and farther away, and the sound of the explosion grew smaller and smaller. In its place was a somewhat familiar deer cry.
The barrier at the entrance slowly dissipated. A wooden door was pushed open by a hoof, and the first thing that poked in was a deer antler, followed by two pairs of watery eyes. The two deer squeezed their heads in, and upon seeing her, their eyes lit up with joy.

Xia Wushuang was moved to tears: "Holy crap, you guys actually broke the barrier - no, you guys actually found me!"

"Yo yo~"

Without hesitation, Xia Wushuang pushed the two deer out, not even bothering to pack her things. As soon as she left the barrier, she took out a teleportation stone and left with the two deer.

Gu Peiju's expression changed slightly as she fought with Su Chan. All the puppets immediately stood in front of her in a reckless manner, blocking Su Chan's intense attacks. Just as she was about to withdraw, Su Chan teleported to her and sneered, "Oh, where is White Bone going?"

Gu Peiju's eyes were cold. "Get out of my way."

Su Chan smirked. "What's the rush? You're so happy to make Wushuang yours by any means necessary, aren't you?"

Gu Peiju said, "I'm not you."

Of course, Su Chan knew why Gu Peiju had locked up Xia Wushuang, but she still said it. She had previously confused Gu Peiju's thoughts, and now the lost deer should be able to take Xia Wushuang away.

"I told you to get out of my way!"

Feeling the barrier change, Gu Peiju's expression changed slightly. She calculated that Xia Wushuang was getting farther and farther away from her. Her voice was as cold as ice, "Su Chan, you know she can't go anywhere!"

Su Chan smiled slightly. "Why can't she go anywhere? Didn't she always want to see her princess ascend to the throne when the King of Chu was crowned? Let her go and see what she can do."

See the King of Chu ascend to the throne? If a disaster occurred, not only would he not be crowned, but the entire Chang'an would not be enough for it to kill!

Gu Peiju said coldly, "Are you doing this on purpose?!"

"That's a bit heavy," Su Chan said casually. "I'm just helping Wushuang fulfill her wish."

Gu Peiju's voice was icy. "I said she can't go anywhere."

"What are you afraid of? ... Are you afraid she'll slaughter Chang'an?" Su Chan raised her eyes and asked knowingly.

Gu Peiju's hand rested on the Wenqing Sword at her waist.

Su Chan said, "Even if she destroys the entire Chang'an, what can you do? Back then, you caused her so much harm. This is the King of Chu's just punishment!"
At the end, her words were filled with bitterness, it seemed like she had held a grudge against the Chu King for a long time.

"I don't care who deserves punishment," Wenqing Sword slowly unsheathed from its scabbard, Gu Peijiu's eyes were so dark they couldn't see any light, "but no one can make her do something she doesn't want to do."

Not even herself.

In the next moment!

A snow-white sword light suddenly appeared from the scabbard, as if it could destroy everything, covered in frost and snow!

That was divine light.

Su Chan's pupils slightly contracted, Blood Stained Spring and Autumn shone with a dazzling red light, forming a blood-red barrier to block the sword light!

"Boom!"

The strong spiritual light almost made the world tremble, the sky was covered with dark clouds, lightning flashed, spherical lightning and thunderous sounds were rolling endlessly, it seemed like it was going to attract the heavenly punishment!

That sword light was truly powerful, tearing through the barrier, Su Chan avoided its sharpness, but still stood firmly in front of Gu Peijiu, her red sleeves fluttering, even under the flashing of the heavenly punishment, she did not avoid it at all, as if she was a roadblock.

"Heh." Su Chan sneered, "You can't stop her from doing what she wants, even with you."

After escaping, Xia Wushuang calculated the days and found out that it was only three or four days before the Chu King's coronation. Thanks to the convenience of the teleportation stone, Xia Wushuang did not rush to go, bringing two deer to look for a high mountain where Zhong Lingyu Xiu lived.

She really found a spiritual vein.

There were not many cultivators in the Wind and Moon Continent, nor were there so many chaotic sects that came later, so as long as one had the intention, they could find some good mountains to practice in.

After finding it, Xia Wushuang didn't have time to ask the Department of Land and Resources, and immediately used her spiritual power to claim the mountain as her own - drawing a huge circle around the mountain range of ten thousand miles.

Of course, it was impossible for her to draw it herself, but as the best puppet master in the Wind and Moon Continent - although she no longer had a leader, it was still not a problem to get a few temporary workers to draw a circle for herself. After spending more than a day, she finally marked out this huge spiritual mountain range.

The mountain range stretched for thousands of miles, and Xia Wushuang directly made a double-S puppet and lent all her spiritual power to it, allowing it to forcefully dig a basin in the middle, leaving a small mountain in the center. Then, she drew a large-scale gathering spirit array around the small mountain and dug a cave from the small mountain, stacking arrays, and finally pressed the red talisman on top.

When she was almost done, Xia Wushuang was almost exhausted. She was like a diligent miner, covered in dirt and dust. The small puppet next to her tenderly wiped her sweat, but was waved away by her. She squatted in the mountain cave dug out by the puppet, feeling lonely for the first time.

...Ajie's embrace was warm.
She thought.

But staying there.

Every day seemed to be haunted by evil spirits.

Being tortured by conscience and guilt day and night, it was really too painful.

Two deer came over, one nudging its head into her arms, the other stretching its neck and licking her cheek.

As if comforting her.

Xia Wushuang rallied.

The old priest gave her a method to summon all the evil spirits, and the mountain was almost ready, but she heard Su Chan say that King Chu had given her an invitation before...

Let's go there.

Xia Wushuang thought, meet Chu Shi for the last time, then summon the evil spirits and seal them up, and then figure out the rest.
