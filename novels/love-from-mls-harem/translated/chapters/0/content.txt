Title: Affection from the Male Lead's Harem [Transmigration]

Author: Chu Qimo

Synopsis:

After transmigrating into a harem novel with a game upgrade system, Xia Ge felt suffocated.

After careful consideration, Xia Ge, who knew the plot inside out, decided to cling onto the male lead's thick thigh.

And then, she provoked him.

Xia Ge: "I really didn't mean it, OTZ."

Male lead (drawing his sword): "Heh."

===

Serious and traditional senior sister (pondering): "I think I might have fallen for you."

Xia Ge: "...Please don't, I'm scared."

===

Hot-tempered assassin girl: "I think you're pretty good-looking!"

Xia Ge: "Thank you, you're also good-looking _(:3」∠)_, but please just look and don't touch." (Despair.jpg)

===

Demon sect enchantress: "Do you want to die, or do you want to marry me?"

Xia Ge: "I want to go home, TAT."

Later, Xia Ge thought about it and felt that she was not seducing the male lead's harem.

Rather, it was the male lead's harem that was seducing her. (Crying)

===

"Xia Ge, listen, from now on, I am your army of thousands and your invincible world."

Review:

Xia Ge transmigrated into a novel and initially planned to live a mediocre life under the protection of the system. However, under the "favor" of the cold senior sister, the noble lady of Chu family, the blind second miss of Chu family, and the enchantress of the demon sect, unexpected events kept happening, making her suffer. The male lead, who had a grudge against the annihilated sect, the dream in the Nanke mountain, the curse of the heavenly way, the brutal ghost tide, and the seemingly free and easy Xia Ge, all had their own secrets. As the entanglement of their past and present gradually revealed, there seemed to be unusual secrets behind the seemingly simple transmigration story... The writing style of this novel is delicate, the language is fluent and vivid, the characters are vivid and clear, the protagonist is humorous and funny, and the "harem" members have different personalities. The plot is full of imagination, with humorous and funny elements in the early stage, and delicate character entanglements in the later stage, with a deep love story and a touch of humor.
