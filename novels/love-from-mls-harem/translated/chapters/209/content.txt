"So... I'm really jealous," Chu Yiman said casually, "I also want you to become someone like me."

Chu Yi seemed to be talking about the past in a casual manner. "I knew what my sister wanted when she went to Jianfeng, so I went to Jianfeng too."

"My sister wanted to become the leader of Jianfeng's spirit asking, to become Jianfeng's true disciple - isn't that something to yearn for?"

"... My sister must have thought it was a place where heroes emerged." Chu Yiman chuckled. "So when she saw the people of Jianfeng bullying the weak, she must have been angry too, right?"

Chu Yao: "..."

"But my sister definitely didn't know..."

"I was the one who made them do it." Chu Yiman's voice was shallow. "As long as I could shatter my sister's dream... as long as I could destroy you."

At first, her voice was sweet, but then it turned gloomy. "I, Chu Yiman, can do anything."

Xia Ge listened in silence. The sun had already set, and darkness covered half of the sky.

She suddenly remembered her first meeting with Chu Yiman at Danfeng.

The girl in blue and white sword clothes looked indifferent, letting Jianfeng's disciples seriously injure Mao Qing.

Xia Ge thought, the world... is really too dark.

But it was also strangely ethereal.

The system said melancholically, "I don't think she necessarily thinks that way."

Xia Ge smiled and said, "...I think so too."

The little butterfly who held a knife and said seriously that she would protect her.

She must still be alive.

But it was too painful.

Chu Yao paused and said, "No wonder why there were suddenly so many people like that after you came."

She said, "It's very sad for you to be like this."

Chu Yiman chuckled lightly, "Anyway, since the moment I opened my eyes, I was already in the abyss."
She said, "Since you didn't pull me up back then, I had no choice but to...pull you down."

"Do you remember what I said to you back then on Jianfeng?" Chu Yi continued when Chu Yao remained silent. "I said that one day, I would tear off that layer of pride of yours and see the true face of the arrogant genius, torn apart and in agony."

Chu Yao replied calmly, "As long as I am alive, that day will never come."

Their conversation was long, and Xia Ge waiting on the tree was getting a headache. The grudges between the Chu sisters were difficult to resolve - one was too proud to let go, while the other held a long-standing resentment.

But Xia Ge knew that despite her harsh words, Chu Yao still cared for her sister.

She couldn't describe the feeling, but Xia Ge had a strong intuition.

This back-and-forth was getting them nowhere.

"...," the two continued to argue, with Chu Yi launching attacks such as "I hope you're unhappy forever" and "Your future will be miserable," while Chu Yao responded nonchalantly with "That's meaningless," "Whatever you say," "Love me or leave me," and other indifferent replies.

Xia Ge thought to herself, "This is actually kind of funny if you listen closely."

Finally, Chu Yi seemed to tire of the argument and said with a half-smile, "I know my sister won't go against our father's wishes."

Pausing for a moment, she added, "I look forward to seeing my sister in her wedding dress."

Xia Ge thought, "That's a bit cruel," and according to the Chu family's messed up traditions, the translation would probably be...

"I look forward to seeing my sister give up all her dreams."

...Wait, traditions?

Xia Ge was shocked when she realized that Chu Zhan had already passed away.

Her first reaction was to look around, but within a radius of ten miles, she had not seen anything white since she entered the area, except for the well-protected, pristine magnolia flowers.

"Wait, her father... isn't he supposed to observe a three-year mourning period after his death?!" Xia Ge exclaimed in disbelief. "Chu Yao can't get married!"

The system replied, "The Fengyue Continent doesn't ignore this fact, but rules are rules, and people are people..."
So, basically, it's like this: in the Chang family, or under the operation of Chu Yi, the marriage is going to happen. But because the former head of the family has passed away, it's not appropriate to make too much fuss. However, they did remove the mourning decorations such as white cloth.

"..."

Xia Ge was speechless. "They combine the wedding and funeral together. The Chu family is really something else. Wait, who is the current head of the Chu family? They are so unreliable... no, it's not just unreliable, it's despicable. How could she even think of such a thing?"

The system's voice was cold. "Chu Zhan only has two daughters. Guess who they are?"

Xia Ge thought for a moment and suddenly realized that what Chu Yi had said earlier made sense. She could tell that Chu Yi just wanted to take back what was hers and seek revenge on Chu Yao. Whether she really wanted that thing or not was not important. And the Chu family was the "thing" that belonged to her but was taken away.

Therefore, only a head of the family who had nothing to lose and was full of hatred would not care if her decision would bring shame to the family. Chu Yi finished speaking and came out. Xia Ge quickly took another hidden breath pill and crouched on the tree branch, pretending to be a branch.

A girl in a blue dress came out alone. It was already dark, and there were no stars or moon in the sky.

Xia Ge watched her leave alone. The girl's back was straight, and she seemed a bit lonely.

The system said, "I think she might need some comfort."

Xia Ge said, "Actually, I think she has been wanting to say those things to Chu Yao for a long time."

The system said, "Of course, if you really hate someone, you would want to say the most vicious things to them... It's the kind of feeling where you're happy when they're unhappy."

Xia Ge muttered, "I'm definitely not like that."

She paused and said, "Actually, I don't know if it's just my imagination, but earlier, Chu Yao... seemed to be comforting her the whole time?"

The system was confused. "??? How did you figure that out?"

Xia Ge said, "If anyone else dared to talk to Chu Yao like that, she would have twisted their necks... She wouldn't back down like that."
System: "It could also be that she was rejected by someone and became disheartened. Plus, Chu Yi is her younger sister."

This time, Xia Ge was very sure: "The former is impossible, and as you said, she's her younger sister."

So, it's not that she doesn't care.

Chu Yi left, and before Xia Ge could react, Chu Yao quickly came out.

The girl was dressed in a simple white shirt, as if she had just taken a bath. She wore wooden clogs, and her black hair was slightly damp. She breathed out lightly, her light brown almond eyes showing no emotion.

Xia Ge moved slightly, and a tender leaf fell from the phoenix tree.

Chu Yao raised her head and looked in her direction.

Xia Ge stuck her head out from the tree and awkwardly smiled at her. "Hi..."

Chu Yao widened her eyes and seemed stunned for a while. "You...?"

"I heard that you're getting married. Listen to me, you absolutely can't marry those people from the Chang family. They're not good people..." Xia Ge said, but as she continued to speak and saw that Chu Yao was still looking at her, she didn't know why, but she felt embarrassed and closed her mouth.

Chu Yao looked at her with a slightly curved eye and a hint of her tiger teeth showing. "I'm happy that you came to see me."

Xia Ge pondered her words, but suddenly felt that nothing she said was right.

Xia Ge smiled wryly and thought that she was already very awkward. Being a little more awkward wouldn't make much of a difference.

It was dark and windy, and everything seemed ambiguous.

Finally, Xia Ge said, "I don't want to see you jump into a fire pit."

"I know what you mean," Chu Yao said. "I can't leave with you, but I'm still happy that you came."

Xia Ge was surprised. "Why can't you...?"

But soon she fell silent. Just because Chu Yi didn't care about the family didn't mean that Chu Yao didn't care either.

She seemed carefree and reckless, but Xia Ge knew that Chu Yao had always been a responsible person.

Perhaps coming to the Demon Sect to find her was the most outrageous thing she had ever done.

The two of them silently looked at each other.
After a moment of silence, Xia Ge heard herself say, "I can't convince myself."

Xia Ge looked at her seriously and said, "I have always considered you as an important friend, someone I can drink and chat with, and even exchange letters with after we part... It has been three years since we separated, and I don't know what you're thinking, nor can I give you a response. I'm sorry."

"But it's precisely because of this that I won't just watch you..."

Chu Yao looked at her and smiled, "I know."

She paused and asked, "Did you see the peach blossom?"

Xia Ge was slightly startled, but quickly realized that Chu Yao was probably referring to the peach blossoms in the imperial garden.

She hesitated and nodded, "Yes, I saw them."

She didn't know why Chu Yao was asking this at such a critical moment.

Chu Yao smiled, her light brown almond-shaped eyes shining slightly, "Are they beautiful?"

Xia Ge said, "They're beautiful."

Chu Yao said, "I invited you to see the peach blossoms several times, but you refused. I didn't expect you to see them like this."

She said this with a smile, and it didn't seem to be anything sad.

Xia Ge panicked, "You're not going to marry into the Chang family!"

Chu Yao just looked at her and said, "Cherish the person you like."

- Just like I cherish you.

This statement sounded like a farewell, as if they would never see each other again. Xia Ge was stunned and a little at a loss.

Chu Yao said, "You've seen the peach blossoms, and I have no regrets. So... go back."

Xia Ge saw a butterfly in Chu Yao's clothes flying over from afar, probably because it had noticed that something was wrong here and came to investigate. Xia Ge gritted her teeth, left a sentence "I won't give up," and left.

Chu Yao watched the corner of the girl's clothes disappear behind the wall, and lowered her head slightly.

...Why did I come?

She had thought before that marrying an irrelevant person wasn't a big deal.
As soon as you arrived, why did she waver?

Chuyao laughed at herself. Chuyao, oh Chuyao, your character is just like that.

There is nothing to be proud of.

The night was deep.

When Xiage slipped away, she accidentally stepped on a tile, alarming the people of the Chu family.

"Thief!"

For a moment, the Chu family was brightly lit, and Xiage clearly felt that several people were chasing after her. Thinking that she had gained nothing and had been discovered, her mood suddenly became irritable. And in that instant, the black hem of the girl's clothing flickered with a white light in the night.

The pattern of the amaryllis slowly spread from that white corner...

Suddenly, the system said, "Hey, do you have anything happy to think about?"

Xiage inexplicably said, "No, I can't think of anything now."

The system sounded anxious, "Hey, then let me tell you a joke. Once upon a time, there was a mountain..."

It was useless.

The system's voice was drowned out in a hallucinatory noise.

As Xiage was being pursued by the Chu family guards, the person who had been running in front suddenly stopped, and the guards also stopped their footsteps, warily watching her as they slowly approached.

Someone whispered, "Look at that person's clothes, they're so strange. It clearly looked like night clothes just now, but now..."

Half black, half white.

Xiage stood still, her left eye blood red, her right eye pitch black. She pressed her chest, her memory suddenly confused, her mind blank!

The desire to kill...

Her pitch-black right eye gradually turned blood-red. She turned her head, her figure like lightning, and tore into the guard's vital points!

The white hem of her clothing blossomed into a blood-red amaryllis in the night, but the next moment, it plunged into a gentle embrace!

A delicate sandalwood fragrance diffused.
Accompanied by a soft sigh, the guards of the Chu family only saw a flash of white before everything went black.
