Xia Ge responded casually, "It's about the same, it's about the same."

After finishing her idle talk, feeling better and with a cool breeze blowing, Xia Ge thought about closing the window.

But then a gentle and fine breeze blew by.

And with the cover of the night, a dried leaf butterfly quietly drifted into her bedroom just before Xia Ge closed the window.

It carried a faint and lingering fragrance.

Xia Ge saw it at a glance and somewhat helplessly reopened the closed window. "Alright, butterfly, I'm a good person through and through, even sending Buddha to the west... How can I be so kind?"

Why hasn't such a good girl like her received good karma?

It's really unfair.

System: "......"

A cool breeze blew in through the window.

The dried leaf butterfly pretended to be dead and lay on her bed.

Xia Ge exclaimed, "Hey! You've come into my place and now you want to take over my bed. Is there no justice in this world?"

As she spoke, she rolled up her sleeves and prepared to catch it.

But the butterfly was too clever and no matter how Xia Ge tried to catch it, it dodged her and even played around in her room, as if it was teasing her.

Xia Ge: "......"

She reached for the Zhen Hun talisman by her bedside and burst into tears. "Look, senior sister, without you, even a moth bullies me."

System: "That's not your senior sister."

Xia Ge: "......I will always get back my love."

System: "Love is not your senior sister either!!"

Xia Ge pulled the Zhen Hun talisman and retorted, "Why do you always talk so much?"

 
As she was pulling on the clothes, Xia Ge suddenly felt that something was wrong. She pinched the corner of the clothes and rubbed her eyes, "Wasn't this part white just now?"

The system was unsure, "How could that be? Maybe it was just a reflection?"

Xia Ge looked at the wide-open window and the pitch-black night sky without any stars or moon. She put down the clothes with some suspicion, "Something's not right."

There was no moon to reflect any light.

Suddenly, Xia Ge's body stiffened.

...Breathing.

It was a human's...breathing.

Very sudden.

Soft and shallow, with a gentle fragrance.

Xia Ge held onto the corner of her clothes tightly, feeling just as scared as when she was drinking coffee and a human head suddenly popped out of it.

A tender arm gently embraced her neck.

The soft breaths were gently blowing by her ear.

"...Long time no see."

"Brother."

= =

In her past life.

"Clang!"

The precious jade bottle was ruthlessly smashed!

"Uncle! Who allowed you to send her a letter!"

In the grand palace hall, the luxurious and magnificent dragon-robed girl was full of anger, "It was the same when you changed my fate, I--"
"You, you make me unable to bear it!!" 

...How could she face her like this! 

Chu Huai Kingdom's face was sharp and angular, with thick black eyebrows and a dark expression. "The matter of changing fate was not my command. She volunteered for it herself." 

"Then what about this time?!" 

Chu Shi angrily pointed to a small attendant kneeling at the door, trembling in fear. "Let him imitate my handwriting and give it to my uncle. You are really too much this time, Your Majesty!" 

Chu Huai Wang remained calm. "The treasury is in deficit, and we have wars to fight. Just after taking the throne, we increased taxes, which will cause resentment among the people." 

Pausing for a moment, he continued, "Everyone knows that only Lingxi Xia Wushuang's puppetry is exquisite and unparalleled--" 

"...Ha." 

Chu Shi's voice was desolate. "...You make it impossible for me to see her again." 

Chu Huai Wang disagreed. "As a ruler, national affairs should take priority. Love between children is a taboo." 

"In this way, you have also cut off your own thoughts." 

Chu Shi looked at him expressionlessly, and the surrounding atmosphere became somewhat ominous. 

After changing fate, the girl's aura began to have subtle differences. Now, even if she was just being stared at, it made the battle-hardened Chu Huai Wang somewhat uneasy. 

He paused and said, "When the world is peaceful and the people are happy, then...you can naturally follow your heart." 

Chu Shi clenched her fists. 

"...Even if not for the world, you should also think about the people in Chu who are starving and suffering." Chu Huai Wang said, "Nowadays, the people are hungry and suffering, and the barbarians are rampant. Bandits are rampant, and Xia Wushuang was rescued by you from the bandits. Princess, how many people in this world die of starvation on the streets, how many people turn to evil because of hunger, and how many people are born to eat their own children? How many people in Chu are like Xia Wushuang, helpless and persecuted? How many people are forced to become bandits because they have no other choice? As the only heir to the Chu Kingdom, you cannot only have one person in your eyes!" 

After Chu Huai Wang finished speaking, there was silence in the hall for a long time. 

The small attendant who had imitated Chu Shi's handwriting cautiously raised his head to look. 

She seemed to be thinking about something, somewhat absent-minded. 

-"What, today is your birthday. Look at me, I forgot." 

-"Oh, are you really angry? I was just teasing you. How could I forget, little princess~"
—— "But I'm too poor, so why not give the princess a peach blossom that blooms, and then she can marry a desirable husband or even a pretty boy, haha-"

—— "What? No pretty boy? No desirable husband? Then what do you want?"

—— "......Ah, me? You want me? What do you want me for? Oh my god, you don't like me, do you? What? You like me? Say it again? You like me? Hmm, I didn't hear you clearly, do you like me? Ah, you like me."

Princess: "......Get out."

Everything from that year slowly faded away.

The young girl stood quietly in place, her white hand brushing her chest, her expression unclear. Wearing a yellow robe, a five-clawed golden dragon looked fierce, but it somehow made her seem weak.

"......But these people." She murmured, "None of them will pick a peach blossom for me on my birthday."

"The innocence of youth is enviable." King Chu Huai said, "But with the world in your hands, you no longer need that peach blossom."

In the end, it was just the joy of youth. Like a scattered flower, it fell to the ground and turned to dust, eventually becoming a pile of yellow earth, leaving no trace.

Chu Shi clenched the dragon's head on her chest tightly, her fingertips turning pale.

Finally.

"Give my orders."

"Grant Lingxi Xia Wushuang the imperial sword, and appoint her as a general......"

"......"

Chu Shi felt that every word she spoke was like a knife to her heart, making it difficult to breathe.

But she granted high positions and riches.

She wished for the peace of the kingdom.

—— "Wushuang, what do you want to do in the future?"

"Ah, just eat and drink, what dreams can a salted fish have... oh wait, I do have one. I want to become the most powerful puppet master in the world!"

Chu Shi's expression was complicated, "......You changed your mind quickly."

"I don't want the princess to think I'm useless." The girl's smile was bright, "It's not bad to work hard for the princess occasionally."

"... Just talk nonsense."

The palace lanterns swayed gently.

Chu Shi lowered her eyelashes slightly.

Lingxi Peak.

Xia Wushuang received the imperial edict, a gold and silver-inlaid sword sheathed in a gorgeous scabbard, and a vast array of treasures.

The eunuch with a message on his lips had powdered his face and was all smiles. "General Xia is so lucky. This is a sword bestowed by the princess herself. A grand banquet has been prepared for the general in the capital. May I ask when you can enter the capital..."

"No need to enter." Xia Wushuang's face remained expressionless as he drew the sword from the ornate scabbard.

The sword's plain and ancient blade was in stark contrast to the scabbard's extravagance.

The eunuch trembled in fear. "... General Xia, are you defying the imperial edict?!"

As a high-ranking eunuch, he knew that Xia Wushuang was a rising star in the emperor's inner circle and commanded an army of thirty thousand puppets. Even if he defied the edict, he could not be punished severely. All he could do was talk.

Xia Wushuang left the sword behind and calmly wrapped the imperial edict in the gorgeous scabbard, handing it over to the trembling eunuch. "No."

"Although it's a bit melodramatic," the girl in plain clothes held the sword, "you should take back everything you brought."

The chief eunuch looked at her in surprise. Although it wasn't obvious, his eyes were like those of someone who had seen a fool who wouldn't pick up money falling from the sky and stepped on it a few times.

"Take those things back and use them as military pay."

Xia Wushuang pretended not to notice and said sincerely, "I still hope you will tell her. Although I need money, I'm helping her not for wealth and power, but to ease her guilt."

"Let her not feel guilty."

The girl held the sword horizontally and looked at it.

The long sword was simple and clean, not at all matching the previously gold-inlaid and jade-wearing scabbard.

Just like the blushing girl under the peach tree.

And-

"As a princess of a country, I cannot act like this... It's just a case of strong feelings between a man and a woman."
"I understand her ambitions," Xia Wushuang's voice was as light as the wind, "I just hope she can achieve her goals."

The eunuch left in confusion.

Before leaving, he was stopped again. Xia Wushuang raised an eyebrow, "Hey, little eunuch, does this sword have a name?"

The eunuch, who had experienced the changes of two dynasties, was called out like this and had a complex expression. "This sword is the first generation general's sword under the Chu throne. Because that general was brave, the sword was collected into the national treasury. Only those who have made countless military achievements like that general are qualified to pick up this sword..."

Xia Wushuang interrupted impatiently, "I just asked if it has a name."

"The princess said that if General Xia likes it, he can name it himself."

"Oh."

The eunuch left.

Su Chan, who was hiding in the tree, snorted and threw the branch in her hand, hitting Xia Wushuang's head. "What eunuch, he's just a sissy. Why didn't they send a proper person?"

Xia Wushuang smiled bitterly, "Aren't eunuchs the ones who deliver imperial edicts?"

"Why didn't she come in person?" Su Chan persisted, "Just a sword and a title?"

Xia Wushuang held the sword in one hand and the branch in the other, and finally silently inserted the branch into the ground. "Okay, may the lucky god's branch grow quickly, I need firewood to make mushroom soup."

Su Chan was angry, "You're just fobbing me off!"

Unhappy, she jumped down from the tree and left.

Only then did Gu Peiju walk out from behind the tree.

As soon as she came out, she saw Xia Wushuang squatting on the ground, sighing. "Ajue, look, no one is happy when they're fobbed off."

Gu Peiju: "..."

"The sword is a good sword." Xia Wushuang waved it, and the sword light shone, vaguely carrying the fierce and cruel aura of the battlefield. "It's just that Ashi doesn't know how to match a scabbard... sigh, even if she knows I like money, she can't be so crude."


Gu Peijiu remembered the sword sheath that was studded with pearls and jade, and a faint smile appeared on her lips.

In the following days, Xia Wushuang always carried a sword wrapped in white cloth wherever she went. However, her eyes became darker, and her complexion became more haggard, as if she couldn't sleep well.

A few days later, Gu Peijiu was standing guard outside the door with half-closed eyes. Puppets didn't need to rest, so she always guarded Xia Wushuang's door.

There was a slight movement inside the door.

The door was quietly opened, and Gu Peijiu looked up. Xia Wushuang seemed to be awake again.

She didn't say anything to Gu Peijiu, but picked up the long sword wrapped in white cloth and left the small bamboo house.

Gu Peijiu followed her step by step.

"... "

The girl walked to the small bamboo forest, chopped down some bamboo with her sword, and then started to carve it with a small knife. The unnamed sword was placed aside.

She was carving the bamboo, seemingly in a trance. She accidentally cut her hand on a sharp piece of bamboo skin, and bright red blood flowed out. Gu Peijiu's pupils shrank, and she immediately grabbed Xia Wushuang's wrist.

"Don't do this." Her voice was slightly stern.

Xia Wushuang chuckled, "It's just a small wound, it's nothing."

But Gu Peijiu didn't listen to her, and took out a roll of bandages and some medicine from her mustard seed space, giving her a simple dressing.

Xia Wushuang was surprised, "Oh, you carry medicine with you."

Gu Peijiu replied expressionlessly, "Just in case."
