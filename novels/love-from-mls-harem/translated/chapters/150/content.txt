Moreover, Mao Qing...

Before, no matter how close he was with girls, he never felt anything. Upon careful reflection, Mao Qing was acting strangely after returning. He liked to get close to her often, but she didn't think much of it at the time and just kept a polite distance because of the saying "men and women should keep their distance." However, she was still a girl and didn't really care, so she got used to it, and even when he got closer, she didn't feel anything.

But... but...

Xia Ge touched her lips and looked at the blue sky, thinking about the warmth that felt like a kiss when Mao Qing lightly brushed her cheek yesterday.

"...Is it just me... overthinking?" Xia Ge murmured, "Am I just overthinking?"

It's like once the door to a new world is opened, everything starts to seem strange.

But regardless of whether she was overthinking or not, as Mao Qing said, she should cultivate alone and be quiet for these few days.

She bought the sugar-coated chestnuts in the system store. Hmm, it's nice to eat sugar-coated chestnuts in this chilly season.

A sugar-coated chestnut for one hundred points, it must be so delicious that she'll cry, right? Will it? It must, right?!

Xia Ge didn't know if Mao Qing would cry, but if she were to eat it herself, she would definitely cry.

The system's ability to pluck a goose without making it scream is really increasing day by day.

Just as she was thinking about it, her flowing silver ring suddenly started to heat up slightly.

Xia Ge gasped and stared at the ring.

The delicate and slender silver ring was shining with a faint light, and it was slightly hot. Actually, the ring was a bit hot a couple of days ago, but with so many things going on, the heat wasn't that noticeable, and she didn't pay much attention to it. Now that it suddenly became hot, she had to pay attention.

System: "Did you put something inside it?"

Xia Ge: "..."

There were too many things in the storage ring, dammit.

"Because the ring's level is very low, it can't hold things that are too high-level..." the system hinted, "For example, the Eight Desolation Flute."

"Similarly... if something inside the ring upgrades or undergoes some changes, um, if you don't take it out quickly, um, it will..."

Xia Ge's lips curved into a gentle smile. "...What will happen?"

The system imitated the sound of an explosion. "Boom."
Xia Ge: "......"

Bang, damn it, bang.

Regardless of whether it was effective or not, in order to prevent her companion of three years from really exploding, Xia Ge obediently emptied everything that was in the ring.

After shaking everything out of the ring, it stopped burning, but it was still warm.

"So what was it exactly?"

After rummaging through the pile of things for a while, Xia Ge still couldn't figure out what could make the ring heat up.

There was nothing precious or upgradable in there.

System: "Keep looking, there must be something hidden in there."

There were many things, letters, books and other miscellaneous items. Xia Ge searched for a while and really couldn't find anything, so she decided to sort through all the letters.

Most of them were letters sent to Chu Yao. Xia Ge scratched her head and suddenly felt a little melancholy.

"Ah, I want to go to Chang'an for a visit."

System: "......Then go."

Xia Ge: "......"

Xia Ge obediently sorted the letters and changed the subject, "The Sword Edge Seeking Spirit event at Jianfeng ended a few days ago."

System: "......" It's so awkward to change the subject so obviously!

System: "Why didn't you go?"

Xia Ge muttered to herself, "I heard that Ye Ze became a new candidate for the senior disciple."

The more Xia Ge changed the subject, the more curious the system became and it asked, "I'm asking you why you didn't go to Chang'an, don't give me any irrelevant answers."

Xia Ge didn't say anything, she just felt a little sad.

According to the rules of Jianfeng, if someone is a candidate for the senior disciple for three consecutive years, they can be directly promoted to a senior disciple.

Chu Yao had been a candidate for two consecutive terms and was only one term away from letting Chang Lan pack up and leave. However, she was suddenly called back to inherit her family's mine, and she ended up giving away the mine at Lingxi Peak for nothing.
As she thought about it, it really made her sad. Although Lingxi Peak's mine was only one-third of Chu's family, it was still good enough.

And...

If she went back, she would live under the glory of King Chu again.

"If only she could come back." 

The system said, "If you want her to come back, go to Chang'an and call her back."

"It's not that I want her to come back," Xia Ge put down the letter and said, "It's that I know she wants to come back."

That was the Sword Peak, where Chu Yao broke free from the shackles of her family and just spread her wings. She hoped to make some achievements, to let people see her true brilliance, to return home with glory and freedom.

Not to be brought back when she was still inexperienced and burdened with everything she should not have to bear, under the praise of others like "worthy of being King Chu's descendant".

Xia Ge sighed, "Recently, the people on Sword Peak are becoming more and more dissatisfied."

If only Chu Yao were still here.

Xia Ge thought that if Chu Yao were here, although she would not show up, she would secretly take care of everything.

Not like now...

For some reason, Xia Ge suddenly thought of Chu Yi's pitch-black and ruthless eyes and everything that happened that day. She realized belatedly that the fragile little butterfly from back then was now hidden like a king in Sword Peak, seemingly unknown but actually sharp and powerful.

But now, the one who stood out in Sword Peak was Ye Ze.

But since he had passed the Sword Peak's test, it meant that in these three years, the male protagonist had begun his long journey like Dragon Aotian.

The child who used to be uncomfortable when she called him "brother" in the middle of the night and followed the rules had started to trample on them and use everything to his advantage since the former leader of the Demon Cult escaped three years ago.

But now, these things had nothing to do with her.

Her slender fingertips unconsciously brushed over the "Song" in the corner of the envelope, and Xia Ge's long eyelashes drooped down.

-- Xia Wu Yin.

"Xia Wu Yin..."
"......No chants."

"Brother..."

"Xiaozhangling."

"......"

Many, many titles.

But not a single one was her real name.

- The old man was just afraid that you would suffocate and forget your own name.

- Thinking herself clever, she ended up outsmarting herself.

Then came the face of the evil spirit and the sea of fire.

Xia Ge slightly pinched the corner of the envelope, staring at the word "Song" and suddenly realized.

The friend who could call her by her real name was no longer here.

The past was gone, and the present had changed.

After a while, she suddenly said, "This letter is definitely not it."

Then she put the letter into her ring, which did not change at all.

If there was something in the ring that exceeded the level it could hold, it would not fit. Xia Ge put everything she had taken out one by one into the ring, and suddenly she found that when she took everything out, she did not notice that there were many things hidden deep in her memory that were almost forgotten.

- The shiny folding sickle that accompanied her through the mountains and alleys, three sets of night clothes for sneaking around, several sets of washed Danfeng plain clothes, half-finished dolls sewn in her spare time, a pile of letters to and from Chang'an, senior sister's light green letter paper, many elixirs she had refined, miscellaneous formation diagrams and alchemy books she had collected but had no time to assemble into puppets, a large bag of middle-grade spirit stones she had sold for elixirs in the black market, a note about Lingxi Patriarch taken from the library, a delicate fox mask, and a teleportation stone taken from the Patriarch's tomb a long time ago...

Xia Ge stared at the fox mask for a long time.

The exquisite and lovely little fox, with a cunning smile, immediately brought back memories of three years ago in the black market.

- "I'll take you home."

Xia Ge tightened her grip on the mask and then put it back into the ring.

System: "This mask can also adjust its size on its own. Would you like to consider exchanging it for some points?"
Summer Song was cold and ruthless: "No consideration."

System: "Ah, why bother dwelling on the past? It's more practical to earn more points."

Summer Song: "Tsk, you talk too much, not interested."

Everything was sorted out, and all that was left was the teleportation stone in front of her.

The system couldn't remember: "Teleportation stone? When did you get this teleportation stone?"

"...Three years ago, from the old ancestor's tomb." Summer Song always remembered clearly the things she risked her life to obtain.

The teleportation stone she got from the puppet in the tomb.

She vaguely remembered the night she was led to the old ancestor's tomb by a lost deer. Three arrays, fire-breathing puppet beasts, puppet formations, and murals on the ceiling. Oh, and the red-clothed girl who stabbed her... It was like a dream and not quite real.

Because the woman in the red clothes said that the teleportation stone would send people to strange places, so in the end, when Summer Song fainted, she didn't use it. When she woke up, she was already on the back mountain.

Summer Song picked up the teleportation stone and examined it. If the things in front of her were put into the ring without any problems, then only this stone remained.

The teleportation stone was transparent and exquisite, polished to perfection. It refracted a seven-colored light in the fine sunlight. Summer Song tried to put it in the ring, but it was immediately rejected.

System: "...It's actually a teleportation stone?"

Summer Song was also a little surprised. She put it in the sunlight and looked carefully. There was a faint golden light in the center of the teleportation stone. Her pupils shrank slightly, and her eyes were slowly stained with a green color, looking strange and mysterious. "Teleportation stones can also level up? Is this a very powerful teleportation stone?"

【Scouting】

【Double Different Teleportation Stone: A mysterious teleportation stone with two target locations, "surface target" and "inside target." It is usually created for the constantly moving "inside target," and only when the "inside target" moves to a specific position or a certain "opportunity" predetermined by the teleportation stone maker appears, will the teleportation stone send people to the "inside target."】

After becoming an advanced puppet master, all her skills had improved significantly. Perhaps it was due to the combination of her body's dragon blood, her scouting skill had also leveled up. When she used it again, her eyes turned green, and her pupils shrank like animal pupils. The advantage was that the things she detected were clearer and more distinct.

But it was too obvious.

So over time, if it wasn't necessary, Summer Song wouldn't use this ability much.

"Double Different Teleportation Stone..." Summer Song frowned.

"A teleportation stone with two target locations, it's very rare." The system exclaimed, "There must have been some changes that awakened it."

"So, if I crush this teleportation stone now, I will be sent to a different place than the specific location of the previous teleportation stone?"
System: "...It's best not to touch it. This should be something left behind by Lingxi Patriarch. The destination it teleports to is probably not a simple place."

Xia Ge: "Will the location change?"

System: "No, once the 'opportunity' that allows the Double Differentiation Teleportation Stone to change its 'target location' appears, the 'external target' will be erased and replaced by the 'internal target'."

Xia Ge pondered for a moment and her gaze inadvertently swept over the small note that she had not yet put into her ring. As her Detection Art receded, her eyes returned to normal and she slightly narrowed them.

-"A million corpses, wailing evil spirits, sealed in Wuyi Mountain, playing the soul for fifty years, unable to atone for their sins. -Anonymous."

It was the note that Lingxi Patriarch wrote and hid in the library.

A long, long time ago, her senior sister's words still echoed in her ears.

-"Legend has it that an immortal turned Wuyi Mountain into a magical treasure, suppressing countless evil spirits at the foot of the mountain, called the Mountain of Wailing Spirits, hidden among the sea of clouds. From then on, there was no Wuyi Mountain in the world, only the Mountain of Wailing Spirits that existed in legends."

-"No one knows when and where it will appear."

Lingxi Patriarch's note about Wuyi Mountain, or rather, the Mountain of Wailing Spirits, a moving Mountain of Wailing Spirits, and the Double Differentiation Teleportation Stone made for the constantly changing "internal target" in the burial mound...?

In almost an instant, Xia Ge felt her blood boiling all over her body. Almost at the same time, the system and she said together -

-"Soul Suppression."

-"...Soul Suppression!"

Since returning from the Bai Meng Cave three years ago, breaking off ties with Ye Ze, becoming the Dan Peak Sect Leader, and having everything taken care of by her senior sister, Xia Ge had food and drink, and could earn a huge sum of money just by making pills. She had the charming clothes and the lovesickness charm with her at all times. As for the Mountain of Wailing Spirits and Soul Suppression, she just started to believe in the idea that believing would make it happen and not believing would make it not happen... and so on.

Who would have thought that surprises really do come when you least expect them.

Fate obviously wouldn't let those who don't work hard have an easy time.

Two days after Xia Ge discovered that the teleportation stone in her hand was a directional teleportation stone that teleports to the Mountain of Wailing Spirits -

The Mountain of Wailing Spirits appeared.

At the same time, news of the unparalleled Soul Suppression being in the Mountain of Wailing Spirits spread like wildfire. Soon, everyone knew that after the Chu family's Chu Dao Sacrifice, the Chang family's Sky of Azure Brilliance, the Thousand Soul Sect's Blood-stained Spring and Autumn, and the Lingxi Peak's Heavenly Punishment Silk, the fifth ancient charming clothes, the unparalleled Soul Suppression, was about to appear.
