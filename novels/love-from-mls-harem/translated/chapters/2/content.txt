"My face is not lost."

Xia Wuyin felt her body lighten and a soft hand grabbed her waist, pulling her into a soft embrace. When she looked up, she saw her senior sister's cold chin in her line of sight.

She landed lightly on the ground.

Feeling relieved that she didn't embarrass herself or lose her face towel, Xia Wuyin immediately started acting recklessly. She hugged Gu Peiju's waist from behind and said, "Thank you, Senior Sister, for saving me. I am grateful. I just don't know if your heart is as beautiful as your face..."

With a small red silk knife in her right hand, Xia Wuyin pointed it at Gu Peiju's vital point, while her left hand touched Gu Peiju's face. Her voice was ambiguous as she said, "It's so soft and sweet?"

With her cross-dressing and boyish voice, coupled with her beautiful and slightly raised eyes, she was truly tempting.

Gu Peiju held her expressionlessly, not letting go. Xia Wuyin was only eight or nine years old when she transmigrated, and she was only twelve or thirteen when she entered the sect. Now being held by Gu Peiju, who was much taller than her, she couldn't even reach the ground with her feet. Her little arm could barely reach around Gu Peiju's waist, and the small knife in her hand was pointed precisely at Gu Peiju's vital point.

"Since Sister is so beautiful, why not spare my life?" Xia Wuyin's mouth was sweet, but her grip was tight, and she was actually very insecure.

Gu Peiju looked at her for a while, then suddenly let go.

Caught off guard by the sudden release, Xia Wuyin's feet touched the ground, but the small knife missed its target. Gu Peiju twisted her arm behind her back, and the red silk ribbon flew up, first tying her arm behind her back, then twisting her into a bundle.

Seeing herself tied up like a red worm and facing Gu Peiju's expressionless face, Xia Wuyin knew she was done for. No, she knew she was done for when the small knife missed its target.

Xia Wuyin's mind was full of fear as her face suddenly felt cold.

Her face towel was taken off.

Great, she had lost her last shred of dignity.

Xia Wuyin opened her small eyes wide and quickly turned her brain. She tried to squeeze out a few tears like a crocodile and looked like a pitiful victim of rape. "I'm sorry, Senior Sister... I..."

Finally, Gu Peiju, the senior sister who had descended from Danfeng Peak, spoke her first words to Xia Wuyin since they met in the mountains.

"You are a disciple of Danfeng Peak?"

Xia Wuyin, who had been a handyman disciple at Danfeng for two years, was not surprised. Gu Peiju had only been at Danfeng for half a year, but she was extremely talented, with a unique bone structure and fast cultivation speed. She had rapidly advanced to become Danfeng's senior sister, while Xia Wuyin was preparing for her inevitable sixth attempt at the entrance exam.

As for the results of the exam, let's not talk about it.
However, she knew the magnificent senior sister, who may not know who she was. Xia Wuyin immediately burst into tears and introduced herself: "Senior sister! Great senior sister! I am Xia Wuyin, the 88th disciple of the 556th generation of the outer sect of Lingxi Mountain Danfeng in XX District!"

Gu Peijiu ignored her long self-introduction with the location and house number and reached out to Xia Wuyin's waist. She found a piece of identity jade pendant and Xia Wuyin was wrapped in a red ribbon and couldn't resist. She could only scream and squirm, looking like a ridiculous caterpillar from afar. Gu Peijiu directly ignored her gibberish about "sexual harassment," "taking advantage," and "touching tofu," and verified the authenticity of the identity jade pendant before coldly saying, "You remember your own house so clearly, but you don't remember the Danfeng Mountain rules?"

Xia Wuyin was suddenly speechless and stopped squirming, lying there like a red tropical salted fish that had been drowned. Gu Peijiu continued, "Shall I repeat it? The 88th rule of the Danfeng Mountain rules is that no disciple of Danfeng Mountain is allowed to enter the back mountain. Violators will be expelled from Danfeng Mountain."

Xia Wuyin's eyes lit up, and she tried to turn over like a salted fish, "Really?! That's great! I understand the rules, but I have always wanted to ask, if I am expelled from Danfeng Mountain, can I go to Jianfeng Mountain?"

Gu Peijiu said, "...or copy the rules three thousand times to set an example."

Perhaps Xia Wuyin's disappointment was too obvious on her face, and Gu Peijiu couldn't help but say, "What's wrong with Danfeng Mountain?"

Xia Wuyin weakly lifted her chin, and Gu Peijiu followed her gaze to see the result of Xia Wuyin's hard work...no, stolen goods - the glass wood was lying on the dry leaves on the ground at this time, shining with five colors in the moonlight.

Gu Peijiu frowned, "Glass wood?"

"Yes..." Xia Wuyin was barely breathing, "I am very grateful to Danfeng Mountain for nurturing me..."

"Danfeng Mountain has countless advantages...the senior and junior brothers and sisters get along well and there is brotherhood..." 

"But there is one thing that is extremely hateful and difficult to speak about..." 

Gu Peijiu found that Xia Wuyin was very good at dragging things out, "Get to the point."

After rescuing Xia Wuyin from falling off the branch, the unsettling demonic energy on the back mountain had disappeared. This was also why she could leisurely listen to Xia Wuyin's dragging. Then she heard Xia Wuyin seriously say, "Senior sister...the outer disciples of Danfeng Mountain are too poor."

Gu Peijiu: "..."

Seeing Gu Peijiu's subtle expression, Xia Wuyin immediately began her tearful complaint, "Senior sister! The hateful people must have pitiful circumstances! Going against the rules and entering the back mountain was my fault. Please expel me from Danfeng Mountain...no, I mean, look at this glass wood. It only sells for ten taels of silver in the mortal world and only two medium-grade spirit stones among cultivators. I struggle to make ends meet with three copper coins a day, and it takes me ten days or half a month to save up to drink a jug of yellow wine outside..."

"Danfeng Mountain prohibits drinking." 

Xia Wuyin's expression changed, and she became serious, "I drank it outside, so it doesn't count."
If caught drinking in Dan Peak, you will be fined ten middle-grade spirit stones!

With only three copper coins a day for outer disciples of Dan Peak, can she even afford to eat?

Gu Peijiu: "You're only twelve or thirteen years old, why are you drinking?"

Xia Wuyin laughed mischievously, "Which disciple's life is full of romance? One drink can solve a thousand worries!"

Gu Peijiu remained expressionless, "Wrong, that's not how it goes."

What a twisted poem.

Xia Wuyin coughed, "It doesn't matter if the poem is twisted or not... Senior Sister, to become a named disciple instead of an outer disciple, you need to refine the Pigu Pill in the monthly sect assessment... and the material for that Pigu Pill is the Lulimu!"

"Calculating, it's been three years since I joined, and I failed six consecutive times..."

Gu Peijiu corrected her, "It's been two years."

Xia Wuyin shamelessly said, "It's all the same, anyway, I've lost everything."

Gu Peijiu couldn't help but say, "The Pigu Pill isn't a complicated pill formula, and it doesn't require spiritual power enhancement. Even ordinary pharmacists can occasionally make similar Pigu Pills..."

...How could she fail six times in a row?

Xia Wuyin sighed, "It's my innate talent."

Gu Peijiu: "..."

She said affectionately, "Senior Sister, maybe I'm more suited for a career like Sword Peak, where I can be brave and chivalrous, rob the rich and help the poor, and travel the world with a sword..."

Gu Peijiu glanced at the corner of the night clothes under the red silk.

Xia Wuyin obviously noticed her Senior Sister's meaningful gaze, but her face remained unchanged, "Sometimes, thieves in the martial world are also very admirable."

Gu Peijiu grabbed the red silk and lifted her up, coldly saying, "Unfortunately, our Lingxi Mountain doesn't have a Robber Peak."

Xia Wuyin, who was swaying in Gu Peijiu's hand, turned a little pale, but her mouth remained tough, "It's really regrettable."

Gu Peijiu sneered, "Xia Wuyin, an outer disciple of Dan Peak, violates 88, 44, and 32 mountain rules, copy the Dan rules three thousand times, and forfeit one month's salary. In addition, she will face the wall for a month to reflect on her actions!"

The identity jade pendant had the number and name on it, and Xia Wuyin was not surprised that Gu Peijiu knew her name.
Xia Wu Yin forced a smile, "My disciple number is also 88... lucky, but why haven't I gotten rich... not big senior sister! I mean, what's the deal with Article 44 and Article 32? A month's salary?! Only 90 copper coins per month!!"

By the end, she was already at the end of her rope, but her pale little face still firmly maintained a stance of standing up for herself and demanding justice.

Seeing that she didn't look well, Gu Peiju considered that although she had done something wrong, she was still a twelve or thirteen year old child, so she tied the red ribbon around her waist, bound Xia Wu Yin on her back, and her voice remained cold, "Article 44, disrespect towards elders, punished with salary deduction."

Xia Wu Yin tried to clear her name, "Where was the disrespect?! As soon as we met, I called you big senior sister!"

It was heart-wrenching to think about.

Gu Peiju remained unmoved, "Article 32, threatening elders, punished with a higher degree of punishment."

Xia Wu Yin refused to admit it, "No, I didn't!"

Gu Peiju said, "Article 31, denying wrongdoing until death, another month's salary deduction."

Xia Wu Yin's heart was as good as dead.

Feeling the silence behind her, Gu Peiju's lips curled slightly.

The noisy kid finally quieted down.

She turned around to leave the back mountain, but suddenly heard the cautious voice of the person on her back, "Um... my hard work... no, I mean the glass wood..."

Xia Wu Yin's heart was bleeding, "Could you, by the way... take it with you? Big senior sister! The bright future of Danfeng Mountain needs me!"

It was really heart-wrenching, and anyone listening would be moved to tears, thinking she had suffered a lot of injustice.

Gu Peiju said casually, "Didn't you say you wanted to go to Jianfeng Mountain?"

Xia Wu Yin: "..."

Gu Peiju raised her eyebrows slightly, "Hmm?"

Xia Wu Yin looked serious, "After much deliberation, I have found that the people of Jianfeng Mountain are too aggressive and not suitable for someone like me who seeks tranquility."

Gu Peiju said lightly, "I don't think Danfeng Mountain is suitable either."

Even six times of taking the Purification Pill was rare.
Xia Wuyin rode up and hit the snake with the stick, cautiously and with a straight face. "You see, even Senior Sister thinks like this... Why don't you just expel me from Dan Peak instead of making me copy the Dan training? I heard that Beast Peak is also in need of manpower lately..."

Gu Peijiu's tone raised slightly, "Oh? Then it seems like you don't need the Lulimu to pass the Dan Peak assessment."

After speaking, she turned to leave.

Xia Wuyin immediately howled heartbreakingly, "No - Senior Sister! I found out that I still like Dan Peak the most! I like it the most!! Senior Sister from Dan Peak is so beautiful! The most beautiful! I want to stay in Dan Peak and watch Senior Sister forever!!"

A flock of crows flew up in alarm.

Gu Peijiu's face turned half black, "Shut up!"

Xia Wuyin immediately shut her mouth obediently.

She was afraid that she would be given the title of disrespecting her teacher again and be punished by deducting her salary for a month.

The girl with delicate red maple embroidered on her cuff picked up the Lulimu on the ground expressionlessly and put it in her sleeve, "After copying the Dan training three thousand times, come to me to exchange it."

"Oh."

"And, keep your word."

"Uh...?"

"Door Rule No. 46..."

"Ah ah, I'll keep my word! I will stay in Dan Peak and watch Senior Sister forever!"

Gu Peijiu's face turned completely black, and she restrained herself, "That's not what I meant."

Xia Wuyin: "Then... Senior Sister is the most beautiful?"

Gu Peijiu: "...No."

Xia Wuyin was also desperate, "Then what do you mean?"

Gu Peijiu's forehead bulged with blue veins, "Shut up!"

Who the hell knows what she means!
