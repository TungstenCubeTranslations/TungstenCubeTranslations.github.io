Xia Ge was lost in thought and didn't notice the awkwardness of Bi Xi. She came back to her senses when Bi Xi asked, "Would you like some tea?"

They both fell silent and looked at Gu Peijiu.

"Miss Xia's aura feels very familiar," Bi Xi broke the silence.

Xia Ge's heart tightened slightly. She was afraid of being recognized. She could face the criticism of the world, but she might not be able to face the disappointment and disdain of the people around her senior sister.

"Is that so?" she said naturally. "Maybe I'm just good with words."

"When did Miss Xia meet Miss Gu?" Bi Xi asked again.

Xia Ge understood why Bi Xi asked these questions. Besides her, Bi Xi had been by Senior Sister's side all these years. In their years of interaction, Bi Xi was more like a caring family member to Senior Sister.

Naturally, she couldn't help but ask more questions.

"Once we met," Xia Ge said. "When I was buying medicine in the black market."

It wasn't difficult to make up a story. Xia Ge came up with a romantic story of a beautiful pharmacist being kidnapped by people from the black market and then saved by Gu Peijiu, who rushed over in an emergency. 

"And then, I went on a journey, while she continued to be a senior disciple at Danfeng," Xia Ge added.

Bi Xi thought for a moment and suddenly became suspicious. "Hmm, that's not right?"

Xia Ge remained calm. "What's wrong?"

Bi Xi asked, "Did Miss Gu not say anything else?"

Xia Ge replied, unfazed, "No, she didn't."

Was there something she said that was not quite right?

Bi Xi said, "Oh, I see."

However, she was a little suspicious. The black market was Senior Sister's inherited business. Although she didn't pay much attention to it, if the people from the black market attacked Xia Ge, shouldn't Senior Sister have stopped them?

"I think the attackers on Miss Xia might not be from the black market," Bi Xi thought for a moment and decided to clear their business's name. "There are some disciples of the demonic cult... They bought some of the black market's industries, so it is possible that they are the ones causing trouble."
Xia Ge let out a sigh of relief and coughed, "Actually, it's not important."

What's important is that you believed it.

The night grew deeper.

Bixi slept next door, and Xia Ge said she was worried about her savior and found a small stool to sit by her bed.

Bixi wasn't very worried either. The fact that her Tianzhu Ling didn't resist proved that this was indeed a trustworthy person.

Xia Ge looked at her senior sister's quiet sleeping face, lost in thought and reminiscing - when her senior sister was angry, her beautiful lips would purse into a thin line, and her gaze would be cold like a cutting blade, sending chills down one's spine. When she was happy, her eyes wouldn't curve up, but her white jade-like face would still be expressionless, and her rosy lips would quietly curl up into a small arc, a half-smiling expression that was so beautiful it was breathtaking.

Even now.

Quiet and still, with long eyelashes and rosy lips, she was especially beautiful.

...It seemed like one glance was all it took to make one's heart skip a beat.

No one was around.

Xia Ge, like a thief, quietly reached out and touched Gu Peijiu's forehead, which was warm.

Warm to the point where she didn't want to retract her hand.

As she continued to feel the warmth, Xia Ge began to feel a little sad.

After this trip, she lost her yearning and her senior sister, and had nothing left.

She was truly useless to the extreme.

Xia Ge had a somewhat despicable thought, fortunately, fortunately, her senior sister didn't open her eyes now. If she saw Xia Ge in such a sorry state, she would also feel uncomfortable.

"If...if you suddenly open your eyes and smile at me, that would be great." Xia Ge muttered to herself, "That would be great."

Of course, her senior sister couldn't suddenly open her eyes and look at her.

Xia Ge suddenly felt her heart was full and empty at the same time.

She couldn't stay here any longer.

She simply walked out the door and walked far, far away. The unknown white flower tree on Danfeng Road hadn't bloomed yet, with no petals along the way. Above her head was a lonely moon, with not even a single star visible -
A long time ago, they walked on this road, and Senior Sister blew a tune of returning home with a leaf. But now, it seems that no one can walk behind her anymore. Xia Ge thought. She strolled to her small room, where the branches and leaves of the parasol tree were lush, like the appearance of spring. Xia Ge jumped onto the roof of her room, as usual, and looked far away at Senior Sister's cottage. The night was peaceful, the leaves rustled, the frogs croaked, and there was a flickering candlelight in the room, but there was no shadow of the person grading papers that she could see here every night. Xia Ge did not know what she was feeling sad about, and what she was looking forward to. However, this night was very quiet. Therefore, there was no miracle. However, there were hidden, secretly observing eyes. Xia Ge had discovered it a long time ago. These eyes followed her from Evil Spirit Mountain, like a shadow, making her feel uncomfortable, even creepy. At first, Xia Ge thought it was Ye Ze who suspected her identity as Xia Wu Yin, but after testing it, it was obviously not the case. Ye Ze was observing her, but it was obviously only caution and testing towards non-disciples of the sect, not this kind of somewhat fanatic... even strange gaze. If it was not Ye Ze, who would it be? Coming out from Senior Sister's place, she even intentionally went to the room where she was once "Xia Wu Yin". Besides feeling a little sad, she also wanted to lure this person out and observe his identity. However, this person was very cautious, and Xia Ge blew the cold wind alone in the room all night, but she did not see any trace of him. The eastern sky was faintly brightening with the belly of a fish, and the sky was getting brighter. Xia Ge withdrew her thoughts, and she looked at the sky gradually dyed red by the gorgeous sunrise in the distance, suddenly wanting someone by her side. She had been lonely, confused, dead, alive, lost, and joyful. She had experienced everything. The sails had passed. Xia Ge suddenly realized that today's sunrise was so beautiful that it was hard to breathe. And the person who could share this beauty and joy with her had not yet opened his eyes.
It was heavy, painful, yet warm at the same time.

The soul was tormented by soul poison to the point of unbearable pain, as if it had fallen into hell. However, that warmth made her feel as if she was floating on clouds.

Even if it meant dying, she was willing.

The soul poison became more and more intense.

The soul was torn apart by the soul poison, and under the intense pain, Gu Peijiu's consciousness slowly began to blur.

Gu Peijiu thought that she might not be able to hold on much longer.

She didn't know what would happen if she wasn't there...what would happen to that person.

Thinking of the words Su Chan had said, Gu Peijiu felt a slight pain in her heart.

She couldn't do this.

She had to go find her.

But the soul poison was getting stronger and stronger, as if it was trying to defeat her.

Gu Peijiu struggled a few times, but it was useless.

She was getting more and more exhausted.

...She couldn't do it anymore.

Suddenly, a soft scent spread out.

The painful soul suddenly began to tremble. Gu Peijiu was slightly surprised, she felt...

There were sweet lips intertwined with hers, a soft tongue licked her teeth, slowly prying them apart. A warm flow spread from her lips, down her limbs, through her internal organs, and then deeply penetrated her soul.

That warm flow, carrying a gentle soul power, warmed her cold and broken soul, repairing the damaged gaps caused by the soul poison, like rain on a dry land.

Suddenly, it didn't hurt anymore.

Her heart didn't hurt anymore.
Only warmth filled her heart.

She could feel it.

This person was here.

Here... waiting for her to come back.

It was peaceful and gentle.

As she drifted off into a daze, Gu Peiju's consciousness gradually sank into slumber. Exhaustion washed over her like a tide, but she felt at ease.

...You're here.

I'm in your arms.

It's very comforting.

Just sleep like this...it's okay.

She didn't know how long it had been.

Her soul seemed to be sleeping, but it began to awaken strangely.

Gu Peiju slowly opened her eyes.

What she saw was a sky filled with soft, white clouds. She was standing on a cloud, barefoot, with her white clothes fluttering in the wind.

She lowered her gaze, her wrist as white as snow, but she couldn't see the shadow of Tian Zhu Ling.

Was she dead?

Gu Peiju wondered.

...No, not yet.

The Soul Poison would make her disappear without a trace.

So, being conscious meant she wasn't dead yet.

Someone's gaze was fixed on her.
Gu Peijiu looked up and saw a black-cloaked girl standing not far away. She was completely wrapped in the cloak, wearing a black hat, and staring at her with shallow eyes.

Gu Peijiu had seen her before.

In the White Dream Cave.

Gu Peijiu wasn't surprised, and even felt calm. She asked softly, "Who are you?"

"I'm Dou Dou." The girl looked at her, her voice somewhat hoarse. She took a step towards her after saying one word.

Although she felt like she was standing not far away, she took four steps without any sense of approaching.

Gu Peijiu felt that the name was unfamiliar, but seemed to have heard it somewhere before.

Her memory was not bad. After thinking for a while, she remembered that three years ago, Xia Wuyin had suffered a serious injury that caused her to fall into a coma. At that time, she kept saying "Dou Dou."

However, she had never mentioned this name again since then.

It may not be the same person.

"Dou Dou." Gu Peijiu repeated the name.

"It's Dou Dou, and also..." Dou Dou looked at her. "Also... Gu Peijiu."

In the moment she said the last three words, the distant distance between the two suddenly narrowed. In that instant, the veil covering the girl's face fell, and they faced each other with two identical faces.

- Flowers bloom in two lives, between Buddha and demons in life.

This should have been a very surprising thing, but Gu Peijiu didn't feel any astonishment, as if it should have been like this.

"If I don't come to find you again." Dou Dou's eyes were pitch black. "You will die."

Gu Peijiu looked at her without speaking.

"I don't want... to see that day." Dou Dou's voice was clear. "But I still didn't expect it to come so soon."

Her slender hand gently stroked Gu Peijiu's face, her gaze somewhat blurred. "...She fell in love with you, didn't she?"

Gu Peijiu didn't resist her touch. It was a resonance of souls, but she didn't answer Dou Dou's question.
"Great." Dou Dou said, "I've been waiting for this day...for a long time."

"Why is it the same day?" Dou Dou hugged Gu Peijiu, it was an embrace without warmth. Her long eyelashes trembled slightly as she murmured, "Why did she fall in love with you and want to die with you on the same day?"

Gu Peijiu said, "I won't die."

"Yes...you won't die." Dou Dou whispered, "You are me, and if I don't die, you won't die either."

"But before you go back, I want to tell you a long story." Dou Dou said, "A story...about the past."

Dou Dou whispered, "You...must listen to this story."

Gu Peijiu came to her senses and found that the surroundings had changed.

It was a bamboo forest surrounded by wooden fences. Gu Peijiu knew this place, it was the illusion she had in the White Dream Cave.

About Xia Wushuang and Chu Shi's...story?

Dou Dou's voice sounded softly, slowly telling the story from hundreds of years ago.

"Not long ago, the princess who was married off was taken back by Xia Wushuang, and the barbarians launched a war...but there were no usable soldiers."

"The princess had the aura of a queen, but not the mandate of heaven. She was weak and sickly, unable to touch the bloody and evil aura."

"... "

The princess Chu Shi, who was brought back, was melancholy.

A peach tree was planted in front of the bamboo house, and the peach blossoms were already starting to fade.

Xia Wushuang stood in front of the bamboo house, holding a bowl of porridge with great care, "A Shi, it's time to eat."

Gu Peijiu suddenly realized that Xia Wushuang's face was exactly the same as Xia Wuyin's.

Gu Peijiu: "Why is she...the same?"

"To make you recognize her." Dou Dou's voice was quiet, "I have been worried day and night."

- Afraid that you will miss her without knowing anything.

Therefore, she made the Xia Wushuang in Gu Peijiu's dream look exactly like Xia Wuyin.
Chu Shi pushed the door and came out.

Gu Peijiu stood behind Xia Wushuang and saw the thin Chu Shi.

Xia Wushuang complained, "Hey, you've lost so much weight. Your uncle will definitely blame me when he sees you, saying that I haven't taken care of you well..."

She paused, "Anyway, eat more."

"...I can't eat." Chu Shi shook her head, hesitated to speak, "Wushuang..."

Xia Wushuang seemed not to notice her hesitation and persisted, "You have to eat. If you don't eat, I won't leave."

Chu Shi sighed and took the porridge.

The two sat on the blue stone steps under the eaves. Xia Wushuang crossed her legs and casually drew circles on the ground with a bamboo stick, while Chu Shi quietly drank her porridge, peach petals falling gently, delicate and gentle.
