Chapter 174: I Am You

In the dimly lit room, the two figures faced each other in silence. One was a tall, muscular man with a stern expression, while the other was a petite woman with a delicate face.

"I know who you are," the man said in a low voice. "You're the one who's been causing trouble for us."

The woman didn't respond, but her eyes flickered with defiance.

"You think you can just waltz in here and do whatever you want?" the man continued, his voice rising in anger. "Well, I've got news for you. This is my territory, and I won't let anyone threaten it."

The woman remained silent, but her fists clenched at her sides.

The man took a step forward, his eyes blazing. "You're going to pay for what you've done. You're going to suffer like you've never suffered before."

Suddenly, the woman spoke. "I'm not afraid of you," she said, her voice steady. "I know who you are too. You're the one who's been terrorizing this neighborhood. You're the one who's been hurting innocent people."

The man's expression darkened. "You don't know what you're talking about," he growled.

"I know enough," the woman said, taking a step forward. "And I'm not going to let you get away with it anymore. I'm going to stop you, no matter what it takes."

The man sneered. "You think you can stop me? You're nothing but a weak little girl."

The woman's eyes blazed with anger. "I'm not weak," she said, her voice rising. "And I'm not a little girl. I'm a fighter, just like you. And I'm not going to let you hurt anyone else."

The two figures stood facing each other, their eyes locked in a silent battle. And in that moment, they both knew that only one of them would walk away from this room alive.
