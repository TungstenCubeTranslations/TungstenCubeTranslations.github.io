Chapter 138: Ghost Dragon Jade [Tragic]

In the ancient temple, there was a legendary treasure known as the Ghost Dragon Jade. It was said that whoever possessed this jade would have immense power and wealth.

The protagonist of our story, a young man named Liang, was obsessed with finding the Ghost Dragon Jade. He believed that it was the key to his success and happiness.

Liang spent years searching for the jade, traveling to remote corners of the world and facing countless dangers. Finally, he found it in a hidden cave deep in the mountains.

But as he reached out to touch the jade, he was suddenly struck by a powerful force. He fell to the ground, writhing in pain as his body was consumed by a dark energy.

The Ghost Dragon Jade was cursed, and whoever possessed it would suffer a tragic fate. Liang had fallen victim to the curse, and his once bright future was now shrouded in darkness.

From that day on, Liang's life was plagued by misfortune and tragedy. He lost everything he held dear, including his family, his friends, and his wealth.

In the end, Liang realized that the pursuit of power and wealth had led him down a path of destruction. He had sacrificed everything for a mere trinket, and it had cost him everything.

The Ghost Dragon Jade remained in the cave, a silent witness to the tragedy that had unfolded. It was a reminder that sometimes, the things we desire most can lead to our downfall.
