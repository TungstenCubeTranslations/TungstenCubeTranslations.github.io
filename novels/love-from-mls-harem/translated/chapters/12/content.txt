"Ah ah ah - there's a monster behind us ah ah ah -"

Summer quickly snapped out of it and closed her eyes in a frightened expression, holding the child tightly and screaming, "Ah ah ah we're going to die - help me ah ah ah!"

The sharp scream temporarily broke the state of being mesmerized by the Soul Stealing technique, but it still allowed the affected soul to unconsciously follow their own commands.

- Closed.

Those beautiful eyes, closed.

Closed?!

Chu Yao suddenly snapped out of it, but felt inexplicably anxious.

Very anxious.

She wanted... she wanted to take another look.

... He's yelling for help?

Save him!

- It's her duty!

"Chirp -"

The long sword flipped in an instant, the girl didn't even turn her head, just stared at the green-haired boy who was holding the little girl and trembling like a fool with closed eyes and lowered head. And with a backhand swing of the long sword, it pierced straight into the forehead of a demonic puppet with a green mask that was trying to ambush them from behind!

Chu Yao's long sword trembled slightly downwards, and the puppet was split in half from the forehead and fell to the ground with a loud crash.

Anyone who wants to harm this person... no matter who they are, must be killed!!

That kind of thought was like a frenzy, raging in her mind.

"Hey."

The girl's voice was slightly low, Summer tightly closed his eyes, holding the frightened little girl, his whole body trembling slightly.

Will she be discovered?

Puppet secret technique, Soul Stealing - can control all puppets with soul fire from A to E level, as well as skills of human souls with strength from A to SS level -
Human strength can be divided into F to 3S, and the soul can also be divided into these levels.

However, she is currently only a puppet apprentice and can only control puppet soul fires below B level and souls of the same level. But it still has some influence on those from A to 3S.

The swordsmen of Jianfeng usually focus on cultivating their strength and swordsmanship, and do not study soul techniques much. So this Jianfeng girl... must have fallen for it just now!

It's not a big deal to be controlled now, but when this person comes to their senses in a few days, she's sure to be dead!

Damn!

But the only thing to be thankful for is that this person probably doesn't know who she is.

Xia Ge's brain quickly started working.

Her "Soul Seizing" technique is rarely used and her proficiency is not enough. It should not have a long-term effect on the opponent. Just now when she shouted "help," it was actually equivalent to giving the opponent a command. With her current level and the opponent's strength, after completing this "command," there should be no further influence.

Calm down, Xia Ge, calm down.

Xia Ge slowly calmed down.

That was stunning at first sight.

Chu Yao tried to speak in her gentlest voice, wanting to take another look, but it turned into a command as she spoke, "You, open your eyes for me."

Although she wanted to take a look, she couldn't help but think of everything that happened to her chest last night when she saw the dwarf's face...

Thinking of everything that happened last night...

Chu Yao: "..."

She couldn't be gentle anymore.

Xia Ge: "..."

She's not stupid!

Seeing that she didn't answer, Chu Yao tried to coax her with patience, "Open your eyes, I'll show you a magic trick."

Chu Yao thought that she was just a child, no matter how mischievous.

Xia Ge: "..."

Hey... can this kind of idiotic conversation only fool children?
She just tricked the six-year-old girl in her arms three seconds ago, but the little girl still hasn't realized it yet.

But it doesn't matter, whether she's lying with her eyes open or closed, she's the best at it!

Xia Ge: "Sister... you're so handsome! But when you flew over with your cloak just now, it seemed to have hit my eyes... I'm blinded by your handsomeness and can't open my eyes..."

... The cloak hit her eyes? Blinded by her handsomeness?

What kind of nonsense is this?

Before Chu Yao could reply, Li Liu suddenly shouted, "Dangerous--"

There were many demonic puppets attacking the village this time, but in Chu Yao's eyes, they were all useless.

"Forget it." Chu Yao couldn't care less about the guy who was talking nonsense with his mouth full, as she saw the puppets rushing towards her recklessly. With a skilled hand, she drew a beautiful sword flower with her long sword. She reached out and rubbed the head of the little girl who was staring blankly in Xia Ge's arms, and her gaze unintentionally swept over the blue hairband tied in a bun on the other person's head. "Never mind that shorty, but you better watch closely. I rarely perform magic tricks for others to see--"

The little girl with empty eyes looked at the demonic puppets rushing towards Chu Yao as if she were looking at insurmountable peaks. Her pupils shrank to the size of a needle, and for a moment, despair filled her eyes.

Chu Yao turned her head, smiled brightly at the girl, revealing her sharp tiger teeth. Her shallow brown almond eyes sparkled in the last rays of the setting sun. "Remember, this trick is called--"

The girl raised the tip of her sword slightly and aimed it at the group of demonic puppets rushing towards her, and lightly slashed!

"Stab--"

All the puppets stopped moving.

Xia Ge closed her eyes. Although she didn't know what had happened, in her state of "Soul Snatching," she was particularly sensitive to the soul fire of the puppets. At this moment, the soul fire of all the puppets had been extinguished.

Xia Ge's calm and composed expression cracked for a moment.

... She had thought that the reinforcements from Jianfeng would be handsome and strong.

But she didn't expect them to be so strong!

A suffocating silence fell.

Countless sickles were swept away by the sword aura, and the rolling killing intent swept around!

Under the infinite sunset glow, amidst the wanton sword aura, the girl's voice was faintly tinged with laughter and vitality.

"One sword, break the He Shan."
The sword qi that broke through the air was so dangerous that it sent shivers down one's spine. Li Liu and the outer disciples who were watching all instinctively took a step back. The puppets rushing towards them all stopped in their tracks, their sickles falling from their hands. As soon as Chu Yao finished speaking, their bodies instantly shattered into pieces.

The broken puppet monsters lay on the ground, their bodies shattered by the sword qi effortlessly. The sickles that had been cut by the sword light flew away. Mixed with the last rays of the setting sun, they gradually condensed into a light in the hollow eyes of the girl with the bun on her head, piercing through the endless darkness and bringing the dawn of hope.

"... "

After a suffocating silence, the villagers' bewildered voices could be heard. "... Is it over?"

"It's over!!"

"Chu Daren is truly worthy of the title of the Sword Edge!!"

"No wonder... even if the others didn't come, it wouldn't matter, with Chu Daren alone, it's enough!"

"Just one sword..."

"Chu Daren's famous One Sword Breaking Mountains and Rivers has reached this level of mastery? Congratulations!"

"What a powerful strength! Chu Daren is definitely the leader of this Sword Edge Quest! The title of Sword Edge's top disciple is within reach!"

"Truly a hero among young people!"

...

Li Liu looked at the green-haired boy who was still crouching on the ground, holding the little girl tightly. In a daze, he uttered the words he had not finished saying earlier.

"But..."

"You're just a child too."

However, the other person obviously couldn't hear his explanation.

He closed his eyes and withdrew his complicated thoughts, only to remember that he had been stepping on something just now.

Looking down, Li Liu realized that he had inadvertently stepped on a half-wrapped oil-paper pancake. The golden pancake was already covered in mud and dirt, and he had accidentally stepped on it twice due to nervousness...

It was a bit... unsightly.

This pancake seemed to...

But before he could think further, he suddenly heard a scream, "Ah!"
Li Liu was startled by the sudden call and looked up to see the green-haired boy holding a little girl with a face full of despair.

"What the hell, where's my pancake?!!!" he exclaimed.
