Chapter 132: A Ten-Year Promise

The sun was setting over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the vast expanse of the sea. The sound of waves crashing against the shore was the only thing that could be heard in the peaceful silence.

Standing on the beach, Liang Chen looked out into the distance, his eyes fixed on the setting sun. He had come here to fulfill a promise he had made ten years ago.

Ten years ago, Liang Chen had met a girl named Xiaoyu on this very beach. They had spent a wonderful summer together, exploring the island and enjoying each other's company. But when the summer ended, Xiaoyu had to return to her hometown, and Liang Chen had to go back to his busy life in the city.

Before they parted ways, Xiaoyu had made Liang Chen promise that he would return to this beach ten years later, on the same day, at the same time. Liang Chen had agreed, thinking it was just a playful promise made between two young lovers.

But as the years went by, Liang Chen couldn't forget about Xiaoyu. He had tried to find her, but she had disappeared without a trace. He had almost given up hope of ever seeing her again, until he received a letter from her a few months ago.

In the letter, Xiaoyu had reminded Liang Chen of the promise he had made ten years ago. She had asked him to come back to the beach, to fulfill that promise, and to finally be reunited.

And so, here he was, standing on the beach, waiting for Xiaoyu to arrive. He didn't know what to expect, but he knew that he had to keep his promise. He had waited ten long years for this moment, and he wasn't going to let anything stop him from seeing Xiaoyu again.
