The fact is that although the underground pearl pit was a bit of a letdown, it still had some practical value.

After a moment of darkness, Xia Ge crawled out from underground, covered in dirt and looking like a carrot that had just been dug out.

She dusted herself off and muttered, "This thing isn't very useful..."

The system replied, "Just make do with it."

A gentle breeze blew past, and a few peach blossoms floated down. Xia Ge looked up and was immediately captivated by the sea of peach blossoms surrounding her.

She asked, "Where am I?"

The system couldn't answer her, so Xia Ge wandered around for a bit and eventually stumbled upon a small village.

The scene was idyllic, with criss-crossing paths, barking dogs, and clucking chickens. A group of women were washing clothes by the stream.

Xia Ge felt relieved, knowing that she had left the territory of the demonic cult.

The system suggested, "Why don't you go to Chang'an first..."

Xia Ge shook her head and said, "I'll ask around here first."

The village was called Peach Blossom Village, and the locals were all dressed in simple clothing. Xia Ge approached a woman washing clothes by the river and asked for directions.

The woman had a thick accent but was friendly. "You're not from around here, are you? This is Peach Blossom Village. If you want to go to Chang'an, it's quite far... but judging from your attire..."

Xia Ge had originally looked like a carrot dug out from the mud, but now she was dressed in a black gown that made her look elegant and refined.

Peach Blossom Village... the name sounded familiar, but Xia Ge couldn't quite remember. She thought for a moment and then asked, "Do you have any houses for rent here?"

The system asked, "What are you planning to do?"

Xia Ge looked out at the sea of peach blossoms and the overlapping mountains and smiled. "I think this place has good feng shui."

It was no worse than the Peach Blossom Spring described by Tao Yuanming.
Suitable for retirement.

The system was a bit frustrated: "Are you still thinking about retirement now?"

The village woman's eyes lit up when she heard this: "There aren't many outsiders coming here, and we have empty houses in our family..."

Xia Ge went to see the house. It was an idle small courtyard that was well cleaned and not small. It seemed to belong to the village woman's brother, but he hadn't had a chance to get married yet. He was bitten by a tiger while hunting in the mountains and had his leg bitten off. He came down with a limp leg, and the wound became infected. He died in a few days.

Talking about this sad story, the village woman was a little envious, "Don't worry about it being unlucky. Our brother is in this house..."

"Ah, that's not a problem. How much is the rent?" Xia Ge quickly changed the subject to avoid making the other person feel uncomfortable and asked about the price.

The village woman hesitated a bit, seemingly unsure of how much to say.

In fact, asking the price was just a casual question. Xia Ge had not gone down the mountain for a long time and had not bought a house before. Seeing the other person's expression, she thought for a moment, took a bag of spirit stones and gave it to her. The other person was shocked when she saw it, "We can't take advantage of others like this! Little girl, you can live in this house for free!"

She thought it was too valuable to accept.

Xia Ge was embarrassed. She did have some small change on her, but it was really small... just a few copper coins here and there. Occasionally, she would buy a sugar-coated haw or a baked cake at the foot of the mountain. Her senior sisters usually took care of the big items. Moreover, the things she wanted to buy were usually purchased directly from the black market with spirit stones.

Money was really something she hadn't seen in a long time.

Seeing Xia Ge's dilemma, the village woman said, "How about this, I'll sell you this small place. My family makes wine, and I'll send you a few pots of our own brewed peach blossom wine later..."

Xia Ge quickly agreed. The other person then took two of the spirit stones from the bag and returned the rest to her. After signing the land deed and house deed, the transaction was finally completed.

"This place is really cheap to buy a house," Xia Ge thought.

The system asked, "Why did you buy this house?"

After putting away the things, Xia Ge looked at the overlapping mountains outside and said melancholy, "...You have to fight to get your loved ones back, but you also have to think about where to put them."

As the witch who was hated by everyone, she couldn't just wander around with the Chu family's noble daughter, could she?

Going back to the Demon Sect was even more ridiculous.

The system said, "Hey, don't you have a luxurious mansion?"

Xia Ge replied, "This is called being prepared for the worst!"

The system said, "..."
After leaving Peach Blossom Village, Xia Ge used a teleportation array to head straight to Chang'an.

Little did she know that as soon as she landed, before she even had a chance to figure out which way the door to the Chu family's house opened, she heard a lot of commotion in the streets.

Among the noise was news of the eldest daughter of the Chu family getting married in half a month, but what was even more talked about was the disappearance of a senior disciple from Lingxi Danfeng.

In her past life, at Lingxi Peak, Xia Wushuang taught puppetry very casually, but also took in a few elite closed-door disciples.

"Closed-door disciples must have closed doors," Xia Wushuang said while teaching these disciples. So while she taught, Gu Peijiu stood outside the door, listening to Xia Wushuang's lazy voice coming from behind the not-so-tightly-closed stone door.

She loved listening to her voice, whether it was casual, serious, or joking.

But as she listened, the voice suddenly stopped.

An uncertain voice of a disciple rang out, "Master, you..."

Followed by a scream of agony, "Ah - Master, Master, what happened to you -"

Gu Peijiu's eyes turned cold, and the next moment she broke down the door! Without even thinking, she snatched the white-clothed person's sword and then pressed them down hard on the ground!

Xia Wushuang, with her blood-red pupils, struggled fiercely and the closed-door disciples she had taken in were all frightened, standing in place with no color on their faces.

Gu Peijiu skillfully knocked the person unconscious, then looked up at the disciples, not saying a word, but with a cold light in her eyes.

The male disciple who was first pressed down by Xia Wushuang was so frightened that his face turned pale, clutching his clothes over his chest, almost crying, "I, I..."

Gu Peijiu withdrew her gaze and said faintly, "No one is allowed to speak of this. From today on, the sect leader will be in seclusion."
"Wait, Sect Leader, what's happening?" 

Anyone who could be considered a disciple of the sect leader Xia Wushuang was not foolish. After the initial shock, someone quickly regained their senses and asked, "What's wrong with the Sect Leader?" 

Gu Peijiu picked up the person and said calmly, "He's possessed by demonic energy." 

Several people looked at each other in confusion. 

Gu Peijiu's footsteps quickened. 

... It was getting worse and worse. 

It was already broad daylight, but if one was conscious, they could directly sense the calamity that was about to take them. 

They couldn't let it go on any longer. 

- - 

When Xia Wushuang woke up, she felt a little groggy. 

She was lying in a small cave she recognized as the one she often used to repair puppets. Before, it was messy and scattered with things, but now it was clean and tidy. She rubbed her temples, feeling a headache coming on, and then saw the white-clad puppet. 

"How did I get here?" Xia Wushuang asked naturally. 

Gu Peijiu looked at her and said, "... You were too tired." 

Xia Wushuang rubbed her temples. "I see..." 

"Hey, I seem to have been telling them something just now..." Xia Wushuang's short-circuited brain suddenly remembered this matter and she quickly got out of bed, not even realizing that she was wearing a new set of undergarments. "I have to finish telling them the precautions." 

She changed her clothes, put on her weapon, and walked out confidently. Gu Peijiu wanted to say something, but after thinking about it, she didn't. 

She thought that with her following behind, there shouldn't be any problems. 

However, as soon as Xia Wushuang walked out into the warm sunlight, the blood-red amaryllis flower on her clothes bloomed, her blood-red pupils flashed, and she disappeared in an instant! 

Gu Peijiu's pupils shrank! 

She was deceived! 

The calamity had learned to be cunning!
Fortunately, Xia Wushuang's physical fitness was no match for Gu Peiju, and she was quickly caught before she could cause any trouble.

Xia Wushuang, with her blood-red pupils, laughed sinisterly, "You can't do anything to me--"

Gu Peiju remained silent and brought her back to the cave. She carefully drew a formation and then tore off the curse on Xia Wushuang's body, causing the curse to laugh terrifyingly. Xia Wushuang widened her blood-red pupils and said, "You like me..."

Gu Peiju didn't hesitate and said, "As you wish, okay?"

Before Gu Peiju could react, she felt a warm and soft sensation on her lips. She saw Xia Wushuang's pupils gradually lose their blood-red color, and she understood what the curse wanted to do. However, she seemed to be possessed and couldn't move, holding onto a piece of clothing tightly.

It was as if she had lost the ability to think.

Xia Wushuang quickly regained her senses, and her vacant pupils gradually focused. When she realized what she was doing, her pupils widened.

She wanted to push Gu Peiju away but found herself tied up tightly, her clothes scattered in pieces. Gu Peiju held a piece of her clothes in her hand, the culprit without a doubt.

Xia Wushuang instinctively wanted to retreat, but Gu Peiju's gaze darkened. When she saw Xia Wushuang trying to retreat, she did not hesitate to press her down on the bed and deepen the kiss.

It was as if they were desperately entangled.

...She absolutely, positively couldn't let her know what happened!

Thinking of the curse's words before, "As you wish," Gu Peiju's gaze became heavy.

She wouldn't let it happen as it wished.

Xia Wushuang's mind went blank, and she couldn't understand how things had suddenly turned out this way.

"Um...you...let go...um."

Xia Wushuang struggled hard, her mind slowly recovering some sanity. She gasped for breath, and Gu Peiju looked at her.

"You...let me go." Xia Wushuang was still in a panic, struggling hard, even forgetting that she still had her "verbal spirit."

Of course, even if she had her "verbal spirit," it would be of no use to Gu Peiju.

Gu Peiju did not move, only whispered, "I'm sorry."
Summer Wushuang, who was inexplicably tied up and kissed, opened her eyes wide, her brain was confused for a while before she realized what had happened.

"I told you to let go of me! Ajiu!" 

The word "Ajiu" sounded particularly heartbreaking.

But Gu Peijiu still didn't move.

"Why?!" Summer Wushuang said, "You are my leader, I-"

"I have always believed in you!"

The system said that as long as the puppet trusts its master absolutely, the puppets will also give their master absolute loyalty and trust.

Why?

Summer Wushuang couldn't figure out why things had turned out this way. But now is not a good time to think about reasons while being tied up-

She gritted her teeth and said word by word, "I command you to let go of me!"

Gu Peijiu still didn't move.

Summer Wushuang collapsed: "Why aren't you moving?"

She just used the power of language.

"Because I am a puppet with emotions." Gu Peijiu didn't look at her, she looked at the Wenqing sword hanging on the wall, her voice calm and without waves, "I... fell in love with you."

"I don't want to keep watching your back all the time." Gu Peijiu said, "I want you to be mine."

"What are you joking about?!" Summer Wushuang panicked.

But Gu Peijiu's expression was calm, without any waves, "I have already told everyone that you are in closed-door cultivation and will not come out for three years."

"Ajiu!!" Summer Wushuang instinctively wanted to summon the puppet, but then she realized that she had given all her power to her leader.

They had been together for ten years. Even if Summer Wushuang lost a penny on the road, Gu Peijiu could quietly put that penny back without anyone noticing.

Summer Wushuang collapsed and shouted, "Achan!!"
Gu Peijiu lowered his head and kissed her lips. After a while, he whispered, "I will take good care of you."

On the first day, Xia Wushuang said, "I don't believe you will do that, you must..."

Gu Peijiu remained silent and looked at her.

On the second day, Xia Wushuang stared blankly at her Wenzhen sword.

She didn't even know that sometimes she would suddenly become a disaster, and then be suppressed by Gu Peijiu without any surprise.

The disaster sneered, "You won't get anything."

Gu Peijiu said expressionlessly, "It doesn't matter."

She didn't know what to do, so she could only struggle like a trapped animal.

She thought she would always find a way, before she found a way...

On the third day, Su Chan came and sneered, "Let her go."

Gu Peijiu said, "It's impossible."

Su Chan said, "Doing this will only make her hate you, it's meaningless. I'm happy to see you destroy yourself, but I don't want to see you torture her like a monster."

Gu Peijiu said, "I won't."

Su Chan looked at her for a while and then smiled, "Do you know what it feels like to be locked up in a place?"

She slowly said, "The whole world is the same..."

"...Freedom and desire."

"At that time, whoever can save her."

"Whoever is her god."

The next day, Xia Wushuang pointed to the Wenzhen sword on the wall and said, "I really like that sword."

Gu Peijiu silently handed her the sword.

Her chest was ruthlessly pierced by the blade.
No sense of pain.

Gu Peiju looked at her.

Xia Wushuang said expressionlessly, "There's something in my heart that I just can't let go."

She threw her sword aside and sat against the wall, hugging her knees in silence.

"...You're definitely hiding something from me," Xia Wushuang said. "I know you wouldn't suddenly have a brain malfunction."

"..."

Gu Peiju picked up the sword she threw and casually asked, "What do you want to eat?"

Xia Wushuang said in a muffled voice, "It's been ten years."

Gu Peiju suggested, "Mushroom soup?"

Xia Wushuang really liked the mushroom soup from the mountain, she had it eight out of ten times.

Xia Wushuang said in a low voice, "I know, if you like a girl...you wouldn't use these methods to show your affection for her."

Gu Peiju's movements of hanging the sword on the stone wall stiffened slightly.

"..."

Xia Wushuang said, "You said you like me, but you treat me like this, I think it's unfair."

Her voice was a little sad.

Gu Peiju's body stiffened.

She could imagine her crying, saying something vicious, or stabbing her like she did just now, and she had the ability to defend herself against those things.

But in this state, Gu Peiju was at a loss.

In the end, she didn't say anything, just found a puppet to keep watch, and left.

"...You could have told me if you had something to deal with, I trust you so much." Xia Wushuang spoke to the wall, not realizing that the other person had already left, "They say one sword can erase all enmity, and I just gave you back that sword...I don't care if the language fails, and I don't care about those things, and if you like me, I'm not...disliking you very much."

Couldn't they just talk calmly? What was all this about?
She's not a young girl in her teens anymore, she's already a mature woman in her twenties.

She shut her mouth, feeling like she had poured her heart out but there was still no response. She quietly turned her head to look and saw two puppets standing by the door, grinning foolishly at her.

Xia Wushuang: "..."

Xia Wushuang turned silently, facing the wall and holding her breath. Finally, she pounded the wall fiercely.

Damn it.

What a sulky person!

So angry.

When Gu Peiju returned, Xia Wushuang was squatting in the corner, pretending to be a mushroom.

Gu Peiju: "...let's eat."

Xia Wushuang: "I have no appetite, I won't eat."

Gu Peiju was a little disappointed and said, "If you don't want to see me, I'll leave."

She put the plate on the exquisite redwood table.

The little cave was decorated nicely. Gu Peiju brought the Yishen beads that kept the room cool in summer and warm in winter, and there were soft blankets on the floor. If you turned left after walking fifty meters, there was a guest room, and if you turned right, there was a small kitchen. Xia Wushuang really didn't know when she had quietly made all these arrangements without hearing any noise.

Seeing that Gu Peiju was about to leave, Xia Wushuang pouted and said, "You really like me that much, huh?"

Gu Peiju: "..."

Xia Wushuang: "Why don't you show some sincerity? Do you understand that?"

Seeing her squatting in the corner with a gloomy expression, Gu Peiju felt sorry for her, but also scolded herself for being a jerk. She put the mushroom soup on the table, walked over, picked her up, and put her on the soft bed. She whispered, "I understand."

Xia Wushuang's eyes suddenly turned slightly red, and the next moment, she bit her sharp teeth on Gu Peiju's neck!

The white sacrificial robe suddenly changed, blooming into brilliant amaryllis. Gu Peiju remained calm and pulled off her clothes with ease.
The ominous voice said, "Don't think that you can do whatever you want to me..."

Gu Peijiu said, "I will always find a way."

Pausing for a moment, she whispered, "You won't be able to be so arrogant for long, you trash."

Hearing this, the ominous voice chuckled softly, "Just wait, someday..."

Before it finished speaking, its clothes were already torn to shreds, revealing the perfect curves of a woman's body. Gu Peijiu's face turned red and she quickly covered the person with a blanket.

After the ominous voice disappeared, Xia Wushuang remained asleep, seeming to be exhausted.

Gu Peijiu covered her with a blanket, tasted the mushroom soup she made and found it a bit cold.

Maybe she should make something else.

Osmanthus cake would be nice.

As she thought about it, she put down the soup and unexpectedly saw Su Chan when she opened the door.

"What are you here for?" Gu Peijiu said in a calm voice.

"I want to see her," Su Chan said, seeming determined to achieve her goal.

"She's resting," Gu Peijiu said.

Su Chan snorted at Gu Peijiu's words, "I have something important to tell her."

As she spoke, she looked Gu Peijiu up and down - Gu Peijiu knew what she was thinking.

She was probably wondering how she could compete with her. As a puppet master, Xia Wushuang's most proud creation, Gu Peijiu's strength was almost at the level of a celestial being, or even close to a god. Su Chan, as a fallen god, was weaker. If the two fought, it would be difficult to determine a winner.

Su Chan also knew that there was little chance of winning by force, so she discreetly assessed the situation before withdrawing her gaze and saying, "I want to talk about something else."

"What is it?" Gu Peijiu asked.

Su Chan said, "Something happened to the puppets." 

Gu Peijiu furrowed her brows slightly, "What happened?"
"Do you know about the puppets that participated in the war before?" 

"...Their souls have all disappeared from the puppets." Su Chan paused. "Or to put it another way, those souls couldn't withstand the high intensity of the puppets, but they couldn't enter the cycle of reincarnation either, so they wander around in the world like that." 

Without thinking, Gu Peijiu looked back and felt relieved when she heard the other person breathing peacefully as if asleep. She sent two small puppets to guard and said, "Let's talk outside." 

She asked Su Chan, "Who else knows about these things?" 

"The war has basically ended, and those puppets that should have gone home have gone home, so..." Su Chan looked at her, "So..." 

Gu Peijiu looked at her and suddenly smiled. 

Puppets don't age or die. With this smile, her black eyes were bright and her voice was light and breezy. She said, "But you, Su Chan, care about the life and death of those below?" 

Her voice carried a hint of mockery, "A good excuse." 

Su Chan also laughed. The smile of the red-clothed girl was enchanting and bright, and her voice softened, "Of course I don't care." 

"But as you said...someone will care." 

She suddenly leaned closer to Gu Peijiu, her smile hiding malice, "What if you don't tell her, but she finds out about these things herself? Will she still call you Ah Jiu?" 

Gu Peijiu stepped back, her gaze cold, "What does that have to do with you?" 

"Or, you choose to tell her about this." Su Chan casually stepped back, her smile carrying a hint of malice and sarcasm, "After all...what you want to protect is her world." 

Gu Peijiu's face was expressionless. 

Su Chan knew that staying here wouldn't lead to any results. Gu Peijiu wouldn't let her see Xia Wushuang, but her goal was already halfway accomplished, so she didn't stay any longer. 

When Gu Peijiu went back, Xia Wushuang had woken up and was standing by the stone wall with her hands behind her back, looking seriously at her Ask Love Sword. 

The Ask Love Sword was cold to the touch, and there were complex patterns carved on the blade. She reached out to touch it and saw Gu Peijiu come in. She said, "I remember that you seemed to have carved something on it." 

She turned her head, "My formation skills are not good, and I haven't figured out what it is after studying it for a long time." 

Gu Peijiu was stunned and didn't know why she suddenly remembered that she hadn't made the osmanthus cake she wanted to make, and looked at the mushroom soup on the table...it was gone. 

Even though no one fed Xia Wushuang, she still drank all the soup by herself. 

Seeing Gu Peijiu looking at the soup, Xia Wushuang pretended to be nonchalant and shifted her gaze to the sword, "...What are these patterns for?"
"It's used to suppress calamities," she said.

A faint smile appeared on Gu Peijiu's lips.

"Don't you think it's beautiful?" She asked softly.

The sword was exquisitely crafted, with every detail lifelike. It was evident that the person who carved it had put a lot of effort into it.

Xia Wushuang made a sound of agreement. "It's quite beautiful."

After a moment of silence, Xia Wushuang either remembered her own predicament or something else entirely. She paused and said, "You went through a lot of trouble."

Gu Peijiu replied, "It's good as long as you like it."

Her previously gloomy mood, brought on by Su Chan's words, seemed to brighten up.

Gu Peijiu thought to herself that it was alright. She could protect this person well.

...Definitely.

Xia Wushuang touched the sword and said, "Keeping this sword seems to be meaningless."

Gu Peijiu said, "Keep it."

Xia Wushuang stared at the sword for a while before shaking his head. "I'll give it to you."

Youthful friendships will eventually fade away like water flowing downstream.

The girl who once watched peach blossoms with her was now the powerful King of Chu.

As for her...it was time to let go.
