"Haha, what a joke!" Ye Ze sneered, "The play of a thief calling for the capture of a thief is enough once, but another time is nauseating."

"This Sky Radiance is made by my master Ye Bucai of the Ye family. It has been passed down from generation to generation in my family. My father trusted you and accidentally revealed this clothing when he was drinking with you. You, this despicable and shameless old man, coveted the clothing and even conspired with the Demon Cult to destroy my entire family!" 

As Ye Ze spoke, his eyes turned red. "You are a disgrace to my family with such a thief among us!"

The crowd's gaze towards Chang Ren suddenly changed! But there were also people shouting, "Stop talking nonsense. Chang Ren has always been upright in his actions. Without evidence, stop spouting nonsense!"

"I even said that you stole the Sky Radiance from the Chang family!"

"With thieves like you in the Ye family, you are also a disgrace!"

"..."

Seeing so many people speaking, Chang Ren calmed down for a moment and said, "You speak without any evidence, don't just make baseless accusations."

"Baseless accusations?" Ye Ze sneered. "The clothing has a spirit, and the Sky Radiance recognizes me as its master. That is the best proof!"

Chang Ren laughed loudly and reversed black and white, "Stop it. The Sky Radiance has no owner. Anyone can make it recognize them as its master!"

There were only five ancient clothing spirits in the world, so naturally, the people did not understand the true ancient clothing spirits. When they heard Chang Ren's words and looked at Ye Ze again, they completely looked at him with disdainful eyes as a thief.

Someone said, "Since you are a member of the Ye family, do you have any evidence?"

When the Ye family was destroyed, Ye Ze wandered around and lost the jade pendant that could prove his identity. Where would he get evidence? Ye Ze was not afraid and said directly, "No! This clothing is the evidence!"

Everyone laughed.

Chang Ren chuckled, paused, and then insincerely said, "Today is a happy day for the child. I don't want to see any red. If you take off the Sky Radiance and return it to the Chang family now, we can overlook the past for the sake of our past relationship with the Ye family."

Ye Ze was not moved at all, and the rolling pressure emitted by the ancient clothing spirit became even more intense!

Chang Ren sneered, "If you don't want to drink the toast, you will have to drink the punishment. Don't blame me for not showing mercy!"

"The clothing is evidence? Isn't the clothing the evidence that you stole?!"

"There is no evidence, stop spouting nonsense!"

"Hand over the Sky Radiance!"

"Where did this little thief pretending to be a member of the Ye family come from? Don't be fooled by him, Master Chang!"
Chang Renxu insincerely said, "Based on the relationship between the Ye family and the Chang family back then, this young master can come to me for a celebratory drink after returning the Skyshine."

People around them gathered and said, "Who is he to deserve it? Quickly hand over the clothes!"

Ye Ze's gaze was icy, and his spiritual power shook as he exploded with a burst of aura, sending the people surrounding him flying!

The people surrounding them were all vassal families of the Ye family, and the truly powerful ones were just watching from the other side, so Ye Ze didn't have to exert much effort. He pointed at Chang Ren and said, "Since you don't believe me, there's no need for evidence. I'm here to take your head, Chang the thief!"

Chang Ren sneered, "You're asking for it! Shameless little thief, stop using a chicken feather as a commanding sword. Do you really think you can unleash the power of the Skyshine?"

As soon as he finished speaking, a heavenly pressure suddenly spread out. Ye Ze's hand holding the sword trembled slightly, but his gaze became even more resolute. The power of the Skyshine surged forth, and the air almost became tangible, carrying an extremely violent aura.

The two of them were actually at a stalemate!

Ye Ze's Skyshine was made by the Ye family's ancestor Ye Bucai himself, so he naturally had an affinity for the Ye family's bloodline. Coupled with the favor of the heavens, although Ye Ze only had the power of the Earth level, he was not inferior to Chang Ren!

Because of the previous incident with the heroes' order, the Chang family's grand wedding seemed lively, but in reality, many of the heroes were just there to join in the fun. The current situation was complicated, and the truth was unclear. There weren't many people who were truly willing to help the Chang family.

The families who had good relations with the Ye family nearby couldn't bear to watch any longer and were about to draw their swords when they heard a light laugh.

"What are you all doing on such a lively day?"

The girl's voice was crisp and clear, but it was incredibly distinct in this situation.

Everyone's gaze was attracted to her and looked towards the source of the sound.

They saw a group of coolly dressed maidservants surrounding a person at the entrance. The person was wearing a furry cloak and a light blue silk skirt, which made her skin look as white and tender as fresh snow. She had tinkling ornaments at her waist, and her almond-shaped eyes were dark and spirited. She walked slowly and elegantly, with a faint fragrance lingering in the air.

She was truly as beautiful as a flower.

Everyone couldn't help but make way for her.

"Who is she?"

"It seems to be the new head of the Chu family."

"I've never heard of her before, but seeing her today, I didn't expect her to be so beautiful..."

Ye Ze was stunned when Chu Yi arrived, and Chang Ren took advantage of the opportunity to exert his force, and the pressure suddenly became heavier. Ye Ze's pupils shrank, and his body swayed slightly, but that strong pressure disappeared in an instant.
The butterflies fluttered gracefully, shielding Ye Ze from the pressure. Chu Yi slowly walked up to Ye Ze, looked at him for a while, and said, "As expected..."

When she was at Chu's house before, she couldn't see anything. But as she got closer to Chang's house, she gradually began to see things. And just now, when she spoke, she regained her sight completely. As long as she was close to Ye Ze, her eyes would recover. So... this was the reason why that person had tried so hard back then.

Chu Yi quietly thought about it. As she thought about that person whom she could never reach, she felt a little sour for some reason... But it didn't matter anymore. She had lost, and that was that. No matter what she did, she would always lose. So she had to win this battle beautifully.

Ye Ze didn't understand what she meant and frowned at her. "You..."

Chang Ren saw that his pressure had been blocked and stopped. He looked at Chu Yi and his smile seemed a bit fake. "My in-law has come?!"

"In-law?" Chu Yi looked at him with a faint smile on her lips, her voice cold and indifferent. "Master Chang is exaggerating. As a humble person like me, how can I climb up to a prestigious family like Chang's?"

As soon as she said this, there was an uproar in the crowd. Everyone looked at each other in confusion. "Did the new master of Chu's family come here to break off the engagement in person?"

"To break off the engagement in person? This is..."

"...!"

Chang Ren clenched his fists, but his expression remained unchanged, still with a shallow smile. "What do you mean, in-law?"

Although he had expected Chu's family to withdraw from the engagement, Chang Ren did not expect Chu Yi to be so decisive and say it in front of everyone. It was really hard to accept. Someone whispered next to him, "As far as I know, both young masters are not here. Chang's eldest son is already on his way to pick up the bride. Chu's family's actions..."

"..."
Chang Ren felt that he couldn't save face anymore.

"The reason I've already said," Chu Yi's smile remained unchanged, "The Chang family is a prestigious family, and my Chu family cannot climb up to your level."

Chang Ren's voice became slightly colder, "Please clarify your words, Master Chu."

Chu Yi sighed lightly, "Are you sure you want me to say it here?"

"Say it! Why not!"

"What's wrong with saying it!" 

"Although the Chu family is a hundred-year-old royal family, you can't speak like this. This is too much!" Someone nearby couldn't beat Ye Ze, but had a close relationship with the Chang family. He missed the opportunity to stop Ye Ze earlier, but now it was a good chance to perform, so he shouted.

Chang Ren had done too many guilty things and felt uneasy at the words, but facing the crowd's clamor, he couldn't directly refuse and lose face. He hesitated and said, "My Chang family is upright and honest. Master Chu, please say it to my face."

Ye Ze glanced at Chu Yi, wanting to speak but hesitated.

Chu Yi had no expression and glanced at Ye Ze before saying to the crowd, "I believe everyone heard what this junior brother said earlier."

Chang Ren's heart tightened slightly.

The voice of calamity sounded in his ear, "Why so nervous..."

Chang Ren's heart eased slightly, and when he looked around at the people, his gaze gradually became deep.

Everyone looked around, not saying a word. After all, they were all here to attend the Chang family's wedding banquet. It wouldn't be good to lose the Chang family's face. After a moment of silence, a man spoke up, "We heard it."

This word broke the silence, and people around began to speak, "But this little thief has no proof of his identity from the Ye family. He has nothing. How can we believe what he said?"

"Yeah, that's right..."

Chu Yi withdrew his gaze and looked at Chang Ren, "I can prove that he is the orphan of the Ye family."

As soon as these words were spoken, after the people exchanged glances, the man spoke again, "Master Chu means that everything this young man just said is true?"

Chu Yi nodded slightly, "Yes, it is true."

"Clap!"
The sound of the ceramic tea cup shattering on the ground was crisp and clear. Chang Ren suddenly stood up and exclaimed, "Is the head of the Chu family here to spout blood at people?!"
