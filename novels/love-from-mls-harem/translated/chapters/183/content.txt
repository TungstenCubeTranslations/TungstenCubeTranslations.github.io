Soon she regained her senses, rubbing her temples and feeling a bit strange.

But people often had such experiences, occasionally feeling like they had experienced a scene before. Whether it had actually happened or not, that might just be another universe's affair.

Xia Ge couldn't help but think of the "past life" that the system had mentioned, feeling inexplicably amused.

But there was also an indescribable joy.

Did she have a senior sister in her past life too?

That would be really great.

If she had a past life... and her senior sister had always been there in her past life, she must have been very happy.

She thought.

The system thought she was in a bad mood and cautiously knocked on her, "Do you want to go in and take a look?"

Only then did Xia Ge come back to her senses. The real wind was a bit cold, and she hesitated for a moment before saying in a hoarse voice, "Yeah, let's go."

She flipped off the roof and carefully slipped in.

As soon as she stepped into the hall, a rich spiritual energy hit her face, so thick that it almost confused all her senses. Even Xia Ge, who had never encountered such a thick and almost substantial spiritual energy before, took a while to recover.

The whole Yangxin Hall was very dark, without any candles lit, only the gathering spirit array underfoot was shining, and the thick spiritual energy was almost substantial. The whole hall was filled with fine mist, and Xia Ge could only vaguely see the gathering spirit array under her feet and the ice jade soul bed not far away.

Gu Peijiu was lying quietly on the soul bed, her soft clothes hanging down, the ice jade soul bed exuding bursts of cold air, which set off her cold and beautiful eyebrows and eyes, and her icy skin and jade bones.

Xia Ge touched her senior sister's forehead.

It was very cold.

Tianzhuling felt the breath of a person, and sensitively slipped out of Gu Peijiu's sleeve. But sensing Xia Ge, it lazily shook a few times, as if greeting her, and then shrank back.

But it was grabbed by Xia Ge.

Tianzhuling shook a bit, but didn't resist, and obediently wrapped around Xia Ge's fingertips.

The young girl wore a black robe, a fox mask on her face, and her expression was unclear. The exquisitely embroidered cloud pattern on her waistband moved without wind. At this moment, both Zhenhun and Tianzhuling, the two ancient demons, faintly showed strange fluctuations, like resonance, but also seemed to be something else.

Xia Ge's voice was low and gentle, "Senior sister, I may... need to go to the demonic sect."
Antidote.

After waiting for so long, with a glimmer of hope that the Wan Hun Dan would work, or something else...

She didn't know what that something else was, but she had a stubborn and uncertain feeling, like a fool - she felt that even without an antidote, her senior sister would wake up.

Xia Ge thought of the mysterious woman in the cloak she had seen at the Bai Meng Cave.

She had always felt that her senior sister would wake up.

At some inadvertent moment when she was not there.

She hoped that when her senior sister woke up, the first thing she would see would be her.

So, she kept waiting.

But several days had passed... what she had hoped for did not happen.

Xia Ge remembered Li Liu's words and her eyes dimmed slightly.

And she also learned about that kind of thing...

She tightened her grip on the Tian Zhu Ling, as if she could find some comfort that way.

Feeling Xia Ge's suppressed mood, the Tian Zhu Ling wriggled uneasily, then slowly pulled itself out of Gu Peiju's sleeve, ignoring the long red silk trailing behind it. It pulled on Xia Ge's clothes, lifting its tail high and gently rubbing her cheek.

The red silk was soft and seemed to carry the coolness of the Ice Jade Soul Bed, making Xia Ge's muddled mind calm down a bit.

"I don't know if this is right."

Xia Ge said, "Even if I... have blood on my hands and have committed heinous crimes..."

- I still hope... you will stand by my side.

As she spoke, she found it hard to continue and stood there dryly, silently swallowing the rest of her words.

She had not done what she had not done, but since she had accepted this body, she naturally had to accept everything it had been through.

Xia Ge clenched her fists slightly.

... she was unwilling.
"I am so unwilling!"

With the addition of the mysterious black spirit, the cloud pattern on the belt faintly changed, and the soft red silk wrapped around her body. Xia Ge looked at the red silk in her hand, afraid to look at her senior sister's calm face.

"..."

Xia Ge closed her eyes. "...Am I too greedy?"

The more greedy one is, the easier it is to be disappointed.

She was afraid of disappointment.

And even more afraid of her senior sister looking at her with disappointed eyes.

"..."

Xia Ge slowly released her hand, and the Tianzhu Ling unexpectedly fell to the ground. After reacting, it wrapped around Xia Ge's ankle like a carp. Xia Ge lowered her eyelashes, looked at the Tianzhu Ling wrapped around her ankle for a while, then lifted her head and looked at Gu Peiju.

Gu Peiju slept very peacefully, with delicate eyelashes and a faint frost gathering on them. Her red lips were still bright, contrasting with her cold white complexion.

"...It doesn't matter if you're disappointed." She murmured, "It doesn't matter what happens."

You need to wake up first.

Even if you're disappointed in her, you still need to look at her with beautiful disappointed eyes.

Don't always close your eyes.

It's so sad to look at you.

"We have a story in our place." Xia Ge said softly, "The story goes that if the princess sleeps too long, the prince will kiss her and wake her up."

"Afterwards, they lived happily ever after."

Xia Ge took off her mask, leaned down, and kissed Gu Peiju's lips.

- As long as you wake up well, nothing else matters.

Even if you're disappointed, you need to open your eyes and look at her.
"...... Xia Wuyin."

The voice of a young man suddenly sounded.

Xia Ge was suddenly startled and instinctively wanted to put on her mask. But the next moment, the sky suddenly lit up and the light of the Yangxin Palace was dazzling. The mask in Xia Ge's hand was knocked off and for a moment, she was surrounded by enemies.

Ye Ze stood quietly at the door, and people gradually came out around him.

There are actually people in the Yangxin Palace!?

It was only then that Xia Ge noticed that the huge gathering spirit formation under her feet was in the center of the Yangxin Palace, and other formations with hidden auras were densely painted around the periphery.

The strong and pure aura brought by the gathering spirit formation, combined with the formations, concealed the chaotic human aura. Because Xia Ge was upset and distracted, when she entered the palace, she was completely attracted by her senior sister and became careless!

"...... It's actually Xia Wuyin?"

"Why......"

"That just now was......"

"......"

Many people saw the scene where Xia Wuyin kissed Gu Peiju, and their expressions were different for a while.

There was a hidden gaze that was even sharper and more piercing.

But Xia Ge didn't have time to look. She instinctively went to pick up the mask that had fallen from her hand, but the next moment, her movement stopped.

A faint voice came into her ears, "This matter will pass."

"You and I, we don't owe each other anything, nor are we involved with each other."

...... Ye Ze.

Ye Ze looked at the stiff girl.

No matter how heartbroken she was, when the boy licked her quietly in the corner, and when the girl who sat on the wutong tree, shook the silver bell, and laughed innocently but said "don't even leave a dog behind" and killed two hundred people of the Ye family, and the boy who rushed into the evil spirit camp with a broken leg and hugged him regardless of everything, merged together.

What could he say?

What could he do?
He could only swallow all his blood and tears, and in the end, all the pain and unwillingness, despair and sadness, turned into his anger to move forward.

The enchanting voice of the girl echoed faintly in his ears, soft and shallow.

"What you see in your eyes is just a sword."

"...It is certainly hateful to stain the sword with blood, but isn't it even more hateful to be the person who wields the sword?"

Ye Ze looked at the "sword" in his eyes.

The girl bent down and made a motion as if she was picking up a mask, but she looked a bit stiff. The Town Soul outlined the girl's delicate lines, and the red silk fluttered on the ground, with one end wrapped around the girl's ankle and the other end wrapped around Gu Peijiu's wrist at some point.

If it weren't for Gu Peijiu lying behind them, Xia Wuyin and her, one black and one white, with the red silk bright and beautiful, would have been a perfect match.

The fox mask fell to the ground.

Ye Ze looked at Xia Wuyin and thought that if this was a sword, it should be the gentlest sword in the world.

After a while, Xia Ge slowly got up and looked at Ye Ze not far away.

He wasn't wearing the blue clothes that the top disciples of the Sword Peak usually wore, but a simple cloth, and he didn't even bring a sword. He was just like when he first entered the door, with a light cloth and a heart full of passion.

He looked at her with a calm gaze, without the anger he should have had.

"...Xia Wuyin."

He called her name again.

Very lightly.

As if nothing had happened, just like when he first came in.

Xia Ge still remembered that when this boy first entered the door, he was determined to become stronger, find out the truth, and avenge his family.

Later, he entered the inner gate of the Dan Peak one step ahead of her by relying on his own efforts, but every time he came down the mountain to see her, he would bring a lot of food and ask about her well-being, but he never wore the Dan Feng plain clothes of the inner disciples.

They had drunk and talked together, and had also had quarrels, but in the end, it was often Ye Ze who apologized first, although he didn't say anything, he would send food and drink to make up for it.

No matter how busy he was, when he saw her, he would always be like this, with a light cloth and a heart full of passion, as if nothing had ever changed.

The impulsive and irritable Ye Ze, the Ye Ze burdened with family hatred, a long time ago, was also a boy who would silently accompany her until dawn.
It's just fate playing tricks on people. The past seems like a world away.

The butterfly birthmark on her shoulder blade vaguely stings.

All the anger slowly dissipates into thin air. Xia Ge thinks to herself that she probably doesn't have the right to accuse Ye Ze of anything.

But she doesn't owe him anything either.

Xia Ge looks around at the people surrounding her. Chang Lan, the group from Jianfeng, Baili Qing, a group of unfamiliar people from Shoufeng, the group from Danfeng. She even sees Mao Qing and Bi Xi...

It's like they were all waiting for her here.

"I know it wasn't you," Ye Ze looks at her with an expressionless face, his eyes calm and even a little indifferent. "You wouldn't summon evil spirits."

He's trying to stand firm in the middle, neither in pain nor hesitating.

Being a cold and impartial mediator.

Xia Ge looks at him, wearing a mask and no expression on her face.

She thinks to herself, it's so cold.

Is it because she's too close to the ice bed?

"Is that so?" Her voice is clear and light.

She looks at Ye Ze, then around at the others. Their gazes are all different, but each one seems to strip her bare, like needles piercing her bones.

Xia Ge smiles. "I used to think the same, that you wouldn't do something like this."

The boy who used to be shy under the moonlight, now putting her on display for everyone to see.

"But it doesn't matter," Xia Ge continues to smile. "Since you think I owe you so much and can never repay you, then it's okay."

The Tianzhu Ling slowly crawls up her wrist, wrapping around it. It's no longer cold, but warm, as if giving her strength.

Ye Ze numbly says, "I just wanted to clear your name."

After all, it's a fact that a ground-level alchemist can refine a Wanhun Pill using evil spirits, overcoming all obstacles.
If Xia Ge was Xia Wuyin, then... at least, she wouldn't attract so much criticism.

Xia Ge laughed.

Innocent?

Why should she, Xia Ge, pick up the things she threw away with the help of others?

Those who believe will believe to the end, and those who don't believe, no matter how much you say, they won't believe a single word.

Is she still laughing secretly now? At least, Ye Ze still believes in her?

Ha.

But.

"I don't need it." Xia Ge's voice was cold, "And no one will believe it either."

Innocent... Either Ye Ze is a fool, or he's treating her like a fool.

Lingxi Peak has already expelled her from the sect, and [Zhi] has issued a mainland wanted order. Now, exposing her identity is to force her onto a dead end.

No turning back.

"I don't need anyone to believe."

Ye Ze looked at her and spoke slowly, "Whether anyone believes it or not, Xia Wuyin, Lingxi Peak is no longer suitable for you."
