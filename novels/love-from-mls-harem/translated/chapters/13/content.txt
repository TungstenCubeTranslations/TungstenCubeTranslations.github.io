The little girl in her arms was crying uncontrollably, and although Xia Ge wanted to comfort her, she didn't know what to say. To be honest, she was more concerned about the scallion pancake she had just thrown away.

So where did she throw it? It was wrapped tightly in oil paper, maybe she could wipe it off and still eat it...

System: "...Didn't you just throw it away? Why are you looking for it again?"

Xia Ge looked serious: "Because it's not just a scallion pancake."

System: "...?"

Xia Ge: "It's also two copper coins, you know, two!"

System: "..."

Sometimes it's hard to find words to describe someone else's lack of ambition.

"Scallion pancake?"

A familiar yet unfamiliar girl's voice sounded, followed by her collar being grabbed and lifted up, "You want to eat scallion pancakes?"

Xia Ge: "..."

For some reason, Xia Ge suddenly wanted to explain that scallion pancakes were for eating, not for carrying around...

She did explain, "No, I just lost my scallion pancake..."

"Can you put her down?"

She was still holding the little girl in one hand, and she was a little heavy!

Chu Yao raised an eyebrow, "Lost it?"

She had seen this young man's ghostly speed and watched as the scallion pancake he threw was stepped on by someone else.

Didn't the short guy throw the scallion pancake himself?

Chu Yao frowned.

And that speed just now...was it really the level of an outer disciple?

Xia Ge was about to explain further when she heard a familiar boy's voice.
"Young man... I just picked up this... is this your pancake?" 

Xia Ge didn't even open her eyes and immediately nodded, "Yes, yes, it's mine--"

Regardless of whether it was a gold or silver pancake, the pancake found on the ground was definitely hers!

Li Liu was holding the pancake that he had stepped on with his two feet, intending to apologize to this young disciple who was being lifted up by Lord Chu with one hand while closing his eyes, and tactfully suggesting whether he should compensate him with a new one. Who knew that before he could even speak, his hand suddenly became empty--

Li Liu: "Huh, no--"

How did you close your eyes so quickly...

But seeing this young disciple with green hair band holding a crying little girl in his left hand and tightly holding the unsightly pancake in his right hand, he decisively interrupted his words, "Thank you, Senior Brother, for helping me pick it up!! I am extremely grateful. May I ask for Senior Brother's name, so I can visit and express my gratitude for this pancake in the future!"

Li Liu glanced at the green hair band on the young disciple's head and was momentarily speechless. Younger brother, are we really from the same sect...

What is this pancake gratitude thing?

Li Liu: "...No, that pancake is--"

"Ah? Senior Brother, are you asking where to buy the pancake? You can see Uncle Xu's pancake shop as soon as you enter the village. His pancake is really delicious. You're welcome, Senior Brother. Go and try it out--"

Li Liu: "No, it's not--"

Chu Yao glanced over with her light brown eyes, coldly saying, "Speak up if you have something to say!"

Still a disciple of Jianfeng, stuttering and annoying to look at.

He choked on Li Liu's words in his throat and finally said helplessly, "Well, forget it..."

Xia Ge interrupted, "Senior Brother, do you have anything else to say?"

Under Chu Yao's icy gaze, Li Liu was sweating profusely and hesitated to speak, "...No, nothing."

-Young man, it's okay to close your eyes when you snatch the pancake, but you must open your eyes when you eat it.

Li Liu left with a worried heart.

System: [Why don't you let people finish their sentences?]

Xia Ge: [He must be thinking that I picked up the pancake from the ground and was disgusted by it. What if he says it out loud? I don't care about my face! ]
System: "..." Do you know it was picked up from the ground? Suffocating.

Li Liu left, the nearby villagers were afraid of the status of Chu Yao's disciple, and didn't dare to approach, only watching from afar and whispering.

"Indeed, only Lord Chu has left the Sword Peak..."

"Sigh."

"But if Lord Chu leaves Sword Peak..."

"It's still early..."

"Hey...you guys." Chu Yao grabbed Xia Ge's collar, glanced around with a frown and a fierce expression, "What are you looking at?! Don't you have anything to do?!"

The crowd scattered like birds and beasts.

The little girl cried tiredly, sobbing.

Xia Ge's arms were a little sore and helpless as he asked, "Can you put me down? Why are you carrying me?"

Chu Yao said, "You're too short...I have something to tell you."

She didn't like to bend down and talk to short people.

Xia Ge was shocked and scared, "You don't have to say it! I won't offer my body!!"

Chu Yao's forehead twitched - good, good, since meeting this guy, she has heard this awkward ancestral motto twice.

She didn't want to know the ancestral motto set by the stupid old ancestor of the Lingxi Peak!

"No, offer, your, body, for, marriage." Chu Yao mocked each word through gritted teeth, "Also, you're too short, not a match for me."

... This, this statement has a lot of information!

Xia Ge was shocked and scared, "I'm so beautiful, if I grow taller and match you, you won't just take me by force, will you?!"

Chu Yao relied on her good self-control to restrain her desire to throw this guy out in an instant.

She had seen people with thick skin, but never one with such an awkward and embarrassing personality!

The child in Xia Ge's arms obviously didn't understand their conversation full of "meaning," and was crying so hard that she couldn't catch her breath. Xia Ge was not only shocked, but also worried. The hero of Sword Peak was holding her so high, and she couldn't just put down the child in her arms...no, let her go.
"...Just because you're as tall as Sword Peak, I won't force myself on you." Chu Yao gritted her teeth. "This ancestral rule is useless to me-"

Summer Song caught on to the main point, looking distressed. "I won't ever be as tall as Sword Peak...but even if I were, you wouldn't force yourself on me? Am I really that good-looking, or are your eyes just broken?"

Chu Yao: "..."

Isn't it your brain that's broken?

"Wow-"

The little girl cried her heart out.

Chu Yao wisely gave up talking to an idiot, lifting her up with one hand and twirling the sword in the other, embedding it into the scabbard at her waist. She picked up the crying little girl from Summer Song's arms and placed her on the ground, suppressing the urge to beat up Summer Song. With a black face, she said, "Hey, stop crying."

"It's getting late, let's go home."

The little girl trembled, tears streaming down her eyes, sobbing, "Sister, are you a disciple of Sword Peak?"

Chu Yao was not very patient, but she couldn't harden her heart towards a crying child. "Mhm, I am."

Kids were really troublesome.

"Can I...can I become someone like you too?"

The little girl grabbed onto the blue and white hem of her pants, crying, "To become someone who can kill many, many bad puppets with just one sword..."

Chu Yao raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised. So this little girl...admires her?

She felt a little proud.

"It wasn't me who saved you, it was this." Chu Yao shook the idiot dwarf in her arms that refused to let go of the pastry.

"But I want to become someone like you, Sister!" The little girl suddenly shouted, her eyes red from crying but bright like stars. "I want to become someone who can kill bad guys!"

Summer Song was sure the hero wouldn't ask for her hand in marriage, so she yawned, grateful that she hadn't slept in two days and was being held up in the air. She had no interest in the conversation.

But this little girl's thoughts were a bit problematic.

Chu Yao narrowed her eyes, a wild smile appearing on her lips. "You little brat, what are you thinking? I'm the most powerful person on all of Sword Peak. If you want to become someone like me, you're far from it."

Summer Song was lifted off the ground, her feet not touching the floor, lazily listening without any interest.
The most powerful person in Sword Peak and the person who kicked fourteen pear wood desks to pieces, who is stronger...

Oh... come to think of it, she remembers that in the book, the Sword Peak was a fearless genius girl, invincible with her sword.

She was the myth of the sword that swept through the Lingxi Peak, and she was undoubtedly the most worthy person in Sword Peak.

Of course, myths are meant to be broken.

Sigh, but now, Ye Ze doesn't seem like the person who can break myths.

Chu Yao lifted her chin, revealing a sparkling tiger tooth, "But I allow you to admire me, and become the strongest person in the entire Lingxi Peak after I leave Sword Peak!"

The little girl stared at Chu Yao, and for a moment, the light in her eyes became even brighter.

The voice of the teenage hero was arrogant and confident, "But as long as I am in Sword Peak, no one can surpass me!"

Xia Ge knew without opening his eyes that the person who could say such things must have been born with brilliance.

But Xia Ge was very tired.

Xia Ge: Sigh, hardworking people are always so shiny and enviable.

System: Why are you saying such cold words?

Xia Ge: Why work hard when being shiny only makes you a target? Being a well-fed and well-drinked salted fish is much better.

System:... You'll just pick up trash all your life, loser.

Xia Ge shook his head.

So, this confident Sword Peak girl never got to say the words that Xia Ge wanted to say to the little girl.

What a pity.

She was truly the pride of the Sword Peak.

But, the little girl...

Becoming a strong killer and becoming a hero who can save others are completely different concepts.

However, some words are only useful when spoken by someone who was born to shine.
"People only listen to the words of the winner.

Unfortunately, Xia Ge is not a winner, nor is she a compass that can guide people. She is just a salted fish that can be intercepted halfway even when she wants to save someone.

And the words of a salted fish carry little weight.

The system tried to comfort her: I just checked the information, and when a salted fish is caught, its scales can also glow in the sunlight.

Xia Ge: Oh, it was probably dying at that time.

System: ...

The author has something to say:

System: When a salted fish starts to glow.

Xia Ge: It becomes an electric fish!

Hmm... about setting a CP

Today, I read the outline again, went through it from beginning to end, and made a simple summary. I also went through the CP lines of the three characters.

I found that only the senior sister will be throughout the whole story.

Because everyone seems to be uneasy about setting a CP, I revised the outline to make the senior sister the CP, but the plot lines will not change.
