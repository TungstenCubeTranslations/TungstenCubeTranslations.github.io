At the same time, the person holding Ye Ze let go and flashed to the girl's side.

In the instant that Ye Ze looked up, the sword in his hand was swung out!

Wen Qing traced a cold arc in the air, and the next moment, the sharp blade was caught between the girl's two pretty fingers.

Su Chan smiled faintly at the corner of her mouth, "Still so impulsive, it's not good."

Ye Ze gritted his teeth, his spirit overflowing, "Stop talking!!!"

Qin Yue stood beside Su Chan, looking at Ye Ze with emotionless black eyes.

The resentment in her heart almost broke everything. Ye Ze held Wen Qing's sword tightly and almost exhausted all his strength, but it was nothing under the slender girl's fingers.

The girl's narrow eyes reflected the morning light, showing pity in her eyes. Her voice was shallow, "So pitiful."

"Living in hatred like this, there's nothing."

"Really, too pitiful."

"Shut up!!" Ye Ze was furious. "What do you know?!!"

Su Chan sighed lightly, flicked her fingers, and the next moment, Wen Qing's sword in Ye Ze's hand flew out, drawing a cold arc in the air. Finally, the hilt fell lightly into the girl's hand, and the blade lay across the boy's neck--

Everything happened in an instant.

"I don't need to understand." Su Chan smiled slightly, looking at him with calm pupils. "People have various emotions. Sometimes, you don't need to understand too much."

"Just knowing what they want is enough."

Ye Ze could feel the cold temperature of Wen Qing on his neck. The momentum was completely different from when it was in his hand.

He had also seen the feeling of Wen Qing in Gu Peijiu's hand.

It was also different.

He couldn't describe it, but he felt that when Wen Qing was in Gu Peijiu's hand, it seemed to blend with her, natural and smooth, following her heart, pointing and breaking everything, but with a shallow melancholy.

However, when Wen Qing was in this person's hand--
However, as if finding its true master, Wenqing exuded a strong aura of hostility and terrifying pressure.

It seemed that at any moment, it could cause chaos and destroy everything.

"I know what you want," Su Chan said suddenly. Even under the pressure of Su Chan's imposing presence, Ye Ze remained unfazed. He stared at Qin Yue, his eyes turning red. "I want her dead!"

"Little one, it's easy to want someone dead," Su Chan said, his eyes showing pity. "But just like a sword that obeys whoever wields it, if you have nothing, you won't even know where to go, let alone who to attack. It's really... pitiful."

"I can fulfill your wish," Su Chan continued. "But you must know a little bit of truth."

"Truth?" Ye Ze sneered, pointing at Qin Yue. "What, so it wasn't her who killed over two hundred people in my Ye family?!"

Ye Ze had meant to say Xia Wuyin, but the name rolled around on his tongue before he swallowed it.

The name was like a stone, weighing heavily on his heart, making it hard to speak.

Su Chan laughed lightly. "It was her. But..."

Su Chan threw Wenqing away and let the cold sword fall to the ground with a clang.

The pressure suddenly disappeared.

"She's just a sword," Su Chan said. 

Ye Ze's pupils shrank slightly.

Su Chan smiled at him. "What you need to know is who is the one holding the sword."

Ye Ze sneered. "Are you telling me she's innocent? Are you joking?"

Su Chan said, "No one is innocent."

"I just think you should know something..."

"As for what you do with this knowledge, it's up to you... Of course, if you don't want to know, I won't tell you."
"After all, I, Su Chan, never make a losing deal." Su Chan chuckled lightly. "Knowing the truth comes with a price, but I think... you'll be willing to pay it."

"After all... even if we killed her now," Su Chan glanced at Qin Yue who remained silent, her eyelashes trembling slightly, a faint smile on his lips. "It wouldn't mean anything, right?"

"..."

Ye Ze looked at the Wenqing Sword on the ground, trying to calm himself down.

He thought of Xia Wuyin, the wanderer.

He knew... she was also someone who knew nothing.

After a long time.

"...What's the price?"

Su Chan's lips curved slightly.

"I like talking to smart people."

After leaving the Sword Peak, Xia Ge went to Su Xi.

The peach blossoms in Su Xi were indeed in bloom.

The petals were thin and loose, with only two or three petals in each flower.

She spoke in a faint voice, "You've been following me for so long and have heard so much. There's no point in hiding anymore, come out."

Previously on Sword Peak, the person she called out to wasn't Li Liu, but another person who had been following her for a long time.

However, that person didn't come out, and instead, Li Liu, an unexpected person, came out.

There were faint rustling sounds in the mountains and forests, and after a while, a young man fell from a tree.

Xia Ge turned around and furrowed her eyebrows slightly. "Who are you?"

The young man was wearing Sword Peak's clothes, with a silver bell hanging from his waist and a large sword on his back. Strangely, no matter how he moved, the silver bell remained silent.

Xia Ge felt like she had seen him before, but she rarely went to Sword Peak in the past three years, so even if he looked familiar, she couldn't remember his name.
The young man had sharp edges and corners, with his eyes slightly upturned, giving off an arrogant air. But when he looked at her, his eyes softened and he seemed unsure where to look. He glanced at Xia Ge before quickly looking away, focusing on the two peach trees behind the young girl. "I'm Chang Nian," he said.

So this is her little brother, Xia Ge thought. He had been at Lingxi Peak all along, but she had no idea.

"You've been following me these past few days?" Xia Ge furrowed her brow. "What for?"

Chang Nian replied, "It's nothing."

Should he tell her?

Xia Ge said, "If it's nothing, then go back. Don't follow me anymore."

She didn't want to see anyone from Jianfeng right now.

As she turned to leave, Chang Nian panicked and blurted out, "Sister!"

Xia Ge stopped in her tracks, surprised. "What?"

Chang Nian immediately shut his mouth, his face turning red. He didn't say anything else.

Chang Nian... was he from the Chang family?

Xia Ge stared at him, slowly understanding. "You're... from the Chang family?"

Chang Nian admitted it straightforwardly, his gaze fixed on her. "Yes... you're my half-sister."

She was Qin Yue's daughter, Qin Shuang.

A few years ago, Qin Yue had a child with the head of the Chang family, Hua Qianyue. They had Qin Shuang, and then Hua Qianyue had used the opportunity to destroy the Ye family and obtain the Sky Illumination Pearl, pinning the blame on Qin Yue.

Now, Xia Ge realized she had half Chang family blood.

...But she wouldn't dwell on past grudges for now.
The man's act of seeking her out to confirm their relationship after hearing what Li Liu had said earlier could be considered understandable. However, he had been following her secretly since their time at the Evil Spirit Mountain. Did he already know that he was her brother back then? How did he find out?

Xia Ge paused for a moment and asked, "You knew about it a long time ago?"

Chang Nian didn't hide anything from her and took off the bell hanging from his waist. "This is the Wenchuan Bell you recognized when you were a child. It will ring as long as your state of mind improves."

"This is a pair, and the other one called the Demon-Slaying Bell is with your mother. It will also ring if your state of mind improves."

"I didn't know you were Xia Wu..." Chang Nian paused and carefully took care of her emotions. "When the bell rang at the Evil Spirit Mountain, you were the only one who had just been promoted. I wasn't sure if it was you... but it was right to follow you anyway."

He whispered, "I've always wanted to see you. When you were very young, I saw you... I even held you."

And then, they never saw each other again.

"I see..." Xia Ge laughed at herself. "No wonder, no wonder..."

No wonder Li Liu was so sure that she was the one.

With this pair of bells, there was really no escaping them even if they were at the ends of the earth.

After a pause, Xia Ge asked, "Are you here to confirm our relationship?"

Chang Nian hesitated to speak. "I..."

"It's okay to confirm our relationship."

"But have you asked your father and brothers?" Xia Ge smiled softly and spoke gently. "After all, who I am is unclear to you, but they know very well."

"...It has nothing to do with my father and brothers!" Chang Nian clenched his fists. "You are my younger sister!"

Xia Ge's gaze turned slightly cold. "You are really too naive."

Chang Nian fell silent.

In the eyes of the Chang family, she and Qin Yue were both abandoned children.

Although Xia Ge didn't care about this, the fact that the Chang family, who had caused her so much harm, was calling her their little sister here was really hard to express in words.
Innocent and naive.

Really good.

Chang Nian often said, "I don't know what my father and brothers are thinking...but..."

He clenched his fist and lowered his voice, "I think they shouldn't treat you like this..."

Is he a pampered young master who speaks without thinking?

Xia Ge thought, it seems like a long time ago when Ye Ze was still very young, he also spoke so innocently and naively.

Senior Sister never had... Senior Sister always spoke coldly, but when it came to her, she was always gentle and patient. She had seen Senior Sister's gentle, cold, and ruthless sides...except for her childish side.

What was Senior Sister like when she was young?

Xia Ge was a little lost in thought.

Her gloomy mood seemed to have improved a lot all of a sudden.

She even had a little patience for Chang Nian, and she said patiently, "I don't know how they treat me, but I think they wouldn't want you to follow me forever."

"..."

"Go back, I won't acknowledge this marriage, and I don't want to. Also, I will never have the surname Chang, I am Xia Ge, remember that."

The girl turned around and walked away, her figure gradually disappearing into the distance.

Chang Nian held the bell and stood in place, looking at that figure for a long time.

After a while, he came back to his senses.

Yi Mei...Zhen Hun Wu Shuang? Yes, it's Zhen Hun Wu Shuang...and there was a legend before that Xia Xiao Zhang Ling only had a garment called Xiang Si.

Wait...

When Ah Mei was very young...father seemed to have given her a garment, why isn't it here now?

What was that garment called again?

Chang Nian frowned tightly.
"Call...disaster...?"

"I can't remember."

Due to Gu Peiju not waking up for a long time, the head of Lingxi Peak announced that she would be moved to the Lingxi Peak's Heart Nurturing Palace for quiet recuperation after he came out of seclusion.

And...the traitor Xia Wuyin was expelled from the sect.

When this news came out, except for Bixi feeling unhappy, there was no one else who opposed it.

The Heart Nurturing Palace was a large hall below the Lingxi Peak's Council Hall, with a concentration formation that gathered spiritual energy, making it a good place for practicing and recuperating in seclusion.

Of course, no idle people were allowed in.

Even if Xia Ge had the identity of a ground-level pill master, she would inevitably encounter some difficulties if she wanted to enter openly.

The night was quiet, and Xia Ge easily broke through the defense of the Sword Peak Sect outside and squatted on the roof of the Heart Nurturing Palace.

But she didn't go in.

The words Li Liu said a few days ago were like poison needles stuck in Xia Ge's heart, causing her vague pain.

She went back to look in the mirror specifically, and sure enough, she found the small butterfly birthmark on her shoulder.

The birthmark was very small.

But for Xia Ge, it was like a heavy blow to the head.

She felt upset and confused.

She didn't ask the system why, but just felt that the things in this world were so complicated and confusing, making people speechless.

The system poked her cautiously, "Well, the choice of body is random, and the most suitable body for your soul is Qin Shuang..."

The girl didn't reply. She sat quietly on the roof, her Town Soul Robe fluttering, the night sky faintly lit by the moon, but there was no starlight.

For a while, she thought about many things, some of them from modern times, bits and pieces. She hadn't had a car accident yet, and her wild youth was carefree, not knowing the heights of heaven and earth, and didn't know what worry was. At most, she felt that her younger brother was hard to manage, but there was nothing else to worry about.

She wouldn't be lonely, either.
Later on...

Those memories, indeed, have become somewhat distant.

Distant as if they never happened.

A streak quickly crossed the pitch-black night sky.

Xia Ge lifted her gaze, lost in thought.

The only star had fallen.

In her memories, there seemed to be such a scene.

The moon above was chilly, but the starlight was bright.

The girl in white lowered her body, embracing Xia Ge's neck. Her soft black hair spread out, and when she spoke, her familiar voice was so gentle that it made it hard to breathe.

"I will always be behind you."

"I will never leave you."

The moonlight was cold at that time, but the starlight was bright.

Xia Ge was momentarily dizzy.

The author has something to say: The next chapter might be a bit angsty. Why do I always make it angsty? I'm so anxious. Please scold me. (Hides under a pot)

Actually, I think Su Chan is a very complex character. When she's bad, she's really bad - "You are my believer. If you don't believe in me and love someone else, you're betraying me. If you betray the divine, you will pay the price. I will make you feel trapped, make you suffer, and let you know what it's like to be abandoned by everyone."

But... she also loves Xia Xia very much, and while she's being bad, she also feels sorry for her.

It's just that her way of expressing love is a bit different and very subtle.

You can vaguely see it in this chapter, but I don't know how to explain it. Following the outline, it should become clearer, but if I stray from it, then... a good pigeon never strays. (laughs)
