"Hey, this is not scientific."

Xia Ge flipped through the books, "Why can't I find any clues?"

She had searched through all the books about the old ancestor, except for a few wild histories, almost all the other clues were nowhere to be found.

System: "Keep looking."

"Why is it so difficult?"

The wild history book in her hand had a hot gold outer cover, looking very impressive, but it was full of irrelevant trivial matters about the Lingxi Peak. Xia Ge had originally wanted to find some clues about the Lingxi ancestor from here, but this book was all show and no substance, and naturally she gained nothing.

When she put the book back, Xia Ge vaguely felt that something was wrong.

There seemed to be something in the corner of the cover, wrapped in the cover, it felt a bit bulging when touched. Xia Ge took out the book again and fumbled around, "There seems to be something here...?"

System: "What's wrong?"

Xia Ge didn't answer, she just said, "Let me take a look..."

She carefully opened the cover and found a small square block the size of a fingernail, neatly folded between the hard paper cover and the soft wrapper.

System: "...What is this?"

"I don't know...I'll take a look first."

Xia Ge held the block and deftly wrapped the book and put it back in its original place. Just as she was about to look at it, her shoulder was suddenly tapped, and someone quietly called her name, "Xia Wuyin!"

Xia Ge was about to open the block, but this sudden tap startled her. The small block in her hand jumped and was suddenly grabbed back into her palm. She turned around and saw Mao Qing's curious face. "What are you looking at? So absorbed?"

Xia Ge felt her heart jump out of her chest, "When did you come?"

"Why can't I come...you've been studying in the library all these days, I'm bored, so I came to find you." Mao Qing asked, "What are you holding? Why are you so scared?"

Xia Ge pretended to be calm, "Love letters."

Mao Qing looked like she had seen a ghost, "What?"

"Someone gave you a love letter?"
Xia Ge: "...There's no way around it, I'm just that outstanding."

Mao Qing: "..."

System: "..."

Mao Qing's mouth twitched. "Alright, with your attitude like that, did you come to the library just to tear up love letters?"

"Of course... not," Xia Ge awkwardly changed the subject of the embarrassing love letter. "What brings you here to find me?"

"Can't I come find you for no reason?" Mao Qing asked.

Xia Ge looked nervous and shook her head repeatedly. "Are you also here to give me a love letter, Mao Qing? Let's not do that, we can still be friends..."

System: "..."

Mao Qing was speechless. "Alright, enough with the act, it's really annoying. I did come to find you for a reason."

"Huo Bai is leaving," she said.

Xia Ge's heart skipped a beat. "What did you say?"

"When I was leaving, I heard him telling the master that there was something going on at home and he needed to go back as soon as possible," Mao Qing explained. "I just wanted to let you know since you seemed to care about him before."

"Oh... I see. What does that have to do with me?" Xia Ge asked.

Mao Qing replied, "I'm just giving you a heads up. By the way, whose love letter was it?"

Xia Ge's mind was elsewhere. "Oh... it was Huo Bai's."

Mao Qing was shocked. "What?"

System: "...What?"

Xia Ge flashed a bright smile. "Just kidding."

Mao Qing told her to "get lost" and left. She didn't really like history, nor did she really want to deliver love letters for Xia Ge.

Xia Ge didn't like history either, but now she had to reluctantly like it for the sake of clues.
"This is really troublesome.

After Mao Qing left, Xia Ge slowly opened the small note.

The paper was very fragile and had yellowed, as if it had passed through a long time. Xia Ge carefully opened it, and dust flew in the warm sunlight shining through the paper window into the book room. The small characters on the paper were graceful and delicate, like a person whispering softly. It had passed through a hundred years of time and fell into the hands of someone with fate.

"Millions of corpses, wailing evil spirits, suppressed in Wuyi Mountain, offering peace for over fifty years, unable to atone for their sins. - Anonymous"

"...Anonymous?"

Xia Ge frowned as she looked at the small characters, her heart beating slightly. She seemed to have realized something, holding the note and quickly flipping through the bookshelf.

"Handwritten, handwritten..." Xia Ge flipped through the books quickly. She had basically flipped through this section of books before, so it didn't take long for her to find what she was looking for -

"Lingxi Ancestral Instructions, Old Ancestor's Handwriting, Rubbing Version"

Xia Ge opened the book and compared the characters on the note with those in the book. After a while, she closed the book and breathed a sigh of relief.

"...This is it."

The system saw the rubbing version of the handwritten book she was flipping through and asked, "Is this note from Lingxi Old Ancestor?"

Xia Ge looked at the note and thought for a moment, "Maybe. The content matches the scene on the ceiling of the old ancestor's tomb..."

The ceiling of the old ancestor's tomb had a weeping woman playing a flute, a mountain full of evil spirits, and the clothes that suppressed the evil spirits.

"But why did she write this and hide it here?" the system asked.

"...How would I know," Xia Ge looked at the content on the note and speculated, "Maybe...at that time, no one could talk about this kind of thing."

So she could only write it on a piece of paper, silently seal it in a book, and bury it in the dust of history.

As evidence that this incident had happened.

The system asked, "Hmm? What do you mean?"

Xia Ge said, "Who knows, I'm just guessing."

"But if she really did something like what was written on the note...why is there no trace of it?" Xia Ge was puzzled, "If there were really millions of evil spirits and such a big incident happened, it would have been recorded in history books by anyone."
Translation:

However, there was no trace of this matter.

What has been passed down through the ages is the infinite glory of her generation's ancestor, Lingxi.

Only in her silent tomb chamber, were there a few words of regret about this mistake.

The system guessed, "Could it be that she was afraid of future criticism, so she hid everything from the world, but felt guilty and wrote her regret in the tomb chamber?"

Xia Ge said, "Ah? That's so hypocritical."

The system said, "..."

Xia Ge said, "If you did it, you did it. Isn't this lying?"

The system said, "Shut up." You're the least qualified to say that.

Xia Ge said, "But I think it's not interesting. Even if she's famous, I don't know what good things she has done. She's just Lingxi's ancestor, and I only know that she likes to eat osmanthus cake. Isn't this unreasonable?"

The system said, "Lingxi Peak was opened by her. That alone makes her better than you."

Xia Ge took out the "Official History" and said firmly, "There are many people better than me. How come I don't know if the ancestor of Qianhun Sect eats osmanthus cake or visits the kiln?"

The system said, "..."

This conversation couldn't continue.

The system changed the subject, "...Huo Bai wants to withdraw."

"He certainly wants to withdraw." Xia Ge no longer thought about Lingxi's ancestor. She put the "Official History" on the bookshelf lazily and said, "The assassination mission failed, so why would he stay? It's not like me who wants to retire in Danfeng."

The system said, "...So are you going to let Huo Bai withdraw? Aren't you going to do something? Like 'accidentally' exposing him?"

Xia Ge rubbed her chin and said, "I'm just afraid of pushing too hard. If the fish dies and the net breaks, and my identity as a puppeteer is exposed, it would be a big problem."

Xia Ge put the small note away and shook her head, "I can't afford to gamble."

The system said, "Ah? So you're just going to ignore it?"

Xia Ge left the library and said, "Can I handle it? Let's talk about it later."

The system said, "So what are you going to do now?"
Xia Ge: "Guess."

The sun was shining, the flowers were blooming, and the frangipani outside the study was particularly radiant.

In front of the window, a girl dressed in red and white maple clothes quietly looked at the scroll, her hand holding a vermilion pen, which made her white hands look like jade.

Xia Ge casually picked a branch of pink frangipani and put it behind her back. She stood at the window with a smile, and said, "Good afternoon, senior sister."

Gu Peiju's hand holding the pen paused for a moment, but she didn't look up. She put the completed scroll aside and said, "Hmm, hello."

The faint scent of sandalwood mixed with the fragrance of frangipani filled the air, making it very pleasant.

"Senior sister, senior sister, don't look down, look up at me." Xia Ge said with a smile, "Stop grading papers."

Gu Peiju ignored her and said lightly, "Stop fooling around, go play somewhere else."

Xia Ge exclaimed and ran into the study. As she pushed open the door, the bright sunlight poured in. She slipped to Gu Peiju's side and stretched out the frangipani in her hand, saying, "Senior sister, look at the flowers!"

The frangipani branch, which had been brutally cut, swayed with the girl's movements, and the pink petals fell gently with the breeze. Some of them fell on the recently graded scroll, and one even fell on the word "permit" that she had just written, staining the pink petal with red ink, like a dream that couldn't be awakened.

Gu Peiju glanced at the ink-stained petal, then turned to look at Xia Ge.

The flowers in Xia Ge's hand had fallen off miserably, leaving only a defeated green branch. Many petals had fallen on her collar, and she looked at the branch in her hand awkwardly before hiding it behind her back. "It's ruined," she said.

Then she exclaimed happily, "Senior sister, you looked at me!"

Gu Peiju waved her hand casually, and a gentle breeze blew away the fallen petals on the girl's collar. She asked, "What brings you here?"

Xia Ge blinked. "To pay my respects!"

Gu Peiju didn't look at her and said, "Tell me the truth."

"I didn't lie, I really came to pay my respects," Xia Ge shook the branch in her hand and looked around. "Well, of course, I also have a question to ask."

Gu Peiju said, "Before that, I have something to ask you."

Xia Ge was puzzled. "Huh?"

Gu Peiju casually flipped through the scroll and said, "Have you heard of the Evil Ghost Tide?"

It was as if something was pointing directly at her heart, squeezing it tightly, and then grasping the most deadly point.
Xia Ge's pupils shrank slightly, and her whole body trembled as if she had been shocked by electricity. A jumble of thoughts flashed through her mind, then turned into a blank slate.

The green branch in her hand fell lightly and slipped from her grasp, landing silently among the broken petals on the ground.

Xia Ge heard her own voice, which sounded stiff: "You said...what...evil spirit...tide?"

--Clearly, she had never heard of this term before.

--But why did she feel a sense of familiarity and fear, as if her heart was being squeezed?
