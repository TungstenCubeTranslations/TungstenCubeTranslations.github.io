"Miss, this child..."

Bixi, who had always taken care of Gu Peijiu's daily life, looked at the hurried young lady carrying a black-clad youth with some surprise. When she came to her senses, she quickly went up and said, "Miss, let me hold him. What happened to you?"

As soon as she approached, the strong smell of rust spread out. Even though the young lady was wrapped tightly, Bixi could still see the thick blood stains on her white clothes, like flowers blooming on the other side of the Yellow Springs, dazzling and somewhat terrifying.

The girl in the red and white maple dress stepped back, her eyebrows and eyes cold, her voice faint, "Go get some hot water."

Bixi panicked, "Yes."

Was it the blood of the child in her arms? What happened to cause such injuries?

Bixi burned water in the kitchen, lost in thought. Her young lady had always been clean, but this time...

The big pot of water was boiling with steam, and Bixi, who had come back to her senses, filtered the boiling water into a wooden basin, put a towel on it, and hurriedly walked towards Gu Peijiu's room with the basin.

She lifted the beaded curtain, and Bixi instinctively tiptoed in and called out softly, "Miss?"

But she saw her young lady sitting on the edge of the bed, with the delicate young man lying on the soft bed, his face pale, his eyebrows furrowed, his forehead covered in cold sweat. He tightly pursed his slightly cracked lips, his chest heaving up and down, looking very painful and uneasy.

"It hurts..."

Gu Peijiu gently stroked his forehead with her hand, nodded in response to his words, and Bixi put the basin aside and said nervously, "Miss, can I take care of him?"

Gu Peijiu didn't say anything, just lowered her gaze slightly. Bixi followed her gaze and saw that the young man's hand was tightly holding the left sleeve of her clothes, his fingertips turning blue.

It was like grasping the only straw for survival.

Bixi was speechless.

"I'll take care of him." Gu Peijiu said, paused, "You wring out the towel and go get those scrolls."

"Yes." Bixi replied, handing the damp towel to Gu Peijiu and turning to get the scrolls. Gu Peijiu left one hand free to let him hold her sleeve, while the other hand neatly folded the damp towel and gently applied it to the young man's forehead.

"It hurts, it hurts..."

The young man's voice was hoarse, but he held her sleeve even tighter.

All he knew was that it hurt.
Gu Peijiu hesitated for a moment, unsure of her feelings. In the end, she simply dipped her finger in the hot water and gently applied it to the cracked lips of the young man, gradually moisturizing them.

She had given him a hemostatic pill earlier, so the wound would not bleed for the time being, but the pain caused by the torn wound was unavoidable.

Thinking of the young man who couldn't stop the movement of the Dan Jue earlier and kept hitting the wound against the edge of the table, Gu Peijiu's heart was complicated.

"Miss, the dossier is here." The emerald holding the dossier carefully said, "Should I put it on the table?"

"Um." Gu Peijiu nodded and then stood up to pick up the dossier. When she felt that the person beside her was about to leave, the young man suddenly seemed to be stimulated, "Don't, don't go--"

Gu Peijiu paused and stopped her movement, saying, "Go and call the doctor from the foot of the mountain to come and check the injury."

"Yes."

Emerald left.

"Don't go." The young man's voice was faintly crying and weak, "It hurts."

Gu Peijiu looked at her sleeve held tightly by him, her gaze slowly rising, and finally stopped on the pale face of the young man who kept shouting in pain even when he was unconscious.

After a while.

"Well, I won't go."

Gu Peijiu sat down and gently held the hand he was holding onto her sleeve. The young man's hand had distinct bones and was so thin that it made people feel sorry for him.

After she said she wouldn't leave, the young man held her hand, and although his brow was furrowed due to pain, his expression was slightly more stable.

Gu Peijiu felt a slight jump in her heart and heard the young man whisper softly.

"Doudou, don't let me go."

= =

Xia Ge felt like she was about to die from the pain.

Perhaps the time for the anesthesia given by Su Chan had passed, and the poison on the Wusheng Dagger would cause a very intense pain. The wound area now felt like it had been sprinkled with salt, causing a severe burning pain.

It hurt so much that she wanted to wake up, but because of the backlash of the spiritual energy earlier, her head was still buzzing. It was like being half-hung in the abyss, half of it was the call of reality's pain, and the other half was the exhaustion of her spirit dragging her into the abyss of darkness to sleep forever.

Everything seemed to be surreal and painful.
Everything in her mind began to become chaotic, some past memories that she had deliberately blurred began to slowly surface.

"What are you daydreaming about, Shuangshuang? Let's go find something to eat."

"Ah, Shuangshuang, what should we eat today?"

That blurry figure slowly became clear again.

She remembered.

She thought she was about to forget.

- Shuangshuang was the name of this body when she first crossed over to this world.

Shuangshuang was a little beggar, probably six or seven years old, with a good friend named Dou Dou who was older than her by a few years, but Dou Dou didn't know exactly how old she was.

The two of them begged together in a village called Nanming, living a life of worrying about their next meal.

Nanming was a very poor village, and when Xiage crossed over, there was a famine going on. Although this body had naturally great strength, at only six or seven years old, strength was useless and she couldn't do much.

No money, no food, no beauty, nothing at all, just two homeless children begging for survival. Oh, no, if there was something, it was that she had a friend named Dou Dou.

At that time, the stars were shining in the sky, and the two girls who had just finished chewing on tree leaves climbed up the dry crooked-neck tree, trying to cool off in the wind and discuss their future.

Dou Dou, who had just finished chewing on wutong leaves, asked, "What do you want to do when you grow up, Shuangshuang?"

After two months of suffering from hunger and cold, Xiage wrapped herself in her tattered clothes, with a worried look on her face, and envisioned her future, "Hmm... probably becoming rich, if I could eat every day, that would be great, even though it's a bit difficult now, dreams are always necessary... Or becoming really powerful, like punching the old people's home in the south and kicking the kindergarten in the north."

That way, she could go rob people.

Dou Dou was confused, "Shuangshuang, why are you talking about things I don't understand again?"

Xiage paused, looked at her thin arms and legs, and finally rationalized throwing away the terrible idea of robbing the rich to help the poor, and decided to continue being a friendly socialist successor, and gently explained her dream to Dou Dou, "It's just eating delicious food every day, and licking the lids of yogurt and throwing them away."

Dou Dou asked, "What's a yogurt lid?"

Xiage dismissed it, "It's something delicious."
Although she didn't understand, Dou Dou still sincerely wished her friend: "Shuang Shuang, there will definitely be that day."

-There won't be that day, because there is no Wei X yogurt here, nor yogurt lids.

Xia Ge, who received the blessing, was not very happy. Although two months ago, she didn't lick and throw away one yogurt lid after another, she could definitely do it if she wanted to throw away a hundred.

But just about three minutes ago, Xia Ge, who used to be able to throw a hundred yogurt lids, tasted the flavor of phoenix tree leaves.

That taste is really...indescribable.

Xia Ge covered her mouth, in order to forget that taste, and to care about her little friend's inner life, and to enrich her own dull begging life, Xia Ge asked in a depressed tone: "What does Dou Dou want to do in the future?"

Ah, it seems that two elementary school students are exploring their dreams under the warm sun of socialism.

Xia Ge covered her mouth full of leaf flavor and looked at her small arm.

Well, in fact, she seems to be in kindergarten now.

Dou Dou looked up at the stars for a while, and whispered: "In the future...I hope...to be forever free."

Xia Ge: "???"

How could Dou Dou have such a high level of life and life understanding in such a starving situation?

Isn't it too free now?

Free to the point that her taste buds are beginning to sink with phoenix tree leaves.

Xia Ge just wanted to tactfully refute her little friend who had just eaten phoenix tree leaves with her, but she heard Dou Dou's voice faintly ringing, "Shuang Shuang, I think we're doing fine like this. Although we can't eat, we're very free. I didn't understand the good of freedom before, but look at those slaves who were sold, and the girls who were taken away to be prostitutes. Although they can eat every day, I don't envy them at all."

Xia Ge paused and didn't say anything.

Well...since the other party thinks this way, there must be some reason.

Although a dream of a free little beggar wanting to be more free is full of flaws...

"...Don't you want to become stronger?" Xia Ge decided to take a roundabout way and approach the topic from the side. "Dou Dou, we're actually not free at all like this."

Dou Dou looked at her, seeming to not understand what she meant.
"There are more things that imprison people than just chains and rules. There's also hunger and poverty," Xia Ge said. "To be honest, as long as people are alive, they're never truly free..."

Dou Dou tilted her head, looking a bit confused.

"Oh, maybe you'll understand if I give an example," Xia Ge said.

"What are we going to eat tomorrow?" Dou Dou's face scrunched up.

"You see, we can't even decide what to eat tomorrow. How can that be called freedom?" Xia Ge explained.

The example was quite appropriate. Tomorrow's meal was indeed a very real and not very free problem they would soon face.

Dou Dou hugged her legs, looking up at the bright stars in the night sky. Perhaps the reality of Xia Ge's proposition was too difficult, as she decided to ignore the inedible example. "Shuang Shuang just said... she wants to become very powerful?"

Xia Ge was still worrying about tomorrow's breakfast, having lost interest in looking towards the future. Though not very heartfelt, she still replied, "Mm, very powerful... so powerful that everyone kneels down and calls me daddy."

Seeing Dou Dou's bewildered expression, it was clear she didn't understand why Xia Ge liked to be called daddy.

... Elementary school students were so troublesome. Xia Ge reluctantly explained, "Ah... I mean, I want to become someone that many powerful people admire... you know, the kind that even the emperor would bow to... become someone who sparkles and shines."

After speaking, Xia Ge sighed.

It was already dark, and here she was, daydreaming with elementary school students.

"A person who sparkles and shines?" Dou Dou was puzzled. "Are there people who actually shine?"

Xia Ge replied, "..." No, wait, actually this is a metaphor...

But Dou Dou didn't know what Xia Ge was thinking, and her brow furrowed as she happily asked, "After Shuang Shuang becomes powerful, will she shine too? Like... those stars up there?"

Xia Ge replied, "..." Well, it seems like that's not wrong, but it's not exactly what she meant by shining.
Xia Ge: "No, it's... becoming a dazzling person..."

Dou Dou hasn't been to many places and doesn't understand many things. Xia Ge thinks Dou Dou is a bit naive, but cute like a primary school student.

Cute in a slightly foolish way.

Xia Ge thought for a moment and decided to explain it to Dou Dou in a way she would understand. "It means having the ability, being very capable, and being liked by many, many people because of your abilities... even in a crowd, you can be noticed by others. That kind of person is a 'dazzling' person."

"Actually, you're right about the stars," Xia Ge looked up at the sky, feeling melancholy. "They're all existences that people look up to."

This time, Dou Dou understood and laughed. But then she thought about it and became distressed again. "But if you're that capable, you have to take care of many, many people, right? Like the village chief, he's so capable, but he has to take care of so many people in the village. He's always worried and his hair is falling out. If Shuang Shuang is like that, she'll definitely be very tired. I don't want Shuang Shuang to lose her hair, it'll be so ugly."

Xia Ge thought of the "old" village chief in Nanning Village who was bald in his twenties and paused, agreeing deeply, "You're right. It's better to be slightly less capable. As long as we can eat enough, it's fine."

"Mm-hmm," Dou Dou tilted her head and looked at Xia Ge for a while.

"But, Shuang Shuang, you said you're not capable, why do I feel like you're also shining?"

Xia Ge instinctively looked at herself, "..."

Dou Dou: "I think you're also a dazzling person."

Seeing Dou Dou's serious expression, Xia Ge couldn't help but smile, but her heart was warmed.

She's really pathetic, having lived for more than twenty years, and in the end, she was comforted by a child.

"Since I shine in your eyes, I will definitely take good care of you," Xia Ge decided to act a little more tenderly and imitated Dou Dou's way of speaking, "I can't become a star that takes care of many people, but I can take care of Dou Dou as Shuang Shuang!"

Dou Dou obediently asked, "Then Shuang Shuang, can you give an example? What are we going to eat tomorrow?"

Xia Ge: "..." This example isn't appetizing, let's put it down.

They're both starving, and she's still boasting about being able to take care of Dou Dou. She's really... where did she get her confidence from?

"Ah! I remember!" Xia Ge clapped her hands and her eyes lit up. "I remember there's a swamp over there in the village... shall we go take a look?"
The light in Dou Dou's eyes dimmed immediately, and she shook her head like a drum. She grabbed her sleeve and said, "Don't go, many people have disappeared there... The villagers say that there are evil spirits there that eat people."

Xia Ge said confidently, "That's all lies! I'm very strong and have great strength. Trust me, I can protect you!"

Dou Dou said softly, "I'm afraid of ghosts."

Xia Ge smiled and said, "It's okay, don't be afraid. I can protect you."

Dou Dou looked into her eyes and was momentarily lost. Perhaps it was because she was too hungry, or perhaps it was because she thought Xia Ge's eyes were beautiful. Finally, Dou Dou bit her lip and reluctantly said, "Okay then."

She whispered, "I believe in you, Xia Ge."

Xia Ge nodded and boasted, "Believe me, you won't go wrong. I'm even stronger than Brother Chun!"

Dou Dou looked confused and asked, "Who is Brother Chun?"

Xia Ge replied, "Well, Brother Chun is very powerful... he's a shining person."

Dou Dou immediately understood and obediently said, "Oh, okay. Xia Ge is even stronger than Brother Chun!"

Xia Ge thought to herself that she was so confident because she knew that the swamp on the outskirts of the village was said to have man-eating evil spirits. Perhaps someone had accidentally fallen into the swamp and died there. And she wanted to find something to eat on the outskirts.

As long as they stayed on the outskirts, it would be fine.

Xia Ge led Dou Dou closer to the outskirts. The swamp was dark, with clumps of reeds. Xia Ge squatted down and dug for a long time, getting her hands muddy. The stars and moon were bright, and Dou Dou watched curiously as Xia Ge worked. After a while, Xia Ge exclaimed, "Haha, I found some!" She excitedly showed Dou Dou the water chestnuts she had dug up from the ground, as if they were treasures. "I don't have to eat magnolia leaves anymore! Ah... ah-choo!" 

The reeds had many bugs, and Xia Ge was itching all over, sneezing several times in a row.

It was pitch black all around, and Dou Dou was anxious. She couldn't help but laugh when she saw Xia Ge sneeze. After laughing, she couldn't resist her curiosity and asked, "What is that in your hand?"

Xia Ge smiled and replied, "Water chestnuts! They're for eating!"

"Wait a minute, let me find some more." Xia Ge squatted down again and dug around in the reeds for a while. In the end, she only found five or six water chestnuts. She had wanted to find more, but after searching for a long time, she couldn't find any more. In the end, they had to reluctantly return to the village amidst the howling of wild dogs.

"Let's go back quickly. The wild dogs are howling. It wouldn't be good if we encounter an evil spirit tide," Dou Dou said.
"What is the Evil Ghost Tide?" Xia Ge wiped the water chestnut clean with her sleeve and handed one to Dou Dou as they walked back.

"Well, it's just a really scary thing," Dou Dou took the water chestnut, unable to describe exactly what the Evil Ghost Tide was, but it was clearly very terrifying, terrifying enough to give Dou Dou chills just thinking about it. "It's when all the evil ghosts gather together at night to eat people. Villages that encounter the Evil Ghost Tide are basically wiped out... it's just a really scary thing."

She thought for a moment and added, "I heard that only people who are about to die and babies can predict when the Evil Ghost Tide is coming because they can see ghosts... and I heard that wild dogs can too."

"This is still a society that believes in science and Marxism." Xia Ge took a bite of the water chestnut and the crisp, sweet taste exploded in her mouth. For a moment, Xia Ge felt like she had been reborn. She blinked and threw the idea of the Evil Ghost Tide, which violated scientific laws, aside.

Tears streamed down her face as she finally ate something that humans ate! Why didn't she think of this before! Whether she believed in science, Chun Ge, Marxism, or Engels before, her faith now was in water chestnuts!

Water chestnuts!!

Never again would she eat those leafy things! If she kept eating them, she would die! You had to be alive to have faith!

Dou Dou also took a bite and her eyes lit up. "It's delicious!"

"I told you!" Xia Ge boasted, "This is the faith of life!"

"Faith? What?" Dou Dou was confused.

Xia Ge "ah"ed and looked at the water chestnut in her hand that had been bitten in half. "It's... water chestnuts."

Dou Dou immediately understood. "Water chestnuts are faith?"

Xia Ge coughed, feeling guilty for teaching bad things to children. She raised the simplest example, "It's like sometimes I believe in the God of Wealth! If you believe in him, he'll make you rich!"

Dou Dou still didn't quite understand.

Xia Ge was straightforward, "Well, it's just the thing you believe in the most! As long as you believe in it, it can give you strength!"

Dou Dou held the bitten water chestnut and looked at Xia Ge with bright eyes. "Then Shuang Shuang is my faith! Shuang Shuang can find food, Shuang Shuang is very powerful, even more powerful than the village chief. I believe in Shuang Shuang the most! Shuang Shuang can give me strength!"

Xia Ge thought to herself, that's not really what faith is. And she didn't want to be more powerful than the bald village chief.


Xia Ge said, "Actually, when it comes to faith, I recommend the God of Wealth..."

Although she had believed for so long, she hadn't gotten rich. Instead, she became even poorer.

Xia Ge looked at the water chestnuts in her hand. Maybe the God of Wealth was offended that she had just abandoned him a second ago and turned to trust the water chestnuts.

So it's true that faith must be firm, otherwise it won't work at all.

Doudou hugged the water chestnuts, her gaze firm. "No, I don't believe in the God of Wealth. I believe in Shuang Shuang!"

Xia Ge said, "..."

If you're so firm in believing in the God of Wealth, you will definitely get rich...

No... After all that, Doudou still didn't understand what faith was all about, right?

"Hey, look over there, there are fireflies!" Xia Ge's eyes lit up, and she cleverly changed the subject, "Wait for me here, I'll go catch a few."

Did she just talk about this high-end thing called faith? No, she didn't, right? Definitely not! Hmph!

Xia Ge deftly rolled up her sleeves, caught two or three fireflies, and then tied them up with a twig to make a small bag, which she handed to Doudou. "I wanted to catch them a long time ago, hehehe."

Doudou took the bag with the fireflies inside. "They're so bright."

Without any guilt for deceiving a child, Xia Ge laughed, "Yes, they're so bright."

"I like them." Doudou, who was no longer entangled in faith, said, "They're so pretty."

She thought for a moment and said, "Actually, I can't remember a lot of things, but I didn't know what it meant to like something before. I seemed to have done a lot of silly things. Later, I knew what it meant to like something, and I did a lot of silly things again, and drove away the person I liked."

Her voice was a little aggrieved.

Xia Ge thought to herself, what does this little brat who doesn't even know what faith is understand about love and liking? But she expressed sympathy, saying, "...That's really unfortunate for you."

Doudou pursed her lips and smiled, "Uh-huh, so I thought, if I had another chance, I would really like her, give her all the freedom, and I would be good and not make any mistakes."

Xia Ge nodded and thought for a moment, "Then... I wish you get that chance?"

Doudou looked at the fireflies trapped in the small bag, the bright light shining in her eyes like stars, "Uh-huh, I will."

After eating their fill, Xia Ge was feeling a bit sleepy. She yawned and curled up under the crooked neck tree with the remaining water chestnuts. "I'm tired, Doudou."
"Well, those little ones should go to bed early."

"......Mm."

Vaguely, Xia Ge heard Dou Dou's voice murmuring in the night breeze, "Freedom... no wonder... she likes it."

She? The girl Dou Dou likes?

Xia Ge was a little curious, but it seemed to have nothing to do with herself. She decided to wash up and go to sleep.

In the warm night breeze, Xia Ge slept soundly. Meanwhile, the girl named Dou Dou quietly opened the bag, and a few fireflies flew lightly out of the bag, regaining their freedom.

Dou Dou held the bag, still warm from her body heat, against her chest. A gentle look flickered in her innocent eyes.

- This time, she won't make the same mistake again.

If you like someone, you should let them be free.

That's what faith is all about.
