After everyone fled in defeat, the courtyard was in a mess.

The black-clad archers with bows started cleaning up the courtyard.

Xia Ge was fond of her bow and arrow, and when she came back to her senses, she asked in surprise, "Who are these people?"

Xia Ge had seen the black-clad men deliver a letter to Gu Peijiu before, but even if someone delivered a letter, it would only be one person. She didn't think much of it. However, it was intriguing that so many black-clad archers who could shoot arrows so well suddenly appeared.

Gu Peijiu put away Tianzhuling and paused before saying, "They are from the black market."

The black market was a place where you could buy almost anything as long as you had money.

Xia Ge suddenly understood, "So Sister hired them from the black market."

Gu Peijiu: "..."

It wasn't Xia Ge's fault for being slow on the uptake. In Xia Ge's eyes, Gu Peijiu, as the senior disciple of the prestigious Lingxi Danfeng, was glorious, beautiful, sacred, and unparalleled... even if she was a little... cough.

In any case, in Xia Ge's eyes, it was normal for her senior sister to go to the black market to buy something. However, it was a bit exaggerated to say that she was the leader of the black market.

Gu Peijiu said, "No."

Xia Ge was in the process of drawing her bowstring and was slightly taken aback when she was denied, "Huh?"

Gu Peijiu thought for a moment and said, "Do you know the Gu family?"

Xia Ge held her bow, shook her head blankly, "Gu family? A family that hires mercenaries? Is there a separate black market for that?... I've never heard of it."

Gu Peijiu laughed, "Not that one."

Xia Ge's bow was long, about one and a half meters, with a hard black string. It was indeed a good bow.

Gu Peijiu approached and placed her hand on Xia Ge's hand holding the bow. She used the end of the bow to write the word "Gu" neatly on the ground, "This one."

Their hands were together, and the fragrance was faint, warm and soft.

Xia Ge was a little confused, "Gu family?... I haven't heard of it..."

Ah, I want to kiss...

Gu Peijiu thought for a moment, let go of Xia Ge's hand, and smiled, "Never mind then."
"Do you know or not, it's not really necessary."

Xia Ge became curious instead and grabbed Gu Peijiu Rouyi's hand. "Wait, Gu? Which Gu family is that? Your family, Senior Sister?"

It was only after Xia Ge spoke that she realized, after so many years with her Senior Sister, she didn't even know where her family was.

Senior Sister had never mentioned it before.

She inwardly laughed at herself for being silly. Senior Sister wasn't like Sun Wukong who had jumped out of a crack in a stone. She must have a family somewhere.

Perhaps it was because she had been on her own for so long that the concept of family had become faint to her.

Gu Peijiu nodded slightly. "Mm."

Xia Ge suddenly became nervous and heard the system teasing her, "Oh, is the ugly bride going to meet the in-laws?"

Bah, she wasn't ugly!

It was just that Senior Sister was so elegant, and the Gu family was probably a prestigious and scholarly family. She heard that families like that had many rules, and although she wasn't ugly, she...

Xia Ge nervously asked, "Ah... then, Senior Sister's family..."

Gu Peijiu calmly replied, "They're all gone."

Oh, they're all gone...

Xia Ge immediately understood what that meant. Just as she had relaxed for a second, her heart was now back in her throat - they're all gone?!

That must have been so difficult.

For this rollercoaster-like news that made people feel up and down, Xia Ge was caught off guard. She dropped her bow and scratched her head, regretting bringing it up. "I see, Senior Sister..."

No wonder Senior Sister never mentioned her family. She was just like her.

Xia Ge thought for a moment, then hugged Gu Peijiu and rested her head on her shoulder, whispering softly, "Senior Sister, don't be sad, you still have me."

The girl's breath was warm and gentle.

Gu Peijiu patted her head and smiled slightly. "It's okay, it's been a long time."

Xia Ge muttered, "Then, what did Senior Sister want to tell me just now?"
Gu Peijiu spoke concisely: "The Gu family made a name for themselves in the black market."

Xia Ge was taken aback, "Ah?"

Very surprised.

Extremely surprised.

"The black market is Senior Sister's family?" 

Gu Peijiu nodded slightly. Although she didn't think her identity was a big deal, she felt a little uneasy when she thought of her usual behavior on the Lingxi Peak and her image in Xia Ge's heart.

After a pause, she continued, "It's the family business, and I rarely get involved..."

Before she could finish her sentence, Xia Ge said seriously, "Can I not pay when I go to the black market to buy things, Senior Sister?"

Gu Peijiu: "..."

Seeing that Gu Peijiu seemed to be choked up, Xia Ge smirked, "I'm kidding. As the second in command, how can I buy things without paying?"

System: "..."

Okay, in just a moment, she had gone from being a shameless freeloader to the second in command.

She didn't know if her ancestors in the Gu family tomb would be angry if they knew that half of their family property had been taken away by outsiders with just one sentence.

Gu Peijiu tried to change the subject, "It's okay."

Seeing Xia Ge still staring at her, Gu Peijiu added, "From now on... take whatever you like."

System: "..." Fine.

Xia Ge looked at Gu Peijiu and grinned slyly, "No need, no need. I already got my favorite thing."

Gu Peijiu looked up and suddenly felt a darkness in front of her. It turned out to be a fox mask. Xia Ge hugged Gu Peijiu's neck and tied the mask from behind, "Senior Sister gave it to me. It's my favorite thing."

The fragrance was very pleasant.

Xia Ge whispered, "I don't care about the rules... no matter who Senior Sister is, or what her identity is... even if you're a big villain, I will still like you."

"Just like how Senior Sister likes me."
Gu Peiju didn't say anything, lifted her mask and kissed Xia Ge's lips.

Their lips intertwined, tender and affectionate. Xia Ge embraced Gu Peiju's neck, and in between their gasps, she suddenly remembered something important. "Oh? By the way, did Senior Sister know that I bought things in the black market before?"

Gu Peiju stared at Xia Ge's red lips and casually changed the subject, "A few persimmon trees in the courtyard are crooked."

Xia Ge said, "Hey! Look me in the eyes and speak!" She pinched Gu Peiju's pretty face and demanded, "Tell me! Did you already know? Ahhh, I thought the black market was related to the demonic sect!"

Gu Peiju looked around and said, "When my father was alive, he occasionally had some business dealings with the demonic sect."

Xia Ge exclaimed, "Ah, okay, you must have known already - no wonder I always got discounts when buying things!"

Gu Peiju looked at the persimmon trees in the courtyard, and her lips curved slightly.

Following Gu Peiju's gaze, Xia Ge saw the crooked trees and several masked men pulling them back into place. Xia Ge was startled at the sight of the men and asked, "Why are there still people here?"

Gu Peiju said, "It's okay, they can't see us."

Xia Ge thought to herself that she had never heard anyone lie so confidently with their eyes open.

The two of them played and laughed for a while, and when they got tired, Xia Ge pressed Gu Peiju onto the rocking chair and lay on top of her. The chair rocked back and forth, and Xia Ge whispered, "Senior Sister, I feel like you're a little different now."

The black-clothed men who had been cleaning up the courtyard had long since left, and the crooked persimmon trees had been roughly tied back into place. The courtyard was clean and tidy.

Tian Zhuling and Xiao Xiangsi crawled out of the house and played hide-and-seek in the courtyard. Xiao Xiangsi hid in the persimmon tree, and Tian Zhuling slithered around like a red snake, seeming not to have noticed anything.

Gu Peiju said, "Oh?" and calmly asked, "How am I different?"

Xia Ge lay on top of her, nose to nose, eyes to eyes.

"It seems like you're even more powerful than before," Xia Ge thought for a moment and added, "Of course, you were already very powerful before."

Gu Peiju smiled faintly, "Perhaps I had an epiphany after a nap."

Xia Ge pouted, "I sleep every day and haven't had any epiphanies. If you have a secret, share it with me. Don't keep secrets from me."

Gu Peiju sighed as if she had no choice, "Very well... come closer and I'll whisper it to you."
Xia Ge eagerly leaned her ear over.

Gu Peijiu nibbled on her earlobe, her voice soft.

"The Heavenly Secrets... must not be revealed."

Xia Ge: "..."

Xia Ge pouted and pinched Gu Peijiu. "Even Senior Sister makes this kind of joke. Everything that should be leaked has been leaked, so what else can't be revealed..."

As she spoke, she couldn't help but get a little flirtatious. "Am I right?"

Gu Peijiu leisurely slipped her hand into Xia Ge's clothes, but was stopped by Xia Ge. "We can't reveal the Heavenly Secrets in broad daylight!"

Gu Peijiu kissed her. "What about now?"

Xia Ge blushed. "Still no, it's indecent... there are children around."

Children?

Gu Peijiu followed Xia Ge's gaze and saw the little Xiangsi peeking out from the persimmon tree. "..."

Gu Peijiu looked away and continued to explore. The girl's skin was soft and smooth, like a piece of warm jade, truly addictive.

After staring at the persimmon tree for a while and seeing no movement from Tianzhu Ling, Xiangsi couldn't help but sneak out from the dense green leaves and listen in on their conversation.

A red dot in a sea of green, who else could she catch if not you?

In the next moment, a red light flashed and the fine red silk wrapped the little red ribbon into a small red dumpling, which then fell from the tree. Tianzhu Ling was wrapped inside and rolled around in the freshly fertilized soil.

"Wait, there's something different." Xia Ge blushed and stopped Gu Peijiu's wandering hand. She thought for a moment and observed Gu Peijiu's eyes, a little perplexed. "The Senior Sister now... always reminds me of a dream."

Gu Peijiu's heart skipped a beat, but her face remained calm. "Oh?"

"I don't know if it was a dream or not." Xia Ge said, "When I was still wandering around, I once passed by a Rain God Temple."

"...I thought I was going to starve to death." She buried her head in Gu Peijiu's chest and listened to her steady heartbeat, as if each beat gave her the courage to face everything that had happened in the past.

"But after I woke up... it was like a dream, suddenly there was so much food."
"..."

The sound of her heartbeat remained steady.

"Actually, at that time, I felt like my life was meaningless. I was only living for the sake of a promise to someone, so I tried my best to keep going."

"But that day, I really felt like I couldn't hold on anymore."

"No hope, no light."

Gu Peiju listened quietly, brushing her hand through the girl's dark hair, silently in her heart.

"So I always felt like the time at the Rain God Temple was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me in my life. No matter who it was... it made me realize that in this world, as long as you hold on a little longer, there is always hope."

After she finished speaking, she looked into Gu Peiju's eyes.

Her senior sister's eyes were warm.

Just like the woman in the White Dream Cave, who wore a black cloak and kissed her forehead, was gentle.

She stared into Gu Peiju's eyes. "So, if possible, I really want to thank the Rain God of that night in person."

"...Thank her for giving me the courage to keep going."

Gu Peiju heard her words and felt complicated in her heart. She felt like there were a thousand words she wanted to say, but didn't know where to start.

The past is gone, this body has lived for a hundred years.

Five hundred years ago, Xia Wushuang created the Evil Spirit Mountain, and after fifty years of repentance, her spirit and soul were destroyed.

Perhaps her spirit and soul were not afraid of destruction.

But at that time, Gu Peiju could no longer feel Xia Wushuang's soul. Besides her spirit and soul being destroyed, she didn't care about anything else.

Fifty years were so long, but by that time, everyone had already come to terms with it.

It's just that no one went to find anyone.

One was because she felt unworthy, the other was because of deep love but no words.

It wasn't until she stood in front of Xia Wushuang's grave that she finally remembered everything about her time as "Dou Dou".
Same soul, different people.

But no matter what.

She lived for this person, and perhaps she would die for this person.

But a puppet named Wu Di Kui found her and left her a fragment of Xia Wu Shuang's soul, telling her to wait until the era when the true son of destiny is born and find the most suitable person to be reborn.

"What is the most suitable person?"

"...Xia Wu Shuang once changed the fate of the Chu king, and also released the reverse god that should have been saved by the son of destiny 500 years later, injuring the son of destiny's luck, and thus receiving divine punishment."

"...If you want to save her, you must find the opposite person of the son of destiny five hundred years later."

"That is the 'most suitable person'."

Qin Shuang is the opposite of Ye Ze's destiny, destined to be a stepping stone on the way forward for the son of destiny. Coincidentally, this is also the only way for Xia Wu Shuang, who is on the brink of soul extinction, to be reborn.

Gu Peijiu still remembers that at that time, the soul fragment in her hand was very small and fragile.

It seemed that if she didn't protect it well, it would disappear without a trace.

And the familiar breath among them almost made her unable to help but shed tears.

Gu Peijiu cherished the fragment and asked softly, "Who are you?"

"It doesn't matter who I am...it's a pity, I can only do this." Wu Di Kui, using the body of the puppet, spoke stiffly, "I forcibly sent her soul back to where it should belong before it dissipated, and thus suffered punishment..."

"You must wait until that day...before that, you must protect it well..."

Then, the puppet turned into a pile of fragments in front of Xia Wu Shuang's tomb.

A lost deer came over and nudged the fragments with its head, then looked at her.

Xia Wu Shuang set up her own tomb on the back mountain of Lingxi Peak, with a lost deer on one side and a deer on the other side of the Evil Spirit Mountain.

And the "it" mentioned by Wu Di Kui is the soul fragment left to Gu Peijiu. The reason why it must be protected well is because Xia Wu Shuang's soul is the object of calamity and heavenly law's close attention, and whoever holds it will be punished by heaven.

And Gu Peijiu continuously protected this fragment from various heavenly calamities, the hardships of which cannot be described.

She waited for this person for five hundred years.
Actually, it's not a big deal.

It's just that the heavenly punishment is easy to endure, but the longing is difficult to bear.

But fortunately...

Finally, there was no disappointment.

Five hundred years later, Qin Shuang appeared, and her shattered soul was reborn. Shattered soul rebirth is not simple. Half of Gu Peijiu's soul was reincarnated as a girl from the Gu family, and the other half of her soul was unstable, sometimes unclear and sometimes clear. Sometimes she would put herself in a puppet, and sometimes she would live for a while in the body of a dying person. Occasionally, she would even be born in the wrong place, confused and confused until she opened her eyes and became a girl from the Gu family.

Adapting was extremely difficult.

But no matter what, she knew what she had to do.

And there was a hidden expectation in her heart, born because of that person.

She also wanted to... become human.

Not a lofty god, nor a puppet who could only look at her back. She wanted to become someone who could hold that person's hand and walk with him all the way.

But before she even calculated Qin Shuang's existence, half of her chaotic soul protected that shard. Later, when calamities suddenly stopped appearing, she had a slight respite, but she did not want it to be because calamities had already found Qin Shuang ahead of time. At that time, she did not understand why, but just now, when the Chang family and the calamities appeared at the same time... upon careful thought, it should be that at that time, calamities had already parasitized on the young Qin Shuang with the help of the Chang family's power.

Later, when she calculated Qin Shuang's fate, Qin Shuang had already been killed along with her mother to exterminate the Ye family. She was being chased by righteous people and wandering the streets, but still under the control of calamities, killing like a maniac, and her soul had long been devoured by calamities.

She fought against calamities with half of her soul and was evenly matched with Qin Shuang, who was young but the legitimate daughter of a priest with unparalleled natural spiritual power. With Qin Shuang's spiritual power, calamities were like a tiger with wings added, and in the end, the two were equally injured.

As the body of a heavenly-level puppet and with the Wenqing Sword in hand, Gu Peijiu was extremely difficult to deal with for calamities. However, it used its last bit of strength to use a killing move, opening the Bai Meng acupoint, hoping to directly seal her inside. Gu Peijiu simply abandoned her puppet body and the Wenqing Sword, and gave all her soul power to calamities with a heavy blow. In the end, she slightly gained the upper hand, and calamities fled in a sorry state. But she herself had no more strength left, and her soul power was damaged by more than half. The only thing she remembered clearly was putting the soul shard into Qin Shuang's body, and when she woke up again, she only remembered her name was "Dou Dou," with very few other memories.

...As for what happened after that, it's better not to mention it.

As for the time at the Rain God Temple...

Gu Peijiu sighed lightly and said to Xia Ge, "It's all in the past."

Tianzhu Ling quietly rolled herself into the water tank to wash herself clean, and Xiaoxiangsi also emerged from the tank, shaking off the water on her body and mischievously trying to shake it all onto Tianzhu Ling. But Tianzhu Ling maliciously pressed her underwater with her tail.

Xiaoxiangsi gurgled and gurgled underwater, like a red water plant, but no matter how much she gurgled, she couldn't get out from under Tianzhu Ling's Five-Finger Mountain. In the end, she gave up struggling.

Tianzhu Ling quietly lifted her tail.

"Swish--"
The tiny Xiaoxiangsi jumped out of the water like a fish, splashing countless water droplets onto Tianzhuling's body. Then, proudly shaking off the water, it quickly ran to Xia Ge's arms like it had found a refuge. It raised its tail and showed off to Tianzhuling.

Tianzhuling climbed out of the water tank, feeling dejected. She shook off the water from her body and folded herself under Gu Peiju's hand, feeling wronged.

Who is the boss? It's crystal clear.

Xia Ge picked up Xiaoxiangsi and asked, "What are you doing?"
