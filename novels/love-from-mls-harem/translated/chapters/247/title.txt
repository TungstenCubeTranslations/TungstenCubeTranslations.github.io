Chapter 243: The Scapegoat

In the dimly lit interrogation room, the suspect sat nervously, fidgeting with their hands. The detective across from them leaned forward, his eyes fixed intently on the suspect.

"Tell me the truth," he said sternly. "Did you commit this crime?"

The suspect shook their head vigorously. "No, I swear I didn't do it. I'm being framed!"

The detective raised an eyebrow. "Framed? By whom?"

The suspect hesitated for a moment before speaking. "By my boss. He has it out for me, and I think he planted the evidence to make it look like I did it."

The detective leaned back in his chair, considering this. It wasn't the first time he had heard such a claim. In his years on the force, he had seen many innocent people accused of crimes they didn't commit, simply because they were an easy target.

But in this case, the evidence was pretty damning. The victim's blood was found on the suspect's clothes, and the murder weapon was found in their possession. It was going to be hard to prove their innocence.

The detective sighed. "Look, I understand that you're scared and you want to clear your name. But right now, the evidence is against you. We need to investigate further and see if there's any truth to your claim of being framed."

The suspect nodded, tears welling up in their eyes. "Please, detective. You have to believe me. I didn't do it. I'm just a scapegoat."

The detective gave them a sympathetic look. "I'll do what I can, but you need to be patient. Justice takes time."
