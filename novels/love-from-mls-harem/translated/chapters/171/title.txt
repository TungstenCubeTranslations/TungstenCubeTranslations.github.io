Chapter 167 Are You in Pain? [Angst] (2)

The room was filled with a suffocating silence. The only sound was the sound of breathing, but even that was barely audible. The atmosphere was tense, as if a single wrong move would cause everything to fall apart.

Guo Jing sat on the sofa with his head lowered, his hands clasped tightly together. He didn't dare to look at Huang Rong, afraid of what he might see in her eyes.

Huang Rong stood in front of him, her arms crossed over her chest. She was staring at him with a cold, piercing gaze, as if she was trying to read his thoughts.

After what seemed like an eternity, Huang Rong finally spoke. "Guo Jing, tell me the truth. Are you in love with her?"

Guo Jing's heart skipped a beat. He knew exactly who Huang Rong was referring to. "Rong'er, I..."

Huang Rong interrupted him. "Don't call me Rong'er. Answer my question."

Guo Jing took a deep breath. "Yes, I am in love with her."

Huang Rong's expression softened slightly. "I see."

Guo Jing looked up at her, hoping to see some kind of understanding in her eyes. But all he saw was disappointment and sadness.

"I never thought you would betray me like this," Huang Rong said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I trusted you, Guo Jing. I thought you loved me."

"I do love you, Rong'er," Guo Jing said, his voice filled with emotion. "But I also love her. I don't know what to do."

Huang Rong shook her head. "You have to choose, Guo Jing. You can't have both of us."

Guo Jing hung his head in despair. He knew she was right. He couldn't continue living like this, torn between two women. He had to make a choice, no matter how painful it might be.
