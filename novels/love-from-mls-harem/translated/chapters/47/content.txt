When Xia Ge rushed over here, she didn't have much hope. Her original plan was to snatch a furnace and refine the pill to prove her strength as an inner disciple. She would take care of the procedures later.

But when she was close to the entrance of the venue and heard her name, Xia Ge was shocked. In her haste, she couldn't brake in time and rushed into the air, causing an embarrassing scene of a black ball appearing out of nowhere.

After a perfect 360-degree somersault in the air, Xia Ge vaguely felt that the wound on her abdomen seemed to have torn to a new height.

...It doesn't hurt at all.

But...embarrassment aside, tearing aside, these can be dealt with later.

At least she made it on time.

Looking at the young girl in red and white maple clothes sitting on the stage and Ye Ze next to her, Xia Ge couldn't help but smile brightly.

- There is hope for her pension insurance!

Excited!

"Dandan 556th generation, 88th outer disciple Xia Wuyin, pays respects to senior sister!"

The young girl on the stage was cold and expressionless, with a porcelain-like face, and her voice was cold.

"Find your position and get ready to start."

"Yes!"

Xia Ge straightened her back and quickly found the 124th furnace.

It seems that senior sister helped her register...

It really is...

For the first time, she felt the happiness of being backstage and having a powerful supporter.

Xia Ge walked all the way, feeling like she was dragging a torn sack and her body was numb and stiff. Her wound was faintly painful, and her condition was extremely poor. She walked to the side of the furnace and felt someone looking at her. She glanced sideways and saw the young man in linen clothes.

The boy had a red hairband on his head, his eyes were pitch black, staring straight ahead, unable to see his pupils, and his expression was stiff. He exuded an aura that kept people away.

Xia Ge's position was on his right side, but the person looking at her was not the boy, but the girl on his left side. She had been staring at her, as if there was something on her face.

She turned her head to look at the girl, feeling very familiar, but couldn't remember where she had seen her before.
The other person stared at her shamelessly without any embarrassment, and when Xia Ge noticed, the person didn't feel awkward at all. Instead, they looked even more confident.

Xia Ge withdrew her gaze expressionlessly.

{Xiao Kui.}

System: "Hmm?"

Xia Ge asked deeply: {Am I now full of the rumored sickly beauty? The kind that is particularly attractive?}

System: "......"

If the system had hands, it really wanted to slap Xia Ge's face without hesitation to make her see reality.

After a while, the girl who had been staring at her finally spoke.

"...Hey, you." She hesitated for a moment and shouted from a distance, "...Aren't you called Xia Ge?"

Xia Ge suddenly turned her head to stare at her: "!!!?"

Damn, who are you?! You actually know her real name?! Are you a human or a ghost!

The girl named Mao Qing looked at her, thin lips slightly pursed. "I remember you. You used to be called Xia Wu Yin."

Seeing Xia Ge's expression like she had seen a ghost, Mao Qing suddenly felt insulted. She stomped her foot, extremely annoyed. "You don't remember me?! I'm Chang Lu..."

Xia Ge was shocked: "Damn, you're Chang Lu?!! Does the pill have a gender-changing effect?!"

Unbelievable!

Mao Qing was also anxious, her small face turning red. "I'm not Chang Lu!! My name is Mao Qing! I..."

Seeing Xia Ge's confused expression, Mao Qing swallowed her breath. "Anyway - whether you remember or not, thank you for that time!"

She twisted her clothes, the last sentence sounding extremely awkward.

Thinking of Chang Lu, Xia Ge stared at her for a long time before she remembered who she was. "Oh...it's you."

Huo Bai, who was sandwiched in the middle, put the materials on the table one by one from his sleeve without expression.

After a while, he seemed to have taken the wrong material, glanced at it, and hurriedly put it back into his sleeve.
Xia Ge glanced over unintentionally.

Mao Qing pursed her lips and said, "Are you here to participate in the competition too? Doesn't Senior Sister value you a lot? You're so outstanding, why do you still need to participate in the competition?"

Xia Ge came back to her senses and asked, "What did she say?"

The system's voice was cold, "Host, she's praising you for being outstanding."

Xia Ge pretended to be weak and asked, "Say it again? What's going on, Xiao Kui? Is your transmission system malfunctioning or am I losing too much blood and can't hear clearly?"

The system restrained itself and said, "Host, she said you're outstanding."

Xia Ge asked, "Ah? What? Say the first two words and the last two words again? Hey, Xiao Kui, your transmission system really needs an upgrade. I can't hear it clearly."

The system said, "Host is garbage, did you hear it clearly this time?"

Xia Ge coughed and said as if nothing had happened, "Ah yes, I am very outstanding indeed. However, even talented geniuses need a stage."

Xia Ge lowered her voice and said with conviction, "Yes, truly outstanding people need a stage, not a backstage."

The system thought, bullshit, you wouldn't have a stage without me registering you. Who the hell are you to call yourself a genius?

Mao Qing pursed her lips and said, "But no matter how outstanding you are, I will be the leader this time!"

Xia Ge smiled and said, "Unfortunately, my goal is also to be the first. So we are opponents, let's work hard, Miss Mao."

Huo Bai, who was sandwiched in the middle, thought to himself, "..."

"Prepare your materials! The competition is about to begin!"

The voice of the Danfeng Inner Sect disciple on stage was serious and clear. Xia Ge withdrew her gaze and slowly took out the materials that Senior Sister had given her from the Flowing Silver Ring. There was a small table in front of the cauldron with a small scale and other auxiliary alchemy tools. She carefully checked each material on the scale to make sure there were no mistakes. At first, it was fine, but halfway through the check, Xia Ge felt dizzy, her fingers trembled slightly, and the scale shook, causing the rope to tilt and two numbers to be misaligned.

Xia Ge shook her head, put down the materials, and supported the table with both hands, closing her eyes to let the dizziness pass.

Mao Qing was weighing the materials and feeling a bit complex. On one hand, Xia Ge was her competitor, on the other hand, she was her lifesaver. She couldn't help but glance at Xia Ge more often. With this glance, she saw Xia Ge supporting the table with closed eyes and a pale face.

No... in fact, Xia Ge's face had never looked good. At first, she thought Xia Ge had naturally pale skin, but now with the cold sweat on her forehead, she looked a little unwell.
Mao Qing thought about the medical expenses that the other party had helped her with, as well as the incident where Chang Lu made the disciple of Dan Feng kneel down. In the end, her concern overcame her competitiveness, "Hey, what's wrong with you? Are you okay?"

Xia Ge took a moment to recover before opening her eyes to answer Mao Qing's question.

Xia Ge: "Don't disturb me, I was just feeling the spiritual energy of heaven and earth."

System: "..."

Huo Bai, caught in the middle, thought to himself: "..."

Mao Qing, who had fed her concern to the village's big dog, responded with an expressionless "oh" and turned back to weighing the materials. She gritted her teeth as she weighed, not knowing why she was angry, but she was definitely angry.

Feeling the spiritual energy of heaven and earth while trying to refine a Qi-gathering pill? Are you trying to refine a Profound-grade Qi-gathering pill? That's impossible!

Of course, Xia Ge wasn't really feeling the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. She was actually feeling dizzy due to excessive blood loss.

Although she made it to the competition, things were still very... bad.

"Ah... Xiao Gui, do I still have points?"

System: "No, you used the ten points you earned from refining the pill to buy the Potential Gun."

Xia Ge felt a bit dizzy: "That's a good thing... if only I could use it on myself again..."

System: "Wake up, you can't use the Potential Gun frequently. Overusing it will bring unimaginable pressure to your body's potential, you could only use it in your peak state after refining the Red Blood Qi-gathering Pill. Using it in your current condition is just asking for death."

Asking for death? Who's Zhao Si?

Xia Ge instinctively responded: "Ah, Zhao Si? Nicholas Zhao Si? Actually, my name is Lei Feng..."

System: "..."

After a moment, Xia Ge realized what she had said and exclaimed, "Ah, my name is Xia Wu Yin."

System: "You should withdraw from the competition or delay it. Your current condition is too... dangerous."
Xia Ge felt a bit moved in her heart. "Is Xiao Kui worried about me?"

The system decided to tell the truth: "I'm just worried that you might accidentally blow up the furnace and harm the fish in the pond."

Xia Ge decided to feed her own emotions to the black wolf dog that looked as stupid as a husky in the village.

"Heh, excellent geniuses won't blow up the furnace."

Xia Ge shook her head and looked up at the sky for a while, then couldn't help but look at the person next to her.

"Hey," she shouted, "what's your name?"

After being inexplicably called out, Huo Bai glanced at her, his fist clenched slightly under his sleeve, and his face expressionless. "Huo Bai."

"Must be an illusion...why do I feel like I've seen you somewhere before?"

The system said, "Host, this way of hitting on someone has been outdated for eight hundred years. You're embarrassing yourself."

"Xiao Kui, this is where you're wrong. In terms of technology, this era is probably a few thousand years behind my era. This way of hitting on someone that has been outdated for eight hundred years in my time happens to be advanced here by a few thousand years."

"..."

"So you're hitting on him, right?!" Even if Xiao Kui said that, he didn't seem to believe it very much. But it's still better to say it out of humanitarianism and self-defense.

"No...I just feel like he looks familiar," Xia Ge silently explained in her heart.

Huo Bai glanced at her. "Then you might have remembered it wrong. I'm a new disciple recruited from outside the village. I'm not an outer disciple, and this is my first time here."

Xia Ge scratched her head and laughed, "It's okay, I often forget people...I mean, can I borrow a piece of candy from the pocket in your sleeve? No, lend me a piece, I'll return it to you."

Mao Qing: "..."

System: "..."

How the hell did you know there's candy in his pocket!

Huo Bai's face turned red instantly. "I don't have any!"
Xia Ge looked serious and said, "Yes, I saw it when you just got the material. It's from Jinjiang Sugar Shop at the foot of the mountain! It's peppermint flavor!"

System: "......"
