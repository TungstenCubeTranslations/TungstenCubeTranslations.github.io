The Qingqing sword at her waist was scorching hot, as if suppressing something. Xia Wushuang was stunned, and Lan Lu nudged her shoulder and let out two cries.

Only then did she come back to her senses.

It was already dawn.

She left the village that was washed with blood and randomly chose a direction to walk in a daze.

The neighboring villages were all in a panic, and by the time she arrived, it was already a scene of people moving out.

Without needing to inquire, Xia Wushuang knew why. From afar, she could already hear the clamor of voices.

"Hurry, hurry, hurry—the evil ghost tide is coming!"

"Where should we move to now..."

"Let's seek refuge with our relatives..."

"..."

The evil ghost tide?

Was the thing just now called the evil ghost tide?

The evil ghost tide appeared after Xia Wushuang was locked up by Gu Peiju, so although she found it terrifying, she didn't know what it was.

She stood at the entrance of the village, not moving. A man came out carrying a heavy burden on his back. Xia Wushuang took a deep breath and pretended to ask innocently, "What are you all doing?"

The man was huge with a fierce face and a pair of tiger-like eyes. When he saw her blocking the way, he snarled impatiently, "Helping people move their things! What else?"

So it was carrying things.

Xia Wushuang smiled awkwardly while holding the two deer, "Oh, then...Can I ask you something?"

The man put down the burden on his back with a heavy thud. It didn't look light inside. He grunted, "Ask."

Xia Wushuang was a little surprised. She thought this man wouldn't bother with her.

The man impatiently said, "Are you going to ask or not?"

"Why are they moving out?" Xia Wushuang asked.
The man looked at her with a dumbfounded expression and spoke in a harsh tone, "The village to the east has been hit by an evil spirit tide, no one can live here anymore. Are we going to feed the ghosts if we don't move?!"

Xia Wushuang asked the question she most wanted to know, "What is an evil spirit tide?"

The man looked her up and down and suddenly asked, "Are you from overseas?"

The place was far from Lingxi Peak, but close to the sea, so it was no wonder he asked.

"…Sort of," Xia Wushuang replied.

The man then understood. Although his tone was not good, he didn't have the same ferocity as before. "No wonder you don't know anything. The evil spirit tide appeared a month ago. No one knows what it is, but wherever it goes, it leaves behind only blood. Not a single person survives."

A month ago…?

Xia Wushuang thought of the scene she saw yesterday and felt a bit uneasy in her stomach.

"They say it's because the Lingxi Peak sect leader made puppets against the natural order, so this punishment was brought down. I don't know if it's true or not…" Xia Wushuang's face turned grey.

"Everyone says so anyway." The man sighed and shook his head, then picked up his heavy burden and left. As people left one by one, the villagers' faces were weathered with confusion about where to go next. No one paid any attention to her.

She led two blue deer and stood to the side, feeling a bit lost and embarrassed about not knowing what to do.

…Was this what Gu Peijiu was worried about before?

Why didn't she want to tell her anything when there were already so many problems outside?

Xia Wushuang thought of the old man again and took out a red talisman from her sleeve. She infused a bit of spiritual energy into it.

In an instant, the golden lines on the red talisman lit up, emitting a harmonious and peaceful aura that carried a sense of inexplicable calmness.

As if the soul had been comforted.

Xia Wushuang looked at the red talisman in her hand and then at the people who had been driven away by evil spirits, as if she had gained some insight.

She left the bustling village, where people were busy moving, and came to a slightly more prosperous small town. She found a restaurant and ordered a bowl of tea. When the waiter brought the tea, he gave her a strange look. If it weren't for her high-quality silk clothes, Xia Wushuang had no doubt he would have kicked her out.
But she had long stopped caring about these things. After the tea was served, she didn't touch it, but instead listened carefully to the discussions around her.

Although the discussions of the people around her revolved around Lingxi Peak and the Evil Ghost Tide, there were also some fresh news.

For example, the Chu King had conquered the last small country and was ready to ascend to the throne and become the new emperor.

Or, the Red-clothed Girl of Lingxi Peak had fought with the first puppet under Xia Wushuang's command.

"..."

Xia Wushuang's hand shook, and the water in her teacup almost spilled out.

The tea was really just tea, with not even a single tea leaf inside. She took a sip, put the cup back, ordered a pot of good wine, and joined the people who were discussing.

She suppressed her anger and smiled lightly.

"It is said that seeing each other is like being brothers... I am not talented, and I cannot live up to the word 'brother' with you gentlemen. But good wine should be shared with those who appreciate it."

The waiter brought the wine over attentively.

It was a thousand liang of good wine, but Xia Wushuang didn't even bat an eye when she ordered it.

The people at the table were obviously people from the martial arts world. They all had rough faces, but their personalities were straightforward. They could tell at a glance that Xia Wushuang was a hidden master of the internal martial arts, and that she was quick and decisive when she took action. When she ordered the most expensive wine in the restaurant, they didn't have any bad thoughts and all said, "Good wine and a beautiful woman! Great!"

"I can't live up to it, I can't live up to it." Xia Wushuang smiled and, after sharing the wine with everyone, asked, "I just heard you guys talking about Lingxi Peak. Has anything bad happened recently?"

"Ah, it's all because of that Xia Wushuang." A thin man sighed.

Xia Wushuang was used to hearing her name from other people's mouths by now. She even asked with a smile, "What happened to her again?"

"The Evil Ghost Tide is one thing, and it probably has nothing to do with her. And I don't really believe in divine punishment and all that. But this person played a great trick for the Chu King and turned the world's remains into puppets. She didn't even give anyone a chance to react!"

Xia Wushuang drank her wine expressionlessly. This was really unfair to her. She didn't know at the time...

Well, in the end, she shouldn't have brought out something she wasn't sure of.

It was just that at that time...

Thinking of the letter from the Chu King ten years ago, Xia Wushuang shook her head.

If it was the Chu King, she... would probably still do the same thing.
Beside her, a man chuckled, "Heroes arise in troubled times, and Xia Wushuang is also a capable person."

The thin man finished his drink and sighed, "Truly good wine - what you said is true. There are many capable people in this world, but only this one dares to make a name for herself."

Suddenly, someone interjected, "Heh."

It was unclear whether they were agreeing or disagreeing.

Another person spoke up, "It's been chaotic at the Lingxi Peak these days. I heard that those two people are fighting so fiercely that the world around them is obscured by dust and sand. It's likely that they still haven't determined a winner."

Upon hearing this, Xia Wushuang's heart skipped a beat. "Those two people, are they the ones you were talking about just now?"

"Yes, Xia Wushuang's first puppet, Baiyi Kugu Gu Peijiu, and the little girl who is often by her side... I never thought that the little girl who is usually unknown would be so powerful in a fight."

"Lingxi Peak really has hidden dragons and crouching tigers..."

The two of them actually fought each other? Xia Wushuang stood up abruptly, causing her chair to fall. Seeing that everyone was looking at her, she sheepishly picked up the chair and sat back down. "Sorry... I've always admired Miss Gu Peijiu by Xia Wushuang's side..."

The man who spoke earlier sneered, "That's normal. Although she's a puppet, she's more famous than most people. Baiyi Kugu Gu Peijiu, who in this world doesn't know her? Not to mention the nobles in Chang'an, there are also many girls like you who like her."

Xia Wushuang was surprised. She only just realized that the person they were referring to was Gu Peijiu, and she even had a nickname, "Baiyi Kugu"? White clothes she could understand, but what was with the "Kugu" (dry bones)? It was too strange... And Gu Peijiu was such a beautiful girl, how could "dry bones" be appropriate?

"This 'Kugu' is the name of her weapon. It is said that this girl once used a bone flute to command an army of 30,000 puppets, and in one night, she defeated the enemy army. There's also a joke that says her master, Xia Wushuang, was still asleep in bed while Baiyi Kugu conquered a thousand miles of territory for the Chu army. When Xia Wushuang woke up, she was taken home by someone, and when she woke up at Lingxi Peak, she thought it was all a dream of going to war... Hahaha, it's really funny!"

Xia Wushuang: "..."

Did that really happen? What nonsense!

Seeing the other person's confident expression, Xia Wushuang subconsciously tried to remember... A few years ago... It seemed that there was such an incident. At that time, the King of Chu asked her to help attack a small country called Manye. She took Gu Peijiu and the puppet army and ran thousands of miles to scout the enemy camp. Seeing that the enemy had no plans to attack, they went back to sleep and planned to attack the next day.

When she woke up, she was already at Lingxi Peak.

She was still foolishly asking the person next to her, "Hey, didn't we go to Manye to fight?"

The maid looked at her with a strange look in her eyes. "...It's already over."

Xia Wushuang: "...How did it end?"
The maid pretended to be angry and said, "The other party is very despicable, actually launching a night attack!"

Xia Wushuang thought, a night attack is too normal...a night attack?!

Xia Wushuang was startled and asked, "And then?"

The maid replied, "The leader Gu made her cry, lost a thousand miles of territory. Don't worry, Master, you can continue sleeping, it's still early."

Although this incident caused some psychological trauma to Xia Wushuang, after ten years of experiencing various battles, most of which she did not experience personally, she preferred to do puppet research in the rear. She couldn't remember such a small matter if she didn't think about it carefully.

The man saw her pondering and said in surprise, "Haven't you heard? Although this happened a bit early, it's true. For ten years, countless puppet expeditions were researched by Xia Wushuang in the back, while Gu Peiju fought on her behalf."

Remembering that it was true, Xia Wushuang said embarrassedly, "I believe it, I believe it..."

"But because no one knows the name of that flute, only that it's a white bone, it was named the White Clothes Dried Bones."

Xia Wushuang couldn't help but say, "That flute is called the Bone Mourning."

The man laughed and thought she was joking, "Miss, that's a good name you've given!"

Xia Wushuang thought to herself, it really is called the Bone Mourning.

After chatting for a while, the man in the green clothes who said "Heroes are born in troubled times" asked her, "What's your name?"

Xia Wushuang replied, "I don't have much reputation, you can call me Shuangwu."

The system said, "Why don't you call yourself Sanwu?"

Xia Wushuang replied, "That's you."

Having learned what she wanted to know, Xia Wushuang didn't want to waste any more time. She had to hurry back to Lingxi Peak to check the situation.

Su Chan and Gu Peiju had never gotten along. Gu Peiju had locked her up before, which had already caused Su Chan's displeasure. Now that they were fighting, Xia Wushuang was not surprised.

"Good name, good name." For a while, all the men laughed. Xia Wushuang asked, "I don't know where you all are going to fight?"

She was just looking for a reason to leave, this was just a casual question.
"I heard that the King of Chu will ascend to the throne in a few days, and we should go to Chang'an..." a man was saying, but another person gave him a signal with his eyes, and without words, they understood each other. The man paused and smiled, "Let's go to Chang'an to join in the fun."

"I see... then be careful on your journey," Xia Wushuang was preoccupied with the matter of Lingxi Peak and did not notice their unusual behavior. After being polite and leaving the wine behind, she paid the bill and left the small town with two deer in tow.

At the city gate, an old ragged man was huddled in a corner, looking unremarkable.

Xia Wushuang saw him at a glance, and took the two deer over to him. Looking at the broken porcelain bowl in front of the old man with scattered coins, she couldn't help but say, "Do all recluses like to pretend to be poor?"

The blind old man said, "It's nothing compared to the way Xia Sect Leader spends money."

"I also invite you to come to the restaurant and have a little drink? Instead of keeping everything a secret all the time," Xia Wushuang said.

This old man was the blind old man she had met before.

The old man shook his head, "The old man doesn't drink."

Xia Wushuang was helpless, "Alright, then take your two deer away. It's not convenient for me to keep them."

Although there were many strange people and things here, she still attracted attention while walking around with two blue deer. Xia Wushuang always believed in being low-key and doing things in a high-profile manner.

The old man said, "I can't manage other things, but you must take these deer with you."

Xia Wushuang laughed, "Are you trying to cheat me?"

The old man shook his head, "I'm doing it for the sake of the people."

Xia Wushuang said, "Alright, what kind of deer is this, and what can it do? Lingxi Peak doesn't keep useless things. Can you tell me how many pounds it can pull?"

The old man was speechless.

But he still kindly said, "This deer is called 'Lost', it can guide lost souls back to the right path, and also suppress evil spirits."

Xia Wushuang pointed to herself and said, "Do I look like a lost soul to you?"

The old man said, "I can't see."

Xia Wushuang said, "Okay."

"I know you want to ask me about the evil ghost tide," the old man paused and said, "I can tell you, but you must promise me to take these two deer with you wherever you go."
Xia Wushuang: "Your conditions are making it difficult for me..."

She couldn't just bring two deer with her everywhere she went, right? It sounded a bit strange.

The old man remained silent.

Xia Wushuang reluctantly compromised when she wanted to ask the old man about the Evil Ghost Tide: "Okay, I promise you."

Only then did the old man speak, "It is rumored that the Evil Ghost Tide is the heavenly punishment you received as a cultivator for interfering in worldly affairs without authorization. Actually, that's not true. Although you did receive heavenly punishment, it was not the Evil Ghost Tide."

Xia Wushuang looked at him puzzled, "I received heavenly punishment? Is it true that there is heavenly punishment?"

Heavenly punishment was a curse.

The old man spoke slowly, "You see, you're lost now."

Xia Wushuang: "..."

"Although this is not your heavenly punishment, there is still a reason for it. This shouldn't be heavenly punishment. To be precise, it's your karma." The old man's voice became serious, "Do you know what caused the formation of the Evil Ghost Tide?"

"Of course, it's ghosts," Xia Wushuang said.

The old man said, "The Evil Ghost Tide can be said to have suddenly appeared overnight, washing several villages with blood, seemingly without any signs. Where did so many evil ghosts come from in one night?"

Xia Wushuang was not stupid. For a moment, she seemed to have connected something, but she was not sure. Her heart began to beat slightly, "Where did they come from?"

"It was the puppets you made," the old man said lightly. "I can tell you that without cultivation, mortals will always be mortals. Therefore, their bodies will perish and their souls will also perish if they do not undergo reincarnation. "

Xia Wushuang's pupils shrank slightly.

"The puppets you made can carry souls, which is indeed unparalleled," the old man praised Xia Wushuang's craftsmanship, "but you overlooked one thing: they are mortals."

"..." Xia Wushuang had a vague feeling that something was wrong. "So?"

"The reason why people need to reincarnate is precisely because the strength of their souls cannot allow them to exist in the mortal world forever," the old man said. "When the soul is just worn down to the point where it can undergo reincarnation, it will leave the body and enter the six realms, strengthening the soul's power through reincarnation and allowing them to continue to be reborn. ... That's why some babies can see ghosts, but they will gradually lose this ability as they grow older."

"If the mortal soul lingers in the mortal world, everything in the mortal world will continue to wear down the soul's power. Once they lose the best opportunity for reincarnation, they will have two outcomes: either their souls will disperse, or they will turn into evil ghosts, devouring mortals to continue to exist."

"You made the dying souls that should have gone through reincarnation come back to life in puppets, which made them lose the best opportunity for reincarnation."


Xia Wushuang stood in place, feeling lost for the first time.

"So, the shattered souls' will to survive turned them into evil spirits, which became the wave of soul-devouring demons."

"...You changed the rules on your own." The old man slowly brushed off the dust from his body. "But you cannot create new laws."

"Think about it carefully, what everyone else says isn't wrong."

"People cannot be brought back to life. Since you did it, this is your punishment."

A long time passed.

Xia Wushuang's heart was in turmoil, clenching and unclenching her fist in her sleeve several times before finally asking, "What should I do?"

Her voice was calm, seemingly without any ripples.

The old man said, "Are you asking me?"

Xia Wushuang nodded seriously. "Yes, I'm asking you. What should I do?"

She even used honorifics.

The old man sighed lightly. "Your existence was originally a mistake."

Xia Wushuang didn't say anything.

"But you don't have to blame yourself too much." The old man slowly said, "In the end, all of this is just a mistake derived from another mistake."

"So, you mean I shouldn't exist?" Xia Wushuang's voice was flat, without any emotion.

The old man didn't say anything, but there was a hint of approval in his eyes.

Xia Wushuang smiled instead. "You said I'm guilty, I agree, but I can't agree with this sentence."

"I had no choice but to come here, so I just made mistakes along the way." Xia Wushuang's voice was faint, "It's been over a decade now, and you come here to tell me that everything I did was wrong, and the consequences were severe... That's fine."

"But." Xia Wushuang said, "You can't deny that I exist here."

The old man paused for a moment and smiled slightly. "I think you should have a request for me."
"I have a request for you," Xia Wushuang said. "Because I am a human being with emotions and desires, if I do something wrong, I will feel guilty. So I have a request for you - there is no way to redeem the sins I have committed, but at least I want to know how to make up for it."

"If you can't even confirm my existence, then whatever I do is meaningless."

"I, Xia Wushuang, never do meaningless things."

The old man listened and remained silent for a long time.

"Well then..."

"Thump."

A dull sound.

The old man was taken aback.

This person knelt in front of him.

"Please tell me what to do," Xia Wushuang's voice was calm. "I want to know how to make amends."

"..."

The fierce girl who had just been aggressive turned her face and knelt in front of him, and the old man was momentarily taken aback.

"I admit my own existence, so I know the sins I have committed," Xia Wushuang said. "If you say that I don't exist, wouldn't it become an excuse for me to avoid responsibility?"

The old man was speechless for a while.

"...you can get up, after all, it wasn't entirely your fault at the beginning."

"Please tell me what to do," Xia Wushuang didn't get up.

"...this can't be completely resolved," the old man sighed. "But it can be suppressed."

"I will tell you the method, as for how to do it, it's up to you..." The old man felt the oppressive manic power that was about to break free from Xia Wushuang's body. He paused and said, "Do you have any strength left?"

With the power of the two lost deer and the power of the soul on the sword, the calamity was almost uncontrollable...

This heavenly punishment was truly terrifying.

"You tell me, I will definitely do it," Xia Wushuang said.
The old man finally revealed the method to her.

After listening, Xia Wushuang stood up, took the deer's hand, and didn't say anything. Finally, she asked, "May I know who you are?"

The old man shook his head, "I am just an unknown priest. I knew of your existence more than ten years ago, but I made an oath not to ask about worldly affairs, so..."

Xia Wushuang knew what he wanted to say.

If this old man had not made an oath and was an influential priest, she would not have been able to live peacefully on this continent for more than ten years.

He paused.

"So, now I only tell you what to do, which is not considered as interfering in the world. After all, I regret not killing you back then."

Xia Wushuang said, "Then I have to thank you for not killing me twice."

The old priest shook his head, "You don't have to say it... If I weren't so old, I would still kill you for those things."

Xia Wushuang said seriously, "Then I have to thank you for not killing me twice."

The old man: "..."

After bidding farewell to the old man, Xia Wushuang looked at the bright sky, but her mood was unusually heavy.

She had already thought about all the possible consequences before deciding to help Chu Shi.

But she never thought that the consequences would be so severe.

The scene of the village being attacked by evil spirits was vivid in her mind.

Xia Wushuang thought of the old priest who was guarding the village entrance yesterday and smiled self-deprecatingly.

That old priest probably knew that the village was going to be attacked by evil spirits, so he deliberately waited for her there, afraid that she would just pass by and still play her flute to attract her attention.

Now... no matter what she wants to do, she has to go back to Lingxi Peak first.

Xia Wushuang touched the deer's head and tried to show a friendly smile, but she couldn't smile no matter how hard she tried. Finally, she sighed, "Little babies, let's go home with me."
